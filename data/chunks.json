primary goal is to present material of practical \nvalue, but all three of us are active researchers in finan-cial economics and find virtually all of the material in this book to be of great intellectual interest. Fortunately, we think, there is no contradiction in the field of investments between the pursuit of truth and the pursuit of money. Quite the opposite. The capital asset pricing model, the arbitrage pricing model, the efficient markets hypothesis, the option-pricing model, and the other centerpieces of modern financial research are as much intellectually satis-fying subjects of scientific inquiry as they are of immense practical importance for the sophisticated investor. \n In our effort to link theory to practice, we also have \nattempted to make our approach consistent with that of the CFA Institute. In addition to fostering research in finance, the CFA Institute administers an education and certifi-cation program to candidates seeking designation as a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). The CFA curriculum represents the consensus of a committee of distinguished scholars and practitioners regarding the core of knowledge required by the investment professional. \n Many features of this text make it consistent with and \nrelevant to the CFA curriculum. Questions from past CFA exams appear at the end of nearly every chapter, and, for students who will be taking the exam, those same ques-tions and the exam from which they\u2019ve been taken are listed at the end of the book. Chapter 3 includes excerpts from the \u201cCode of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct\u201d of the CFA Institute. Chapter 28, which dis-cusses investors and the investment process, presents the   W e\u2019ve just ended three decades of rapid and pro-found change in the investments industry as well as a financial crisis of historic magnitude. \nThe vast expansion of financial markets during this period was due in part to innovations in securitization and credit enhancement that gave birth to new trading strategies. These strategies were in turn made feasible by develop-ments in communication and information technology, as well as by advances in the theory of investments. \n Yet the financial crisis also was rooted in the cracks \nof these developments. Many of the innovations in secu-rity design facilitated high leverage and an exaggerated notion of the efficacy of risk transfer strategies. This engendered complacency about risk that was coupled with relaxation of regulation as well as reduced trans-parency, masking the precarious condition of many big players in the system. Of necessity, our text has evolved along with financial markets and their influence on world events. \n Investments, Tenth Edition, is intended primarily as a \ntextbook for courses in investment analysis. Our guiding principle has been to present the material in a framework that is organized by a central core of consistent fundamen-tal principles. We attempt to strip away unnecessary math-ematical and technical detail, and we have concentrated on providing the intuition that may guide students and practitioners as they confront new ideas and challenges in their professional lives. \n This text will introduce you to major issues currently \nof concern to all investors. It can give you the skills to conduct a sophisticated assessment of watershed current issues and debates covered by the popular media as well as more-specialized finance journals. Whether you plan to   Preface \nbod61671_fm_i-xxviii.indd   xvibod61671_fm_i-xxviii.indd   xvi 7/31/13   7:22 PM7/31/13   7:22 PMFinal PDF to printer\nPreface\nxviiCFA Institute\u2019s framework for systematically relating \ninvestor objectives and constraints to ultimate investment policy. End-of-chapter problems also include questions from test-prep leader Kaplan Schweser. \n In the Tenth Edition, we have continued our systematic \ncollection of Excel spreadsheets that give tools to explore concepts more deeply than was previously possible. These spreadsheets, available on the Web site for this text (  www.mhhe.com/bkm  ), provide a taste of the sophisticated ana-lytic tools available to professional investors. \n  UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY \n  In the Tenth Edition, we address many of the changes in \nthe investment environment, including the unprecedented events surrounding the financial crisis. \n At the same time, many basic  principles  remain impor-\ntant. We believe that attention to these few important principles can simplify the study of otherwise difficult material and that fundamental principles should orga-nize and motivate all study. These principles are crucial to understanding the securities traded in financial markets and in understanding new securities that will be intro-duced in the future, as well as their effects on global mar-kets. For this reason, we have made this book thematic, meaning we never offer rules of thumb without reference to the central tenets of the modern approach to finance. \n The common theme unifying this book is that  security \nmarkets are nearly efficient,  meaning most securities are usually priced appropriately given their risk and return attributes. Free lunches are rarely found in markets as competitive as the financial market. This simple observa-tion is, nevertheless, remarkably powerful in its implica-tions for the design of investment strategies; as a result, our discussions of strategy are always guided by the implications of the efficient markets hypothesis. While the degree of market efficiency is, and always will be, a matter of debate (in fact we devote a full chapter to the behavioral challenge to the efficient market hypothesis), we hope our discussions throughout the book convey a good dose of healthy criticism concerning much conven-tional wisdom.  \n   Distinctive Themes \n  Investments  is organized around several important themes:\n    1 .   The central theme  is the near-informational-efficiency \nof well-developed security markets, such as those in the \nUnited States, and the general awareness that competi-tive markets do not offer \u201cfree lunches\u201d to participants.   A second theme is the risk\u2013return trade-off. This too \nis a no-free-lunch notion, holding that in competi-tive security markets, higher expected returns come only at a price: the need to bear greater investment risk. However, this notion leaves several questions unanswered. How should one measure the risk of an asset? What should be the quantitative trade-off between risk (properly measured) and expected return? The approach we present to these issues is known as  modern portfolio theory,  which is another \norganizing principle of this book. Modern portfolio theory focuses on the techniques and implications of  efficient diversification,  and we devote considerable \nattention to the effect of diversification on portfolio risk as well as the implications of efficient diversi-fication for the proper measurement of risk and the risk\u2013return relationship.  \n   2.  This text places  greater emphasis on asset allocation \nthan most of its competitors. We prefer this empha-sis for two important reasons. First, it corresponds to the procedure that most individuals actually follow. Typically, you start with all of your money in a bank account, only then considering how much to invest in something riskier that might offer a higher expected return. The logical step at this point is to consider risky asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. This is an asset allocation decision. Second, in most cases, the asset allocation choice is far more important in determining overall investment perfor-mance than is the set of security selection decisions. Asset allocation is the primary determinant of the risk\u2013return profile of the investment portfolio, and so it deserves primary attention in a study of investment policy.  \n   3.  This text offers  a much broader and deeper treat-\nment of futures, options, and other derivative secu-rity markets than most investments texts. These markets have become both crucial and integral to the financial universe. Your only choice is to become conversant in these markets\u2014whether you are to be a finance professional or simply a sophisticated indi-vidual investor.       \n  NEW IN THE TENTH EDITION \n  The following is a guide to changes in the Tenth Edition. \nThis is not an exhaustive road map, but instead is meant to provide an overview of substantial additions and changes to coverage from the last edition of the text.  \nbod61671_fm_i-xxviii.indd   xviibod61671_fm_i-xxviii.indd   xvii 7/31/13   7:22 PM7/31/13   7:22 PMFinal PDF to printer\nPreface\nxviiiconcerning the use of financial ratios as tools to evaluate \nfirm performance.  \n  Chapter 21 Option Valuation \n We have added substantial new sections on risk-neutral valuation methods and their implementation in the bino-mial option-pricing model, as well as the implications of the option pricing model for tail risk and financial instability.  \n  Chapter 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation \n New sections on the vulnerability of standard perfor-mance measures to manipulation, manipulation-free mea-sures, and the Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return have been added.    \n  ORGANIZATION AND CONTENT \n  The text is composed of seven sections that are fairly inde-\npendent and may be studied in a variety of sequences. Because there is enough material in the book for a two-semester course, clearly a one-semester course will require the instructor to decide which parts to include. \n  Part One  is introductory and contains important insti-\ntutional material focusing on the financial environment. We discuss the major players in the financial markets, provide an overview of the types of securities traded in those markets, and explain how and where securities are traded. We also discuss in depth mutual funds and other investment companies, which have become an increas-ingly important means of investing for individual inves-tors. Perhaps most important, we address how financial markets can influence all aspects of the global economy, as in 2008. \n The material presented in Part One should make it \npossible for instructors to assign term projects early in the course. These projects might require the student to analyze in detail a particular group of securities. Many instructors like to involve their students in some sort of investment game, and the material in these chapters will facilitate this process. \n  Parts Two and Three  contain the core of modern \nportfolio theory. Chapter 5 is a general discussion of risk and return, making the general point that historical returns on broad asset classes are consistent with a risk\u2013return trade-off, and examining the distribution of stock returns. We focus more closely in Chapter 6 on how to describe investors\u2019 risk preferences and how they bear on asset allocation. In the next two chapters, we turn to portfolio optimization (Chapter 7) and its implementation using index models (Chapter 8).    Chapter 1 The Investment Environment \n This chapter contains updated coverage of the consequences of the financial crisis as well as the Dodd-Frank act.  \n  Chapter 2 Asset Classes and Financial \nInstruments \n We devote additional attention to money markets, includ-\ning recent controversies concerning the regulation of money market mutual funds as well as the LIBOR scandal.  \n  Chapter 3 How Securities Are Traded \n We have extensively rewritten this chapter and included new sections that detail the rise of electronic markets, algorithmic and high-speed trading, and changes in mar-ket structure.  \n  Chapter 5 Risk, Return, and the \nHistorical Record \n This chapter has been updated with considerable attention \npaid to evidence on tail risk and extreme stock returns.  \n  Chapter 9 The Capital Asset Pricing Model \n We have streamlined the explanation of the simple CAPM and updated and integrated the sections dealing with extensions of the CAPM, tying together extra-market hedging demands and factor risk premia.  \n  Chapter 10 Arbitrage Pricing Theory \n The chapter contains new material on the practical feasi-bility of creating well-diversified portfolios and the impli-cations for asset pricing.  \n  Chapter 11 The Efficient Market Hypothesis \n We have added new material documenting the behavior of market anomalies over time, suggesting how market inef-ficiencies seem to be corrected.  \n  Chapter 13 Empirical Evidence on Security \nReturns \n Increased attention is given to tests of multifactor models \nof risk and return and the implications of these tests for the importance of extra-market hedging demands.  \n  Chapter 14 Bond Prices and Yields \n This chapter includes new material on sovereign credit default swaps.  \n  Chapter 18 Equity Valuation Models \n This chapter includes a new section on the practical prob-lems entailed in using DCF security valuation models and the response of value investors to these problems.  \n  Chapter 19 Financial Statement Analysis \n We have added a new introduction to the discussion of ratio analysis, providing greater structure and rationale \nbod61671_fm_i-xxviii.indd   xviiibod61671_fm_i-xxviii.indd   xviii 7/31/13   7:22 PM7/31/13   7:22 PMFinal PDF to printer\nPreface\nxix After our treatment of modern portfolio theory in Part \nTwo, we investigate in Part Three the implications of that \ntheory for the equilibrium structure of expected rates of return on risky assets. Chapter 9 treats the capital asset pricing model and Chapter 10 covers multifactor descrip-tions of risk and the arbitrage pricing theory. Chapter 11 covers the efficient market hypothesis, including its ratio-nale as well as evidence that supports the hypothesis and challenges it. Chapter 12 is devoted to the behavioral critique of market rationality. Finally, we conclude Part Three with Chapter 13 on empirical evidence on security pricing. This chapter contains evidence concerning the risk\u2013return relationship, as well as liquidity effects on asset pricing.   Part Four  is the first of three parts on security valu-\nation. This part treats fixed-income securities\u2014bond pricing (Chapter 14), term structure relationships (Chap-ter 15), and interest-rate risk management (Chapter 16).  Parts Five and Six  deal with equity securities and \nderivative securities. For a course emphasizing security analysis and excluding portfolio theory, one may pro-ceed directly from Part One to Part Four with no loss in continuity. \n Finally,  Part Seven  considers several topics important \nfor portfolio managers, including performance evalua-tion, international diversification, active management, and practical issues in the process of portfolio management. This part also contains a chapter on hedge funds.    \nbod61671_fm_i-xxviii.indd   xixbod61671_fm_i-xxviii.indd   xix 7/31/13   7:22 PM7/31/13   7:22 PMFinal PDF to printer\nxx  A Guided Tour \n This book contains several features designed \nto make it easy for students to understand, \nabsorb, and apply the concepts and techniques \npresented. \n 1 1 \n   AN INVESTMENT IS \u00a0the  current   commitment \nof money or other resources in the expecta-\ntion of reaping  future   benefits. For example, \nan individual might purchase shares of stock \nanticipating that the future proceeds from the \nshares will justify both the time that her money \nis tied up as well as the risk of the investment. \nThe time you will spend studying this text \n(not to mention its cost) also is an investment. \nYou are forgoing either current leisure or the \nincome you could be earning at a job in the \nexpectation that your future career will be suf-\nficiently enhanced to justify this commitment \nof time and effort. While these two invest-\nments differ in many ways, they share one key \nattribute that is central to all investments: You  Broadly speaking, this chapter addresses \nthree topics that will provide a useful perspec-\ntive for the material that is to come later. First, \nbefore delving into the topic of \u201cinvestments,\u201d \nwe consider the role of financial assets in the \neconomy. We discuss the relationship between \nsecurities and the \u201creal\u201d assets that actually \nproduce goods and services for consumers, and \nwe consider why financial assets are important \nto the functioning of a developed economy. \n Given this background, we then take a \nfirst look at the types of decisions that con-\nfront investors as they assemble a portfolio of \nassets. These investment decisions are made \nin an environment where higher returns \nusually can be obtained only at the price of  The Investment \nEnvironment      CHAPTER ONE  \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   1 03/05/13   12:08 AM\n  NUMBERED EXAMPLES \nNUMBERED AND TITLED   examples are \nintegrated throughout chapters.

In a liquidation of the firm\u2019s assets the \nshareholders have a claim to what is left after all other claimants such as the tax authorities, \nemployees, suppliers, bondholders, and other creditors have been paid. For a firm not in \nliquidation, shareholders have claim to the part of operating income left over after inter-\nest and taxes have been paid. Management can either pay \nthis residual as cash dividends to shareholders or reinvest \nit in the business to increase the value of the shares.  \n Limited liability means that the most shareholders \ncan lose in the event of failure of the corporation is their \noriginal investment. Unlike owners of unincorporated \nbusinesses, whose creditors can lay claim to the personal \nassets of the owner (house, car, furniture), corporate \nshareholders may at worst have worthless stock. They are \nnot personally liable for the firm\u2019s obligations.  \nStock Market Listings     a.  If you buy 100 shares of IBM stock, to what \nare you entitled?  \n    b.

As a result, more investors are \nchoosing simply to invest in funds tracking the indexes, \nwhich carry lower fees and are perceived as having \nless risk. \n The mission of stock pickers in a managed mutual fund \nis to outperform the overall market by actively trading \nindividual stocks or bonds, with fund managers receiving \nhigher fees for their effort. In an ETF (or indexed mutual \nfund), managers balance the share makeup of the fund \nso it accurately reflects the performance of its underlying \nindex, charging lower fees.  Morningstar says that when investors have put money \nin stock funds, they have chosen low-cost index funds and \nETFs. Some index ETFs cost less than 0.1% of assets a year, \nwhile many actively managed stock funds charge 1% a \nyear or more. \n While the trend has put increasing pressure lately on \nstock pickers, it is shifting the fortunes of some of the big-\ngest players in the $14 trillion mutual-fund industry. \n Fidelity Investments and American Funds, among the \nlargest in the category, saw redemptions or weak investor \ninterest compared with competitors, according to an anal-\nysis of mutual-fund flows done for  The Wall Street Journal   \nby research firm Strategic Insight, a unit of New York-based \nAsset International. \n At the other end of the spectrum, Vanguard, the \nworld\u2019s largest provider of index mutual funds, pulled in a \nnet $141 billion last year through December, according to \nthe company. \n Many investors say they are looking for a way to invest \ncheaply, with less risk. \n  Source:   Adapted from Kirsten Grind, \u201cInvestors Sour on Pro Stock \nPickers\u201d  The   Wall Street Journal,   January 3, 2013.  WORDS FROM THE STREET \nor a mutual fund company that operates a market index fund. Vanguard, for example, oper-\nates the Index 500 Portfolio that mimics the S&P 500 index fund. It purchases shares of the \nfirms constituting the S&P 500 in proportion to the market values of the outstanding equity \nof each firm, and therefore essentially replicates the S&P 500 index. The fund thus dupli-\ncates the performance of this market index. It has one of the lowest operating expenses \n(as a percentage of assets) of all mutual stock funds precisely because it requires minimal \nmanagerial effort. \n A second reason to pursue a passive strategy is the free-rider benefit.

The Fisher equation tells us that the real interest rate approximately equals the nominal rate minus \nthe inflation rate. Suppose the inflation rate increases from 3% to 5%. Does the Fisher equation \nimply that this increase will result in a fall in the real rate of interest? Explain.  \n   2. You\u2019ve just stumbled on a new dataset that enables you to compute historical rates of return on \nU.S. stocks all the way back to 1880. What are the advantages and disadvantages in using these \ndata to help estimate the expected rate of return on U.S. stocks over the coming year?  \n   3. You are considering two alternative 2-year investments: You can invest in a risky asset with a \npositive risk premium and returns in each of the 2 years that will be identically distributed and \nuncorrelated, or you can invest in the risky asset for only 1 year and then invest the proceeds in \na risk-free asset. Which of the following statements about the first investment alternative (com-\npared with the second) are true?\n     a.  Its 2-year risk premium is the same as the second alternative.  \n    b.  The standard deviation of its 2-year return is the same.  \n    c.  Its annualized standard deviation is lower.  \n    d.  Its Sharpe ratio is higher.  \n    e.  It is relatively more attractive to investors who have lower degrees of risk aversion.        \n    4. You have $5,000 to invest for the next year and are considering three alternatives:\n     a.  A money market fund with an average maturity of 30 days offering a current yield of 6% per \nyear.  \n    b.  A 1-year savings deposit at a bank offering an interest rate of 7.5%.  \n    c.  A 20-year U.S. Treasury bond offering a yield to maturity of 9% per year.    \n What role does your forecast of future interest rates play in your decisions?  \n   5. Use  Figure\u00a05.1  in the text to analyze the effect of the following on the level of real interest rates:\n     a.  Businesses become more pessimistic about future demand for their products and decide to \nreduce their capital spending.  \n    b.  Households are induced to save more because of increased uncertainty about their future \nSocial Security benefits.  \n    c.  The Federal Reserve Board undertakes open-market purchases of U.S. Treasury securities in \norder to increase the supply of money.

What is the expected rate of return for a stock that has a beta of 1.0 if the expected return on the \nmarket is 15%?\n     a.  15%.  \n    b.  More than 15%.  \n    c.  Cannot be determined without the risk-free rate.     \n   7. Kaskin, Inc., stock has a beta of 1.2 and Quinn, Inc., stock has a beta of .6. Which of the follow-\ning statements is  most   accurate?\n     a.  The expected rate of return will be higher for the stock of Kaskin, Inc., than that of Quinn, Inc.  \n    b.  The stock of Kaskin, Inc., has more total risk than Quinn, Inc.  \n    c.  The stock of Quinn, Inc., has more systematic risk than that of Kaskin, Inc.        \n    8.

These sites make it \neasy for students to research topics \nfurther and retrieve financial data and \ninformation.   \nVisit us at www.m    1 .   Unit investment trusts, closed-end management companies, and open-end management compa-\nnies are all classified and regulated as investment companies. Unit investment trusts are essen-\ntially unmanaged in the sense that the portfolio, once established, is fixed. Managed investment \ncompanies, in contrast, may change the composition of the portfolio as deemed fit by the portfo-\nlio manager. Closed-end funds are traded like other securities; they do not redeem shares for their \ninvestors. Open-end funds will redeem shares for net asset value at the request of the investor.  \n    2 .   Net asset value equals the market value of assets held by a fund minus the liabilities of the fund \ndivided by the shares outstanding.  \n    3 .   Mutual funds free the individual from many of the administrative burdens of owning individual \nsecurities and offer professional management of the portfolio. They also offer advantages that are \navailable only to large-scale investors, such as discounted trading costs. On the other hand, funds \nare assessed management fees and incur other expenses, which reduce the investor\u2019s rate of return. \nFunds also eliminate some of the individual\u2019s control over the timing of capital gains realizations.  \n    4 .   Mutual funds are often categorized by investment policy. Major policy groups include money \nmarket funds; equity funds, which are further grouped according to emphasis on income versus \ngrowth; fixed-income funds; balanced and income funds; asset allocation funds; index funds; and \nspecialized sector funds.  \n    5 .   Costs of investing in mutual funds include front-end loads, which are sales charges; back-end \nloads, which are redemption fees or, more formally, contingent-deferred sales charges; fund oper-\nating expenses; and 12b-1 charges, which are recurring fees used to pay for the expenses of mar-\nketing the fund to the public.  \n    6 .   Income earned on mutual fund portfolios is not taxed at the level of the fund. Instead, as long as \nthe fund meets certain requirements for pass-through status, the income is treated as being earned \nby the investors in the fund.

For example, \nan individual might purchase shares of stock anticipating that the future proceeds from the shares will justify both the time that her money is tied up as well as the risk of the investment. The time you will spend studying this text (not to mention its cost) also is an investment. You are forgoing either current leisure or the income you could be earning at a job in the expectation that your future career will be suf-ficiently enhanced to justify this commitment of time and effort. While these two invest-ments differ in many ways, they share one key attribute that is central to all investments: You sacrifice something of value now, expecting to benefit from that sacrifice later. \n This text can help you become an informed \npractitioner of investments. We will focus on \ninvestments in securities such as stocks, bonds, or options and futures contracts, but much of what we discuss will be useful in the analysis of any type of investment. The text will pro-vide you with background in the organization of various securities markets; will survey the valuation and risk-management principles useful in particular markets, such as those for bonds or stocks; and will introduce you to the principles of portfolio construction.  Broadly speaking, this chapter addresses \nthree topics that will provide a useful perspec-\ntive for the material that is to come later. First, before delving into the topic of \u201cinvestments,\u201d we consider the role of financial assets in the economy. We discuss the relationship between securities and the \u201creal\u201d assets that actually produce goods and services for consumers, and we consider why financial assets are important to the functioning of a developed economy. \n Given this background, we then take a \nfirst look at the types of decisions that con-\nfront investors as they assemble a portfolio of assets. These investment decisions are made in an environment where higher returns usually can be obtained only at the price of greater risk and in which it is rare to find assets that are so mispriced as to be obvi-ous bargains. These themes\u2014the risk\u2013return trade-off and the efficient pricing of financial assets\u2014are central to the investment process, so it is worth pausing for a brief discussion of their implications as we begin the text. These implications will be fleshed out in much greater detail in later chapters. \n We provide an overview of the organiza-\ntion of security markets as well as the vari-\nous players that participate in those markets. Together, these introductions should give you a feel for who the major participants are in  The Investment \nEnvironment      CHAPTER ONE  \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   1bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   1 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2(concluded)\nthe securities markets as well as the setting in \nwhich they act. Finally, we discuss the financial crisis that began playing out in 2007 and peaked in 2008. The crisis dramatically illustrated the connections between the financial system and the \u201creal\u201d side of the economy. We look at the origins of the crisis and the lessons that may be drawn about systemic risk. We close the chapter with an overview of the remainder of the text.  \n  1 You might wonder why real assets held by households in  Table\u00a01.1  amount to $23,774 billion, while total real \nassets in the domestic economy ( Table\u00a01.2 ) are far larger, at $48,616 billion. A big part of the difference reflects \nthe fact that real assets held by firms, for example, property, plant, and equipment, are included as  financial  assets \nof the household sector, specifically through the value of corporate equity and other stock market investments. Also,  Table\u00a01.2  includes assets of noncorporate businesses. Finally, there are some differences in valuation meth-ods. For example, equity and stock investments in  Table\u00a01.1  are measured by market value, whereas plant and equipment in  Table\u00a01.2  are valued at replacement cost.   The material wealth of a society is ultimately determined by the productive capacity of its \neconomy, that is, the goods and services its members can create. This capacity is a function of the    real assets    of the economy: the land, buildings, machines, and knowledge that can \nbe used to produce goods and services. \n In contrast to real assets are    financial assets    such as stocks and bonds. Such securi-\nties are no more than sheets of paper or, more likely, computer entries, and they do not contribute directly to the productive capacity of the economy. Instead, these assets are the means by which individuals in well-developed economies hold their claims on real assets. Financial assets are claims to the income generated by real assets (or claims on income from the government). If we cannot own our own auto plant (a real asset), we can still buy shares in Ford or Toyota (financial assets) and thereby share in the income derived from the production of automobiles. \n While real assets generate net income to the economy, financial assets simply define the \nallocation of income or wealth among investors. Individuals can choose between consum-ing their wealth today or investing for the future. If they choose to invest, they may place their wealth in financial assets by purchasing various securities. When investors buy these securities from companies, the firms use the money so raised to pay for real assets, such as plant, equipment, technology, or inventory. So investors\u2019 returns on securities ultimately come from the income produced by the real assets that were financed by the issuance of those securities. \n The distinction between real and financial assets is apparent when we compare the bal-\nance sheet of U.S. households, shown in  Table\u00a01.1 , with the composition of national wealth in the United States, shown in  Table\u00a01.2 . Household wealth includes financial assets such as \nbank accounts, corporate stock, or bonds. However, these securities, which are financial assets of households, are  liabilities  of the issuers of the securities. For example, \na bond that you treat as an asset because it gives you a claim on interest income and repayment of principal from Toyota is a liability of Toyota, which is obligated to make these payments to you. Your asset is Toyota\u2019s liability. Therefore, when we aggregate over all balance sheets, these claims cancel out, leaving only real assets as the net wealth of the economy. National wealth consists of struc-tures, equipment, inventories of goods, and land.  \n1          1.1 Real Assets versus Financial Assets \n Are the following assets real or financial? \n     a.

Fixed-income    or    debt securities    promise either a fixed stream of \nincome or a stream of income determined by a specified formula. For example, a corporate \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   3bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   3 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4  PART I  Introduction\nbond typically would promise that the bondholder will receive a fixed amount of interest \neach year. Other so-called floating-rate bonds promise payments that depend on current interest rates. For example, a bond may pay an interest rate that is fixed at 2 percentage points above the rate paid on U.S. Treasury bills. Unless the borrower is declared bankrupt, the payments on these securities are either fixed or determined by formula. For this reason, the investment performance of debt securities typically is least closely tied to the financial condition of the issuer. \n Nevertheless, fixed-income securities come in a tremendous variety of maturities and \npayment provisions. At one extreme, the  money market  refers to debt securities that are \nshort term, highly marketable, and generally of very low risk. Examples of money market securities are U.S. Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit (CDs). In contrast, the fixed-income  capital market  includes long-term securities such as Treasury bonds, as well \nas bonds issued by federal agencies, state and local municipalities, and corporations. These bonds range from very safe in terms of default risk (for example, Treasury securities) to relatively risky (for example, high-yield or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds). They also are designed with extremely diverse provisions regarding payments provided to the investor and protection against the bankruptcy of the issuer. We will take a first look at these securities in Chapter\u00a02 and undertake a more detailed analysis of the debt market in Part Four. \n Unlike debt securities, common stock, or  equity,  in a firm represents an ownership \nshare in the corporation. Equityholders are not promised any particular payment. They receive any dividends the firm may pay and have prorated ownership in the real assets of the firm. If the firm is successful, the value of equity will increase; if not, it will decrease. The performance of equity investments, therefore, is tied directly to the success of the firm and its real assets. For this reason, equity investments tend to be riskier than investments in debt securities. Equity markets and equity valuation are the topics of Part Five. \n Finally,    derivative securities    such as options and futures contracts provide payoffs that \nare determined by the prices of  other  assets such as bond or stock prices. For example, a \ncall option on a share of Intel stock might turn out to be worthless if Intel\u2019s share price remains below a threshold or \u201cexercise\u201d price such as $20 a share, but it can be quite valu-able if the stock price rises above that level.  \n2   Derivative securities are so named because \ntheir values derive from the prices of other assets. For example, the value of the call option will depend on the price of Intel stock. Other important derivative securities are futures and swap contracts. We will treat these in Part Six.  \n Derivatives have become an integral part of the investment environment. One use of \nderivatives, perhaps the primary use, is to hedge risks or transfer them to other parties. This is done successfully every day, and the use of these securities for risk management is so commonplace that the multitrillion-dollar market in derivative assets is routinely taken for granted. Derivatives also can be used to take highly speculative positions, however. Every so often, one of these positions blows up, resulting in well-publicized losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. While these losses attract considerable attention, they are in fact the exception to the more common use of such securities as risk management tools. Derivatives will continue to play an important role in portfolio construction and the finan-cial system. We will return to this topic later in the text. \n Investors and corporations regularly encounter other financial markets as well. Firms \nengaged in international trade regularly transfer money back and forth between dollars and \n  2 A call option is the right to buy a share of stock at a given exercise price on or before the option\u2019s expiration \ndate. If the market price of Intel remains below $20 a share, the right to buy for $20 will turn out to be valueless. \nIf the share price rises above $20 before the option expires, however, the option can be exercised to obtain the share for only $20. \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   4bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   4 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 1 The Investment Environment 5\nother currencies. Well more than a trillion dollars of currency is traded each day in the mar-\nket for foreign exchange, primarily through a network of the largest international banks. \n Investors also might invest directly in some real assets. For example, dozens of commod-\nities are traded on exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade. You can buy or sell corn, wheat, natural gas, gold, silver, and so on. \n Commodity and derivative markets allow firms to adjust their exposure to various busi-\nness risks. For example, a construction firm may lock in the price of copper by buying copper futures contracts, thus eliminating the risk of a sudden jump in the price of its raw materials. Wherever there is uncertainty, investors may be interested in trading, either to speculate or to lay off their risks, and a market may arise to meet that demand.   \n   1.3 Financial Markets and the Economy \n  We stated earlier that real assets determine the wealth of an economy, while financial assets merely represent claims on real assets. Nevertheless, financial assets and the markets in which they trade play several crucial roles in developed economies. Financial assets allow us to make the most of the economy\u2019s real assets.  \n   The Informational Role of Financial Markets \n Stock prices reflect investors\u2019 collective assessment of a firm\u2019s current performance and future prospects. When the market is more optimistic about the firm, its share price will rise. That higher price makes it easier for the firm to raise capital and therefore encour-ages investment. In this manner, stock prices play a major role in the allocation of capi-tal in market economies, directing capital to the firms and applications with the greatest  perceived potential. \n Do capital markets actually channel resources to the most efficient use? At times, they \nappear to fail miserably. Companies or whole industries can be \u201chot\u201d for a period of time (think about the dot-com bubble that peaked in 2000), attract a large flow of investor capi-tal, and then fail after only a few years. The process seems highly wasteful. \n But we need to be careful about our standard of efficiency. No one knows with certainty \nwhich ventures will succeed and which will fail. It is therefore unreasonable to expect that markets will never make mistakes. The stock market encourages allocation of capital to those firms that appear  at the time  to have the best prospects. Many smart, well-trained, \nand well-paid professionals analyze the prospects of firms whose shares trade on the stock market. Stock prices reflect their collective judgment. \n You may well be skeptical about resource allocation through markets. But if you are, \nthen take a moment to think about the alternatives. Would a central planner make fewer mistakes? Would you prefer that Congress make these decisions? To paraphrase Winston Churchill\u2019s comment about democracy, markets may be the worst way to allocate capital except for all the others that have been tried.  \n  Consumption Timing \n Some individuals in an economy are earning more than they currently wish to spend.  Others, for example, retirees, spend more than they currently earn. How can you shift your purchasing power from high-earnings periods to low-earnings periods of life? One way is to \u201cstore\u201d your wealth in financial assets. In high-earnings periods, you can invest your savings in financial assets such as stocks and bonds. In low-earnings periods, you can sell these assets to provide funds for your consumption needs. By so doing, you can \u201cshift\u201d your consumption over the course of your lifetime, thereby allocating your consumption to \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   5bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   5 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6  PART I  Introduction\nperiods that provide the greatest satisfaction. Thus, financial markets allow individuals to \nseparate decisions concerning current consumption from constraints that otherwise would be imposed by current earnings.  \n  Allocation of Risk \n Virtually all real assets involve some risk. When Ford builds its auto plants, for example, it cannot know for sure what cash flows those plants will generate. Financial markets and the diverse financial instruments traded in those markets allow investors with the greatest taste for risk to bear that risk, while other, less risk-tolerant individuals can, to a greater extent, stay on the sidelines. For example, if Ford raises the funds to build its auto plant by selling both stocks and bonds to the public, the more optimistic or risk-tolerant investors can buy shares of its stock, while the more conservative ones can buy its bonds. Because the bonds promise to provide a fixed payment, the stockholders bear most of the business risk but reap potentially higher rewards. Thus, capital markets allow the risk that is inherent to all investments to be borne by the investors most willing to bear that risk. \n This allocation of risk also benefits the firms that need to raise capital to finance their \ninvestments. When investors are able to select security types with the risk-return character-istics that best suit their preferences, each security can be sold for the best possible price. This facilitates the process of building the economy\u2019s stock of real assets.  \n  Separation of Ownership and Management \n Many businesses are owned and managed by the same individual. This simple organiza-tion is well suited to small businesses and, in fact, was the most common form of business organization before the Industrial Revolution. Today, however, with global markets and large-scale production, the size and capital requirements of firms have skyrocketed. For example, in 2012 General Electric listed on its balance sheet about $70 billion of property, plant, and equipment, and total assets of $685 billion. Corporations of such size simply cannot exist as owner-operated firms. GE actually has more than half a million stockhold-ers with an ownership stake in the firm proportional to their holdings of shares. \n Such a large group of individuals obviously cannot actively participate in the day-to-\nday management of the firm. Instead, they elect a board of directors that in turn hires and supervises the management of the firm. This structure means that the owners and manag-ers of the firm are different parties. This gives the firm a stability that the owner-managed firm cannot achieve. For example, if some stockholders decide they no longer wish to hold shares in the firm, they can sell their shares to other investors, with no impact on the man-agement of the firm. Thus, financial assets and the ability to buy and sell those assets in the financial markets allow for easy separation of ownership and management. \n How can all of the disparate owners of the firm, ranging from large pension funds hold-\ning hundreds of thousands of shares to small investors who may hold only a single share, agree on the objectives of the firm? Again, the financial markets provide some guidance. All may agree that the firm\u2019s management should pursue strategies that enhance the value of their shares. Such policies will make all shareholders wealthier and allow them all to better pursue their personal goals, whatever those goals might be. \n Do managers really attempt to maximize firm value? It is easy to see how they might \nbe tempted to engage in activities not in the best interest of shareholders. For example, they might engage in empire building or avoid risky projects to protect their own jobs or overconsume luxuries such as corporate jets, reasoning that the cost of such perquisites is largely borne by the shareholders. These potential conflicts of interest are called    agency \nproblems    because managers, who are hired as agents of the shareholders, may pursue their own interests instead. \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   6bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   6 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 1 The Investment Environment 7\n Several mechanisms have evolved to mitigate potential agency problems. First, com-\npensation plans tie the income of managers to the success of the firm. A major part of the \ntotal compensation of top executives is often in the form of stock or stock options, which means that the managers will not do well unless the stock price increases, benefiting share-holders. (Of course, we\u2019ve learned more recently that overuse of options can create its own agency problem. Options can create an incentive for managers to manipulate information to prop up a stock price temporarily, giving them a chance to cash out before the price returns to a level reflective of the firm\u2019s true prospects. More on this shortly.) Second, while boards of directors have sometimes been portrayed as defenders of top management, they can, and in recent years, increasingly have, forced out management teams that are underperforming. The average tenure of CEOs fell from 8.1 years in 2006 to 6.6 years in 2011, and the percentage of incoming CEOs who also serve as chairman of the board of directors fell from 48% in 2002 to less than 12% in 2009.  \n3   Third, outsiders such as security \nanalysts and large institutional investors such as mutual funds or pension funds monitor the firm closely and make the life of poor performers at the least uncomfortable. Such large investors today hold about half of the stock in publicly listed firms in the U.S.  \n Finally, bad performers are subject to the threat of takeover. If the board of directors is lax \nin monitoring management, unhappy shareholders in principle can elect a different board. They can do this by launching a  proxy contest  in which they seek to obtain enough proxies \n(i.e., rights to vote the shares of other shareholders) to take control of the firm and vote in another board. However, this threat is usually minimal. Shareholders who attempt such a fight have to use their own funds, while management can defend itself using corporate cof-fers. Most proxy fights fail. The real takeover threat is from other firms. If one firm observes another underperforming, it can acquire the underperforming business and replace manage-ment with its own team. The stock price should rise to reflect the prospects of improved performance, which provides incentive for firms to engage in such takeover activity.   \n  3 \u201cCorporate Bosses Are Much Less Powerful than They Used To Be,\u201d  The Economist,  January 21, 2012.  In February 2008, Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo! by paying its current shareholders \n$31 for each of their shares, a considerable premium to its closing price of $19.18 on the day before the offer. Yahoo\u2019s management rejected that offer and a better one at $33 a share; Yahoo\u2019s CEO Jerry Yang held out for $37 per share, a price that Yahoo! had not reached in more than 2 years. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn was outraged, arguing that management was protecting its own position at the expense of shareholder value. Icahn notified Yahoo! that he had been asked to \u201clead a proxy fight to attempt to remove the current board and to establish a new board which would attempt to negoti-ate a successful merger with Microsoft.\u201d To that end, he had purchased approximately 59 million shares of Yahoo! and formed a 10-person slate to stand for election against the current board. Despite this challenge, Yahoo\u2019s management held firm in its refusal of Microsoft\u2019s offer, and with the support of the board, Yang managed to fend off both Microsoft and Icahn. In July, Icahn agreed to end the proxy fight in return for three seats on the board to be held by his allies. But the 11-person board was still dominated by current Yahoo management. Yahoo\u2019s share price, which had risen to $29 a share during the Microsoft negotiations, fell back to around $21 a share. Given the difficulty that a well-known billionaire faced in defeating a determined and entrenched management, it is no wonder that proxy contests are rare. Historically, about three of four proxy fights go down to defeat.  Example 1.1 Carl Icahn\u2019s Proxy Fight with Yahoo! \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   7bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   7 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n8  PART I  Introduction\n  Corporate Governance and Corporate Ethics \n We\u2019ve argued that securities markets can play an important role in facilitating the deploy-\nment of capital resources to their most productive uses. But market signals will help to allocate capital efficiently only if investors are acting on accurate information. We say that markets need to be  transparent  for investors to make informed decisions. If firms can mis-\nlead the public about their prospects, then much can go wrong. \n Despite the many mechanisms to align incentives of shareholders and managers, the \nthree years from 2000 through 2002 were filled with a seemingly unending series of scan-dals that collectively signaled a crisis in corporate governance and ethics. For example, the telecom firm WorldCom overstated its profits by at least $3.8 billion by improperly classifying expenses as investments. When the true picture emerged, it resulted in the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, at least until Lehman Brothers smashed that record in 2008. The next-largest U.S. bankruptcy was Enron, which used its now-notorious \u201cspecial- purpose entities\u201d to move debt off its own books and similarly present a misleading picture of its financial status. Unfortunately, these firms had plenty of company. Other firms such as Rite Aid, HealthSouth, Global Crossing, and Qwest Communications also manipulated and misstated their accounts to the tune of billions of dollars. And the scandals were hardly limited to the United States. Parmalat, the Italian dairy firm, claimed to have a $4.8 billion bank account that turned out not to exist. These episodes suggest that agency and incentive problems are far from solved. \n Other scandals of that period included systematically misleading and overly optimistic \nresearch reports put out by stock market analysts. (Their favorable analysis was traded for the promise of future investment banking business, and analysts were commonly compen-sated not for their accuracy or insight, but for their role in garnering investment banking business for their firms.) Additionally, initial public offerings were allocated to corporate executives as a quid pro quo for personal favors or the promise to direct future business back to the manager of the IPO. \n What about the auditors who were supposed to be the watchdogs of the firms? Here \ntoo, incentives were skewed. Recent changes in business practice had made the consulting businesses of these firms more lucrative than the auditing function. For example, Enron\u2019s (now-defunct) auditor Arthur Andersen earned more money consulting for Enron than by auditing it; given Arthur Andersen\u2019s incentive to protect its consulting profits, we should not be surprised that it, and other auditors, were overly lenient in their auditing work. \n In 2002, in response to the spate of ethics scandals, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct to tighten the rules of corporate governance. For example, the act requires corporations to have more independent directors, that is, more directors who are not themselves manag-ers (or affiliated with managers). The act also requires each CFO to personally vouch for the corporation\u2019s accounting statements, created an oversight board to oversee the audit-ing of public companies, and prohibits auditors from providing various other services to clients.    \n   1.4 The Investment Process \n  An investor\u2019s  portfolio  is simply his collection of investment assets. Once the portfolio is established, it is updated or \u201crebalanced\u201d by selling existing securities and using the  proceeds to buy new securities, by investing additional funds to increase the overall size of the portfolio, or by selling securities to decrease the size of the portfolio. \n Investment assets can be categorized into broad asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real \nestate, commodities, and so on. Investors make two types of decisions in constructing their \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   8bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   8 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 1 The Investment Environment 9\nportfolios. The    asset allocation    decision is the choice among these broad asset classes, \nwhile the    security selection    decision is the choice of which particular securities to hold \n within  each asset class. \n Asset allocation also includes the decision of how much of one\u2019s portfolio to place \nin safe assets such as bank accounts or money market securities versus in risky assets. \nUnfortunately, many observers, even those providing financial advice, appear to incor-rectly equate saving with safe investing.  \n4   \u201cSaving\u201d means that you do not spend all of your \ncurrent income, and therefore can add to your portfolio. You may choose to invest your savings in safe assets, risky assets, or a combination of both.  \n \u201cTop-down\u201d portfolio construction starts with asset allocation. For example, an individ-\nual who currently holds all of his money in a bank account would first decide what propor-tion of the overall portfolio ought to be moved into stocks, bonds, and so on. In this way, the broad features of the portfolio are established. For example, while the average annual return on the common stock of large firms since 1926 has been better than 11% per year, the average return on U.S. Treasury bills has been less than 4%. On the other hand, stocks are far riskier, with annual returns (as measured by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index) that have ranged as low as \u201346% and as high as 55%. In contrast, T-bills are effectively risk-free: You know what interest rate you will earn when you buy them. Therefore, the decision to allocate your investments to the stock market or to the money market where Treasury bills are traded will have great ramifications for both the risk and the return of your portfo-lio. A top-down investor first makes this and other crucial asset allocation decisions before turning to the decision of the particular securities to be held in each asset class. \n    Security analysis    involves the valuation of particular securities that might be included \nin the portfolio. For example, an investor might ask whether Merck or Pfizer is more attrac-tively priced. Both bonds and stocks must be evaluated for investment attractiveness, but valuation is far more difficult for stocks because a stock\u2019s performance usually is far more sensitive to the condition of the issuing firm. \n In contrast to top-down portfolio management is the \u201cbottom-up\u201d strategy. In this pro-\ncess, the portfolio is constructed from the securities that seem attractively priced without as much concern for the resultant asset allocation. Such a technique can result in unin-tended bets on one or another sector of the economy. For example, it might turn out that the portfolio ends up with a very heavy representation of firms in one industry, from one part of the country, or with exposure to one source of uncertainty. However, a bottom-up strategy does focus the portfolio on the assets that seem to offer the most attractive invest-ment opportunities.   \n  4 For example, here is a brief excerpt from the Web site of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cYour \n\u2018savings\u2019 are usually put into the safest places or products .\u00a0.\u00a0. When you \u2018invest,\u2019 you have a greater chance of \nlosing your money than when you \u2018save.\u2019\u201d This statement is incorrect: Your investment portfolio can be invested in either safe or risky assets, and your savings in any period is simply the difference between your income and consumption.    1.5 Markets Are Competitive  \n Financial markets are highly competitive. Thousands of intelligent and well-backed ana-\nlysts constantly scour securities markets searching for the best buys. This competition means that we should expect to find few, if any, \u201cfree lunches,\u201d securities that are so under-priced that they represent obvious bargains. This no-free-lunch proposition has several implications. Let\u2019s examine two.  \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   9bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   9 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 0  PART I  Introduction\n   The Risk\u2013Return Trade-Off \n Investors invest for anticipated future returns, but those returns rarely can be predicted \nprecisely. There will almost always be risk associated with investments. Actual or real-ized returns will almost always deviate from the expected return anticipated at the start of the investment period. For example, in 1931 (the worst calendar year for the market since 1926), the S&P 500 index fell by 46%. In 1933 (the best year), the index gained 55%. You can be sure that investors did not anticipate such extreme performance at the start of either of these years. \n Naturally, if all else could be held equal, investors would prefer investments with the \nhighest expected return.  \n5   However, the no-free-lunch rule tells us that all else cannot be \nheld equal. If you want higher expected returns, you will have to pay a price in terms of accepting higher investment risk. If higher expected return can be achieved without bear-ing extra risk, there will be a rush to buy the high-return assets, with the result that their prices will be driven up. Individuals considering investing in the asset at the now-higher price will find the investment less attractive: If you buy at a higher price, your expected rate of return (that is, profit per dollar invested) is lower. The asset will be considered attractive and its price will continue to rise until its expected return is no more than com-mensurate with risk. At this point, investors can anticipate a \u201cfair\u201d return relative to the asset\u2019s risk, but no more. Similarly, if returns were independent of risk, there would be a rush to sell high-risk assets. Their prices would fall (and their expected future rates of return rise) until they eventually were attractive enough to be included again in investor portfolios. We conclude that there should be a    risk\u2013return trade-off    in the securities \nmarkets, with higher-risk assets priced to offer higher expected returns than lower-risk assets.  \n Of course, this discussion leaves several important questions unanswered. How should \none measure the risk of an asset? What should be the quantitative trade-off between risk (properly measured) and expected return? One would think that risk would have some-thing to do with the volatility of an asset\u2019s returns, but this guess turns out to be only partly correct. When we mix assets into diversified portfolios, we need to consider the interplay among assets and the effect of diversification on the risk of the entire portfolio.  Diversification  means that many assets are held in the portfolio so that the exposure to \nany particular asset is limited. The effect of diversification on portfolio risk, the implica-tions for the proper measurement of risk, and the risk\u2013return relationship are the topics of Part Two. These topics are the subject of what has come to be known as  modern portfolio \ntheory.  The development of this theory brought two of its pioneers, Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe, Nobel Prizes.  \n  Efficient Markets \n Another implication of the no-free-lunch proposition is that we should rarely expect to find bargains in the security markets. We will spend all of Chapter 11 examining the theory and evidence concerning the hypothesis that financial markets process all available infor-mation about securities quickly and efficiently, that is, that the security price usually reflects all the information available to investors concerning its value. According to this hypothesis, as new information about a security becomes available, its price quickly \n  5 The \u201cexpected\u201d return is not the return investors believe they necessarily will earn, or even their most likely \nreturn. It is instead the result of averaging across all possible outcomes, recognizing that some outcomes are more \nlikely than others. It is the average rate of return across possible economic scenarios. \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   10bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   10 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 1 The Investment Environment 11\nadjusts so that at any time, the security price equals the market consensus estimate of the \nvalue of the security. If this were so, there would be neither underpriced nor overpriced securities. \n One interesting implication of this \u201cefficient market hypothesis\u201d concerns the choice \nbetween active and passive investment-management strategies.    Passive management    calls \nfor holding highly diversified portfolios without spending effort or other resources attempt-ing to improve investment performance through security analysis.    Active  management    is \nthe attempt to improve performance either by identifying mispriced securities or by timing the performance of broad asset classes\u2014for example, increasing one\u2019s commitment to stocks when one is bullish on the stock market. If markets are efficient and prices reflect all relevant information, perhaps it is better to follow passive strategies instead of spending resources in a futile attempt to outguess your competitors in the financial markets. \n If the efficient market hypothesis were taken to the extreme, there would be no point in \nactive security analysis; only fools would commit resources to actively analyze securities. Without ongoing security analysis, however, prices eventually would depart from \u201ccorrect\u201d values, creating new incentives for experts to move in. Therefore, even in environments as competitive as the financial markets, we may observe only  near -efficiency, and profit \nopportunities may exist for especially diligent and creative investors. In Chapter 12, we examine such challenges to the efficient market hypothesis, and this motivates our discus-sion of active portfolio management in Part Seven. More important, our discussions of security analysis and portfolio construction generally must account for the likelihood of nearly efficient markets.    \n   1.6 The Players \n  From a bird\u2019s-eye view, there would appear to be three major players in the financial markets:\n    1. Firms are net demanders of capital. They raise capital now to pay for investments \nin plant and equipment. The income generated by those real assets provides the returns to investors who purchase the securities issued by the firm.  \n   2. Households typically are net suppliers of capital. They purchase the securities \nissued by firms that need to raise funds.  \n   3. Governments can be borrowers or lenders, depending on the relationship between \ntax revenue and government expenditures. Since World War II, the U.S. government typically has run budget deficits, meaning that its tax receipts have been less than its expenditures. The government, therefore, has had to borrow funds to cover its budget deficit. Issuance of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds is the major way that the govern-ment borrows funds from the public. In contrast, in the latter part of the 1990s, the government enjoyed a budget surplus and was able to retire some outstanding debt.    \n Corporations and governments do not sell all or even most of their securities directly \nto individuals. For example, about half of all stock is held by large financial institutions such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and banks. These financial institutions stand between the security issuer (the firm) and the ultimate owner of the security (the individual investor). For this reason, they are called  financial intermediaries.  \nSimilarly, corporations do not market their own securities to the public. Instead, they hire agents, called investment bankers, to represent them to the investing public. Let\u2019s examine the roles of these intermediaries.  \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   11bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   11 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 2 PART I  Introduction\n   Financial Intermediaries \n Households want desirable investments for their savings, yet the small (financial) size \nof most households makes direct investment difficult. A small investor seeking to lend \nmoney to businesses that need to finance investments doesn\u2019t advertise in the local news-\npaper to find a willing and desirable borrower. Moreover, an individual lender would not \nbe able to diversify across borrowers to reduce risk. Finally, an individual lender is not \nequipped to assess and monitor the credit risk of borrowers. \n For these reasons,    financial intermediaries    have evolved to bring the suppliers of \ncapital (investors) together with the demanders of capital (primarily corporations and the \nfederal government). These financial intermediaries include banks, investment companies, \ninsurance companies, and credit unions. Financial intermediaries issue their own securities \nto raise funds to purchase the securities of other corporations. \n For example, a bank raises funds by borrowing (taking deposits) and lending that money \nto other borrowers. The spread between the interest rates paid to depositors and the rates \ncharged to borrowers is the source of the bank\u2019s profit. In this way, lenders and borrowers \ndo not need to contact each other directly. Instead, each goes to the bank, which acts as an \nintermediary between the two. The problem of matching lenders with borrowers is solved \nwhen each comes independently to the common intermediary. \n Financial intermediaries are distinguished from other businesses in that both their \nassets and their liabilities are overwhelmingly financial.  Table\u00a01.3  presents the aggregated \n balance sheet of commercial banks, one of the largest sectors of financial intermediaries. \nNotice that the balance sheet includes only very small amounts of real assets.

In fact, the primary social function of such \nintermediaries is to channel household savings to the business sector.   \n Other examples of financial intermediaries are investment companies, insurance com-\npanies, and credit unions. All these firms offer similar advantages in their intermediary \nrole. First, by pooling the resources of many small investors, they are able to lend con-\nsiderable sums to large borrowers. Second, by lending to many borrowers, intermediaries \nachieve significant diversification, so they can accept loans that individually might be too \nrisky. Third, intermediaries build expertise through the volume of business they do and can \nuse economies of scale and scope to assess and monitor risk. \n  Investment companies  ,   which pool and manage the money of many investors, also \narise out of economies of scale. Here, the problem is that most household portfolios are not \nlarge enough to be spread across a wide variety of securities. In terms of brokerage fees \nand research costs, purchasing one or two shares of many different firms is very expensive. \nMutual funds have the advantage of large-scale trading and portfolio management, while \nparticipating investors are assigned a prorated share of the total funds according to the size \nof their investment. This system gives small investors advantages they are willing to pay \nfor via a management fee to the mutual fund operator. \n Investment companies also can design portfolios specifically for large investors with partic-\nular goals. In contrast, mutual funds are sold in the retail market, and their investment philoso-\nphies are differentiated mainly by strategies that are likely to attract a large number of clients. \n Like mutual funds,  hedge funds   also pool and invest the money of many clients. But \nthey are open only to institutional investors such as pension funds, endowment funds, or \nwealthy individuals. They are more likely to pursue complex and higher-risk strategies. \nThey typically keep a portion of trading profits as part of their fees, whereas mutual funds \ncharge a fixed percentage of assets under management. \n  Assets    $ Billion    % Total    Liabilities and Net Worth    $ Billion    % Total  \nReal assets         Liabilities     \n  Equipment and software  $   4,259  13.9%   Bonds and mortgages  $   5,935  19.4% \n  Real estate  9,051  29.5   Bank loans  612  2.0 \n  Inventories     2,010      6.6    Other loans  1,105  3.6 \nTotal real assets    $15,320  50.0%   Trade debt  1,969  6.4 \n      Other    4,267     13.9   \nFinancial assets Total liabilities  $13,887  45.3% \n  Deposits and cash  $   967  3.2%       \n  Marketable securities  769  2.5       \n  Trade and consumer credit  2,555  8.3       \n  Direct investment abroad  4,055  13.2       \n  Other     6,983     22.8         \n    Total financial assets     $15,329     50.0%      Net worth     $16,762     54.7%  \n     Total   $30,649  100.0%    $30,649  100.0% \nTable 1.4\nBalance sheet of U.S. nonfinancial corporations\n Note: Column sums may differ from total because of rounding error. \nSource:  Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States,   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2012.\nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   13bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   13 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n14 Economies of scale also explain the proliferation of analytic services available to inves-\ntors. Newsletters, databases, and brokerage house research services all engage in research \nto be sold to a large client base. This setup arises naturally. Investors clearly want infor-mation, but with small portfolios to manage, they do not find it economical to personally gather all of it. Hence, a profit opportunity emerges: A firm can perform this service for many clients and charge for it.  \n  Investment Bankers \n Just as economies of scale and specialization create profit opportunities for financial intermediaries, so do these economies create niches for firms that perform specialized services for businesses. Firms raise much of their capital by selling securities such as stocks and bonds to the public. Because these firms do not do so frequently, however,    investment bankers    that specialize in such activities can offer their services at a cost \nbelow that of maintaining an in-house security issuance division. In this role, they are called  underwriters.    \n Investment bankers advise the issuing corporation on the prices it can charge for the \nsecurities issued, appropriate interest rates, and so forth. Ultimately, the investment bank-ing firm handles the marketing of the security in the    primary market    ,  where new issues  Separating Commercial Banking from Investment Banking \n Until 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act had prohibited banks \nin the United States from both accepting deposits and underwriting securities. In other words, it forced a sepa-ration of the investment and commercial banking indus-tries. But when Glass-Steagall was repealed, many large commercial banks began to transform themselves into \u201cuniversal banks\u201d that could offer a full range of com-mercial and investment banking services. In some cases, commercial banks started their own investment banking divisions from scratch, but more frequently they expanded through merger. For example, Chase Manhattan acquired J.P.  Morgan to form JPMorgan Chase. Similarly, Citigroup acquired Salomon Smith Barney to offer wealth manage-ment, brokerage, investment banking, and asset man-agement services to its clients. Most of Europe had never forced the separation of commercial and investment bank-ing, so their giant banks such as Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and UBS had long been universal banks. Until 2008, however, the stand-alone investment banking sector in the U.S. remained large and apparently vibrant, includ-ing such storied names as Goldman Sachs, Morgan-Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. \n But the industry was shaken to its core in 2008, when \nseveral investment banks were beset by enormous losses \non their holdings of mortgage-backed securities. In March, on the verge of insolvency, Bear Stearns was merged into JPMorgan Chase. On September 14, 2008, Merrill Lynch, also suffering steep mortgage-related losses, negotiated an agreement to be acquired by Bank of America. The next day, Lehman Brothers entered into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, having failed to find an acquirer able and willing to rescue it from its steep losses. The next week, the only two remaining major independent investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, decided to convert from investment banks to traditional bank holding com-panies. In doing so, they became subject to the supervision of national bank regulators such as the Federal Reserve and the far tighter rules for capital adequacy that govern commercial banks. The firms decided that the greater sta-bility they would enjoy as commercial banks, particularly the ability to fund their operations through bank deposits and access to emergency borrowing from the Fed, justified the conversion. These mergers and conversions marked the effective end of the independent investment banking industry\u2014but not of investment banking. Those services now will be supplied by the large universal banks. \n Today, the debate about the separation between com-\nmercial and investment banking that seemed to have \nended with the repeal of Glass-Steagall has come back to life. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act places new restrictions on bank activities. For example, the Volcker Rule, named after former chair-man of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker, prohibits banks from \u201cproprietary trading,\u201d that is, trading securities for their own accounts, and restricts their investments in hedge funds or private equity funds. The rule is meant to limit the risk that banks can take on. While the Volcker Rule is far less restrictive than Glass-Steagall had been, they both are motivated by the belief that banks enjoying  Federal guarantees should be subject to limits on the sorts \nof activities in which they can engage. Proprietary trading is a core activity for investment banks, so limitations on this activity for commercial banks would reintroduce a separa-tion between their business models.

Later, investors can trade previously issued securities \namong themselves in the so-called    secondary market    .  \n For most of the last century, investment banks and commercial banks in the U.S. were \nseparated by law. While those regulations were effectively eliminated in 1999, the industry known as \u201cWall Street\u201d was until 2008 still comprised of large, independent investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. But that stand-alone model came to an abrupt end in September 2008, when all the remaining major U.S. invest-ment banks were absorbed into commercial banks, declared bankruptcy, or reorganized as commercial banks. The nearby box presents a brief introduction to these events.  \n  Venture Capital and Private Equity \n While large firms can raise funds directly from the stock and bond markets with help from their investment bankers, smaller and younger firms that have not yet issued securities to the public do not have that option. Start-up companies rely instead on bank loans and investors who are willing to invest in them in return for an ownership stake in the firm. The equity investment in these young companies is called    venture capital (VC)    .  Sources \nof venture capital are dedicated venture capital funds, wealthy individuals known as  angel \ninvestors,  and institutions such as pension funds. \n Most venture capital funds are set up as limited partnerships. A management company \nstarts with its own money and raises additional capital from limited partners such as pen-sion funds. That capital may then be invested in a variety of start-up companies. The man-agement company usually sits on the start-up company\u2019s board of directors, helps recruit senior managers, and provides business advice. It charges a fee to the VC fund for oversee-ing the investments. After some period of time, for example, 10 years, the fund is liqui-dated and proceeds are distributed to the investors. \n Venture capital investors commonly take an active role in the management of a start-up \nfirm. Other active investors may engage in similar hands-on management but focus instead on firms that are in distress or firms that may be bought up, \u201cimproved,\u201d and sold for a profit. Collectively, these investments in firms that do not trade on public stock exchanges are known as    private equity    investments.    \n   1.7 The Financial Crisis of 2008 \n  This chapter has laid out the broad outlines of the financial system, as well as some of the links between the financial side of the economy and the \u201creal\u201d side in which goods and services are produced. The financial crisis of 2008 illustrated in a painful way the intimate ties between these two sectors. We present in this section a capsule summary of the crisis, attempting to draw some lessons about the role of the financial system as well as the causes and consequences of what has become known as  systemic risk.  Some of these issues are \ncomplicated; we consider them briefly here but will return to them in greater detail later in the text once we have more context for analysis.  \n   Antecedents of the Crisis \n In early 2007, most observers thought it inconceivable that within two years, the world financial system would be facing its worst crisis since the Great Depression. At the time, the economy seemed to be marching from strength to strength. The last significant macro-economic threat had been from the implosion of the high-tech bubble in 2000\u20132002. But the Federal Reserve responded to an emerging recession by aggressively reducing interest \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   15bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   15 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 6 PART I  Introduction\nrates.  Figure\u00a01.1  shows that Treasury bill rates dropped drastically between 2001 and 2004, \nand the LIBOR rate, which is the interest rate at which major money-center banks lend to \neach other, fell in tandem.  6   These actions appeared to have been successful, and the reces-\nsion was short-lived and mild.   \n By mid-decade the economy was apparently healthy once again. Although the stock \nmarket had declined substantially between 2001 and 2002,  Figure\u00a0 1.2  shows that it \nreversed direction just as dramatically beginning in 2003, fully recovering all of its post-\ntech-meltdown losses within a few years. Of equal importance, the banking sector seemed \nhealthy. The spread between the LIBOR rate (at which banks borrow from each other) \nand the Treasury-bill rate (at which the U.S. government borrows), a common measure of \ncredit risk in the banking sector (often referred to as the  TED spread    7  ), was only around \n.25% in early 2007 (see the bottom curve in  Figure\u00a01.1 ), suggesting that fears of default or \n\u201ccounterparty\u201d risk in the banking sector were extremely low.  \n Indeed, the apparent success of monetary policy in this recession, as well as in the last \n30 years more generally, had engendered a new term, the \u201cGreat Moderation,\u201d to describe \nthe fact that recent business cycles\u2014and recessions in particular\u2014seemed so mild com-\npared to past experience. Some observers wondered whether we had entered a golden age \nfor macroeconomic policy in which the business cycle had been tamed. \n The combination of dramatically reduced interest rates and an apparently stable econ-\nomy fed a historic boom in the housing market.  Figure\u00a01.3  shows that U.S. housing prices \n Figure 1.1 Short-term LIBOR and Treasury-bill rates and the TED spread          \nPercent\nJan-00\nJul-00\nJan-01\nJul-01\nJan-02\nJul-02\nJan-03\nJul-03\nJan-04\nJul-04\nJan-05\nJul-05\nJan-06\nJul-06\nJan-07\nJul-07\nJan-08\nJul-08\nJan-09\nJul-09\nJan-10\nJul-10\nJan-11\nJul-11\nJan-12\nJul-12012345678\n3-month LIBOR\n3-month T-Bill\nTED spread\n6 LIBOR stands for London Interbank Offer Rate.

On the one hand, the Fed\u2019s policy of \nreducing interest rates had resulted in low yields on a wide variety of investments, and \ninvestors were hungry for higher-yielding alternatives. On the other hand, low volatility \nand growing complacency about risk encouraged greater tolerance for risk in the search \n Figure 1.2 Cumulative returns on the S&P 500 index          \n1980 1983 1986 1989 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007 2010 2013051015Cumulative Value of a $1 Investment2025303540\n Figure 1.3 The Case-Shiller index of U.S. housing prices          \n0\n1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 201350100150200Index (January 2000 = 100)250\nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   17bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   17 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 8 PART I  Introduction\nfor these higher-yielding investments. Nowhere was this more evident than in the explod-\ning market for securitized mortgages. The U.S. housing and mortgage finance markets \nwere at the center of a gathering storm.  \n  Changes in Housing Finance \n Prior to 1970, most mortgage loans would come from a local lender such as a neigh-\nborhood savings bank or credit union. A homeowner would borrow funds for a home \npurchase and repay the loan over a long period, commonly 30 years. A typical thrift insti-\ntution would have as its major asset a portfolio of these long-term home loans, while its \nmajor liability would be the accounts of its depositors. This landscape began to change \nwhen Fannie Mae (FNMA, or Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac \n(FHLMC, or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) began buying mortgage loans \nfrom originators and bundling them into large pools that could be traded like any other \nfinancial asset. These pools, which were essentially claims on the underlying mortgages, \nwere soon dubbed mortgage-backed securities, and the process was called    securitization    .\nFannie and Freddie quickly became the behemoths of the mortgage market, between them \nbuying around half of all mortgages originated by the private sector. \n  Figure\u00a0 1.4  illustrates how cash flows passed from the original borrower to the ulti-\nmate investor in a mortgage-backed security. The loan originator, for example, the savings \nand loan, might make a $100,000 home loan to a homeowner. The homeowner would \nrepay principal and interest (P&I) on the loan over 30 years. But then the originator would \nsell the mortgage to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae and recover the cost of the loan. The \noriginator could continue to service the loan (collect monthly payments from the home-\nowner) for a small servicing fee, but the loan payments net of that fee would be passed \nalong to the agency. In turn, Freddie or Fannie would pool the loans into mortgage-backed \nsecurities and sell the securities to investors such as pension funds or mutual funds. The \nagency (Fannie or Freddie) typically would guarantee the credit or default risk of the loans \nincluded in each pool, for which it would retain a guarantee fee before passing along the \nrest of the cash flow to the ultimate investor. Because the mortgage cash flows were passed \nalong from the homeowner to the lender to Fannie or Freddie to the investor, the mortgage-\nbacked securities were also called  pass-throughs.    \n Until the last decade, the vast majority of securitized mortgages were held or guaran-\nteed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. These were low-risk  conforming   mortgages, meaning \nthat eligible loans for agency securitization couldn\u2019t be too big, and homeowners had to \nmeet underwriting criteria establishing their ability to repay the loan. For example, the \nratio of loan amount to house value could be no more than 80%. But securitization gave \nrise to a new market niche for mortgage lenders: the \u201coriginate to distribute\u201d (versus origi-\nnate to hold) business model. \n Figure 1.4 Cash flows in a mortgage pass-through security  \n$100 K\nP&IP&I \u2013 servicing \u2013\nguarantee fee$100 K $100 K\nOriginator Homeowner\nP&I \u2013\nservicing feeInvestor Agency\nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   18bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   18 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 1 The Investment Environment 19\n Whereas conforming loans were pooled almost entirely through Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae, once the securitization model took hold, it created an opening for a new \n product: securitization by private firms of  nonconforming  \u201csubprime\u201d loans with higher \ndefault risk. One important difference between the government agency pass-throughs and these so-called private-label pass-throughs was that the investor in the private-label pool would bear the risk that homeowners might default on their loans. Thus, originating mortgage brokers had little incentive to perform due diligence on the loan  as long as the \nloans could be sold to an investor.  These investors, of course, had no direct contact with the borrowers, and they could not perform detailed underwriting concerning loan quality. Instead, they relied on borrowers\u2019 credit scores, which steadily came to replace conven-tional underwriting. \n A strong trend toward low-documentation and then no-documentation loans, entailing \nlittle verification of a borrower\u2019s ability to carry a loan, soon emerged. Other subprime underwriting standards quickly deteriorated. For example, allowed leverage on home loans (as measured by the loan-to-value ratio) rose dramatically. By 2006, the majority of subprime borrowers purchased houses by borrowing the  entire  purchase price! When \nhousing prices began falling, these loans were quickly \u201cunderwater,\u201d meaning that the house was worth less than the loan balance, and many homeowners decided to walk away from their loans. \n Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) also grew in popularity. These loans offered bor-\nrowers low initial or \u201cteaser\u201d interest rates, but these rates eventually would reset to current market interest yields, for example, the Treasury bill rate plus 3%. Many of these borrow-ers \u201cmaxed out\u201d their borrowing capacity at the teaser rate, yet, as soon as the loan rate was reset, their monthly payments would soar, especially if market interest rates had increased. \n Despite these obvious risks, the ongoing increase in housing prices over the last \ndecade seemed to lull many investors into complacency, with a widespread belief that continually rising home prices would bail out poorly performing loans. But starting in 2004, the ability of refinancing to save a loan began to diminish. First, higher interest rates put payment pressure on homeowners who had taken out adjustable-rate mortgages. Second, as  Figure\u00a01.3  shows, housing prices peaked by 2006, so homeowners\u2019 ability to refinance a loan using built-up equity in the house declined. Housing default rates began to surge in 2007, as did losses on mortgage-backed securities. The crisis was ready to shift into high gear.  \n  Mortgage Derivatives \n One might ask: Who was willing to buy all of these risky subprime mortgages? Secu-ritization, restructuring, and credit enhancement provide a big part of the answer. New  risk-shifting tools enabled investment banks to carve out AAA-rated securities from  original-issue \u201cjunk\u201d loans. Collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, were among the most important and eventually damaging of these innovations. \n CDOs were designed to concentrate the credit (i.e., default) risk of a bundle of loans on \none class of investors, leaving the other investors in the pool relatively protected from that risk. The idea was to prioritize claims on loan repayments by dividing the pool into senior versus junior slices, called  tranches.  The senior tranches had first claim on repayments \nfrom the entire pool. Junior tranches would be paid only after the senior ones had received their cut.  \n8   For example, if a pool were divided into two tranches, with 70% of the pool \nallocated to the senior tranche and 30% allocated to the junior one, the senior investors \n  8 CDOs and related securities are sometimes called  structured products.  \u201cStructured\u201d means that original cash \nflows are sliced up and reapportioned across tranches according to some stipulated rule. \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   19bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   19 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2 0  PART I  Introduction\nwould be repaid in full as long as 70% or more of the loans in the pool performed, that is, \nas long as the default rate on the pool remained below 30%. Even with pools composed of risky subprime loans, default rates above 30% seemed extremely unlikely, and thus senior tranches were frequently granted the highest (i.e., AAA) rating by the major credit rating agencies, Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s, and Fitch. Large amounts of AAA-rated securities were thus carved out of pools of low-rated mortgages. (We will describe CDOs in more detail in Chapter 14.)  \n Of course, we know now that these ratings were wrong. The senior-subordinated \nstructure of CDOs provided far less protection to senior tranches than investors antici-pated. When housing prices across the entire country began to fall in unison, defaults in all regions increased, and the hoped-for benefits from spreading the risks geographically never materialized. \n Why had the rating agencies so dramatically underestimated credit risk in these sub-\nprime securities? First, default probabilities had been estimated using historical data from an unrepresentative period characterized by a housing boom and an uncommonly prosper-ous and recession-free macroeconomy. Moreover, the ratings analysts had extrapolated historical default experience to a new sort of borrower pool\u2014one without down payments, with exploding-payment loans, and with low- or no-documentation loans (often called  liar \nloans ). Past default experience was largely irrelevant given these profound changes in the market. Moreover, the power of cross-regional diversification to minimize risk engendered excessive optimism. \n Finally, agency problems became apparent. The ratings agencies were paid to provide \nratings by the issuers of the securities\u2014not the purchasers. They faced pressure from the issuers, who could shop around for the most favorable treatment, to provide generous ratings.   \n When Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pooled mortgages into securities, they guaranteed the underlying \nmortgage loans against homeowner defaults. In contrast, there were no guarantees on the mortgages pooled into subprime mortgage-backed securities, so investors would bear credit risk. Was either of these arrangements necessarily a better way to manage and allocate default risk?  CONCEPT CHECK 1.2 \n  Credit Default Swaps \n In parallel to the CDO market, the market in  credit default swaps  also exploded in this \nperiod. A credit default swap, or CDS, is in essence an insurance contract against the \ndefault of one or more borrowers. (We will describe these in more detail in Chapter 14.) The purchaser of the swap pays an annual premium (like an insurance premium) for protec-tion from credit risk. Credit default swaps became an alternative method of credit enhance-ment, seemingly allowing investors to buy subprime loans and insure their safety. But in practice, some swap issuers ramped up their exposure to credit risk to unsupportable lev-els, without sufficient capital to back those obligations. For example, the large insurance company AIG alone sold more than $400 billion of CDS contracts on subprime mortgages.  \n  The Rise of Systemic Risk \n By 2007, the financial system displayed several troubling features. Many large banks and related financial institutions had adopted an apparently profitable financing scheme: bor-rowing short term at low interest rates to finance holdings in higher-yielding, long-term \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   20bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   20 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 1 The Investment Environment 21\nilliquid assets,  9   and treating the interest rate differential between their assets and liabilities \nas economic profit. But this business model was precarious: By relying primarily on short-\nterm loans for their funding, these firms needed to constantly refinance their positions (i.e., borrow additional funds as the loans matured), or else face the necessity of quickly selling off their less-liquid asset portfolios, which would be difficult in times of financial stress. Moreover, these institutions were highly leveraged and had little capital as a buffer against losses. Large investment banks on Wall Street in particular had sharply increased leverage, which added to an underappreciated vulnerability to refunding requirements\u2014especially if the value of their asset portfolios came into question. Even small portfolio losses could drive their net worth negative, at which point no one would be willing to renew outstanding loans or extend new ones.  \n Another source of fragility was widespread investor reliance on \u201ccredit enhancement\u201d \nthrough products like CDOs. Many of the assets underlying these pools were illiquid, hard to value, and highly dependent on forecasts of future performance of other loans. In a widespread downturn, with rating downgrades, these assets would prove difficult to sell. \n The steady displacement of formal exchange trading by informal \u201cover-the-counter\u201d \nmarkets created other problems. In formal exchanges such as futures or options markets, participants must put up collateral called  margin  to guarantee their ability to make good on \ntheir obligations. Prices are computed each day, and gains or losses are continually added to or subtracted from each trader\u2019s margin account. If a margin account runs low after a series of losses, the investor can be required to either contribute more collateral or to close out the position before actual insolvency ensues. Positions, and thus exposures to losses, are transparent to other traders. In contrast, the over-the-counter markets where CDS con-tracts trade are effectively private contracts between two parties with less public disclosure of positions, less standardization of products (which makes the fair value of a contract hard to discover), and consequently less opportunity to recognize either cumulative gains or losses over time or the resultant credit exposure of each trading partner. \n This new financial model was brimming with    systemic risk    ,  a potential breakdown \nof the financial system when problems in one market spill over and disrupt others. When lenders such as banks have limited capital and are afraid of further losses, they may ratio-nally choose to hoard their capital instead of lending it to customers such as small firms, thereby exacerbating funding problems for their customary borrowers.  \n  The Shoe Drops \n By fall 2007, housing price declines were widespread ( Figure\u00a01.3 ), mortgage delinquen-cies increased, and the stock market entered its own free fall ( Figure\u00a01.2 ). Many investment banks, which had large investments in mortgages, also began to totter. \n The crisis peaked in September 2008. On September 7, the giant federal mortgage agen-\ncies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which had taken large positions in subprime mortgage\u2013backed securities, were put into conservatorship. (We will have more to say on their travails in Chapter 2.) The failure of these two mainstays of the U.S. housing and mortgage finance industries threw financial markets into a panic. By the second week of September, it was clear that both Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch were on the verge of bankruptcy. On September 14, Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America, again with the benefit of government brokering and protection against losses. The next day, Lehman Brothers, which was denied equivalent treatment, filed for bankruptcy protection. Two \n  9  Liquidity  refers to the speed and the ease with which investors can realize the cash value of an investment. Illiq-\nuid assets, for example, real estate, can be hard to sell quickly, and a quick sale may require a substantial discount \nfrom the price at which the asset could be sold in an unrushed situation. \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   21bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   21 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2 2  PART I  Introduction\ndays later, on September 17, the government reluctantly lent $85 billion to AIG, reasoning \nthat its failure would have been highly destabilizing to the banking industry, which was holding massive amounts of its credit guarantees (i.e., CDS contacts). The next day, the Treasury unveiled its first proposal to spend $700 billion to purchase \u201ctoxic\u201d mortgage-backed securities. \n A particularly devastating fallout of the Lehman bankruptcy was on the \u201cmoney mar-\nket\u201d for short-term lending. Lehman had borrowed considerable funds by issuing very short-term debt, called commercial paper. Among the major customers in commercial paper were money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, high-quality debt of commercial borrowers. When Lehman faltered, the Reserve Primary Money Market Fund, which was holding large amounts of (AAA-rated!) Lehman commercial paper, suffered investment losses that drove the value of its assets below $1 per share.  \n10   Fears spread that \nother funds were similarly exposed, and money market fund customers across the country rushed to withdraw their funds. The funds in turn rushed out of commercial paper into safer and more liquid Treasury bills, essentially shutting down short-term financing markets.  \n The freezing up of credit markets was the end of any dwindling possibility that the finan-\ncial crisis could be contained to Wall Street. Larger companies that had relied on the com-mercial paper market were now unable to raise short-term funds. Banks similarly found it difficult to raise funds. (Look back to  Figure\u00a01.1 , where you will see that the TED spread, a measure of bank insolvency fears, skyrocketed in 2008.) With banks unwilling or unable to extend credit to their customers, thousands of small businesses that relied on bank lines of credit also became unable to finance their normal business operations. Capital-starved companies were forced to scale back their own operations precipitously. The unemploy-ment rate rose rapidly, and the economy was in its worst recession in decades. The turmoil in the financial markets had spilled over into the real economy, and Main Street had joined Wall Street in a bout of protracted misery.  \n  The Dodd-Frank Reform Act \n The crisis engendered many calls for reform of Wall Street. These eventually led to the passage in 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which proposes several mechanisms to mitigate systemic risk. \n The act calls for stricter rules for bank capital, liquidity, and risk management practices, \nespecially as banks become larger and their potential failure would be more threatening to other institutions. With more capital supporting banks, the potential for one insolvency to trigger another could be contained. In addition, when banks have more capital, they have less incentive to ramp up risk, as potential losses will come at their own expense and not the FDIC\u2019s. \n Dodd-Frank also mandates increased transparency, especially in derivatives markets. \nFor example, one suggestion is to standardize CDS contracts so they can trade in central-ized exchanges where prices can be determined in a deep market and gains or losses can be settled on a daily basis. Margin requirements, enforced daily, would prevent CDS partici-pants from taking on greater positions than they can handle, and exchange trading would facilitate analysis of the exposure of firms to losses in these markets. \n The act also attempts to limit the risky activities in which banks can engage. The so-\ncalled V olcker Rule, named after former chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul V olcker, \n  10 Money market funds typically bear very little investment risk and can maintain their asset values at $1 per share. \nInvestors view them as near substitutes for checking accounts. Until this episode, no other retail fund had \u201cbroken \nthe buck.\u201d \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   22bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   22 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 1 The Investment Environment 23\nprohibits banks from trading for their own accounts and limits total investments in hedge \nfunds or private equity funds. \n The law also addresses shortcomings of the regulatory system that became apparent in \n2008. The U.S. has several financial regulators with overlapping responsibility, and some institutions were accused of \u201cregulator shopping,\u201d seeking to be supervised by the most lenient regulator. Dodd-Frank seeks to unify and clarify lines of regulatory authority and responsibility in one or a smaller number of government agencies. \n The act addresses incentive issues. Among these are proposals to force employee com-\npensation to reflect longer-term performance. The act requires public companies to set \u201cclaw-back provisions\u201d to take back executive compensation if it was based on inaccu-rate financial statements. The motivation is to discourage excessive risk-taking by large financial institutions in which big bets can be wagered with the attitude that a successful outcome will result in a big bonus while a bad outcome will be borne by the company, or worse, the taxpayer. \n The incentives of the bond rating agencies are also a sore point. Few are happy with a \nsystem that has the ratings agencies paid by the firms they rate. The act creates an Office of Credit Ratings within the Securities and Exchange Commission to oversee the credit rating agencies. \n It is still too early to know which, if any, of these reforms will stick. The implementa-\ntion of Dodd-Frank is still subject to considerable interpretation by regulators, and the act is still under attack by some members of Congress. But the crisis surely has made clear the essential role of the financial system in the functioning of the real economy.    \n   1.8 Outline of the Text \n  The text has seven parts, which are fairly independent and may be studied in a variety of sequences. Part One is an introduction to financial markets, instruments, and trading of securities. This part also describes the mutual fund industry. \n Parts Two and Three contain the core of what has come to be known as \u201cmodern port-\nfolio theory.\u201d We start in Part Two with a general discussion of risk and return and the les-sons of capital market history. We then focus more closely on how to describe investors\u2019 risk preferences and progress to asset allocation, efficient diversification, and portfolio optimization. \n In Part Three, we investigate the implications of portfolio theory for the equilibrium \nrelationship between risk and return. We introduce the capital asset pricing model, its implementation using index models, and more advanced models of risk and return. This part also treats the efficient market hypothesis as well as behavioral critiques of theories based on investor rationality and closes with a chapter on empirical evidence concerning security returns. \n Parts Four through Six cover security analysis and valuation. Part Four is devoted to \ndebt markets and Part Five to equity markets. Part Six covers derivative assets, such as options and futures contracts. \n Part Seven is an introduction to active investment management. It shows how different \ninvestors\u2019 objectives and constraints can lead to a variety of investment policies. This part discusses the role of active management in nearly efficient markets and considers how one should evaluate the performance of managers who pursue active strategies. It also shows how the principles of portfolio construction can be extended to the international setting and examines the hedge fund industry.    \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   23bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   23 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm2 4  PART I  Introduction\n     1 .   Real assets create wealth. Financial assets represent claims to parts or all of that wealth. Financial \nassets determine how the ownership of real assets is distributed among investors.  \n    2 .   Financial assets can be categorized as fixed income, equity, or derivative instruments. Top-down portfolio construction techniques start with the asset allocation decision\u2014the alloca-tion of funds across broad asset classes\u2014and then progress to more specific security-selection decisions.  \n    3 .   Competition in financial markets leads to a risk\u2013return trade-off, in which securities that offer higher expected rates of return also impose greater risks on investors. The presence of risk, how-ever, implies that actual returns can differ considerably from expected returns at the beginning of the investment period. Competition among security analysts also promotes financial markets that are nearly informationally efficient, meaning that prices reflect all available information concern-ing the value of the security. Passive investment strategies may make sense in nearly efficient markets.  \n    4 .   Financial intermediaries pool investor funds and invest them. Their services are in demand because small investors cannot efficiently gather information, diversify, and monitor portfolios. The financial intermediary sells its own securities to the small investors. The intermediary invests the funds thus raised, uses the proceeds to pay back the small investors, and profits from the  difference (the spread).  \n    5 .   Investment banking brings efficiency to corporate fund-raising. Investment bankers develop expertise in pricing new issues and in marketing them to investors. By the end of 2008, all the major stand-alone U.S. investment banks had been absorbed into commercial banks or had reor-ganized themselves into bank holding companies. In Europe, where universal banking had never been prohibited, large banks had long maintained both commercial and investment banking divisions.  \n    6 .   The financial crisis of 2008 showed the importance of systemic risk. Systemic risk can be limited by transparency that allows traders and investors to assess the risk of their counterparties, capital requirements to prevent trading participants from being brought down by potential losses, fre-quent settlement of gains or losses to prevent losses from accumulating beyond an institution\u2019s ability to bear them, incentives to discourage excessive risk taking, and accurate and unbiased analysis by those charged with evaluating security risk.

The central issue is the incentive to monitor the quality of loans when originated as well as \nover time. Freddie and Fannie clearly had incentive to monitor the quality of conforming loans \nthat they had guaranteed, and their ongoing relationships with mortgage originators gave them opportunities to evaluate track records over extended periods of time. In the subprime mortgage market, the ultimate investors in the securities (or the CDOs backed by those securities), who were bearing the credit risk, should not have been willing to invest in loans with a disproportionate likelihood of default. If they properly understood their exposure to default risk, then the (correspondingly low) prices they would have been willing to pay for these securities would have imposed discipline on the mortgage originators and servicers. The fact that they were willing to hold such large positions in these risky securities suggests that they did not appreciate the extent of their exposure. Maybe they were led astray by overly optimistic projections for housing prices or by biased assessments from the credit-reporting agencies. In principle, either arrangement for default risk could have provided the appropriate discipline on the mortgage originators; in practice, however, the informational advantages of Freddie and Fannie probably made them the better \u201crecipients\u201d of default risk. The lesson is that information and transparency are some of the preconditions for well-functioning markets.        \nbod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   27bod61671_ch01_001-027.indd   27 6/18/13   7:35 PM6/18/13   7:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2\n  YOU LEARNED IN\u00a0 Chapter 1 that the pro-\ncess of building an investment portfolio usu-\nally begins by deciding how much money to allocate to broad classes of assets, such as safe money market securities or bank accounts, longer term bonds, stocks, or even asset classes like real estate or precious metals. This process is called  asset allocation.  Within each \nclass the investor then selects specific assets from a more detailed menu. This is called  security selection.  \n Each broad asset class contains many spe-\ncific security types, and the many variations \non a theme can be overwhelming. Our goal in this chapter is to introduce you to the important features of broad classes of securi-ties. Toward this end, we organize our tour of financial instruments according to asset class. \n Financial markets are traditionally seg-\nmented into   money markets   and   capital markets  . Money market instruments include \nshort-term, marketable, liquid, low-risk debt \nsecurities. Money market instruments some-times are called  cash equivalents,  or just  cash\nfor short. Capital markets, in contrast, include longer term and riskier securities. Securities in the capital market are much more diverse than those found within the money market. For this reason, we will subdivide the capital market into four segments: longer term bond markets, equity markets, and the derivative markets for options and futures. \n We first describe money market instru-\nments. We then move on to debt and equity \nsecurities. We explain the structure of various stock market indexes in this chapter because market benchmark portfolios play an impor-tant role in portfolio construction and evalua-tion. Finally, we survey the derivative security markets for options and futures contracts.

It consists of very short-\nterm debt securities that usually are highly marketable.  Table\u00a02.1  lists outstanding volume \nin 2012 for some of the major instruments in this market. Many of these securities trade \nin large denominations, and so are out of the reach of individual investors. Money mar-\nket funds, however, are easily accessible to small investors. These mutual funds pool the \nresources of many investors and purchase a wide variety of money market securities on \ntheir behalf.   \n   Treasury Bills \n U.S.  Treasury bills   (T-bills, or just bills, for short) are the most marketable of all money \nmarket instruments. T-bills represent the simplest form of borrowing: The government \nraises money by selling bills to the public. Investors buy the bills at a discount from the \nstated maturity value. At the bill\u2019s maturity, the holder receives from the government a \npayment equal to the face value of the bill. The difference between the purchase price and \nultimate maturity value constitutes the investor\u2019s earnings. \n T-bills are issued with initial maturities of 4, 13, 26, or 52 weeks. Individuals can pur-\nchase T-bills directly, at auction, or on the secondary market from a government securi-\nties dealer. T-bills are highly liquid; that is, they are easily converted to cash and sold \nat low transaction cost and with not much price risk. Unlike most other money market \ninstruments, which sell in minimum denominations of $100,000, T-bills sell in minimum \ndenominations of only $100, although $10,000 denominations are far more common. The \nincome earned on T-bills is exempt from all state and local taxes, another characteristic \ndistinguishing them from other money market instruments. \n  Figure\u00a02.1  is a partial listing of T-bill rates. Rather than providing prices of each bill, \nthe financial press reports yields based on those prices. You will see yields corresponding \nto both bid and ask prices. The    ask price    is the price you would have to pay to buy a T-bill \nfrom a securities dealer. The    bid price    is the slightly lower price you would receive if you \nwanted to sell a bill to a dealer. The    bid\u2013ask spread    is the difference in these prices, which \nis the dealer\u2019s source of profit. (Notice in  Figure\u00a02.1  that the bid  yield   is higher than the ask \nyield.

For example, for the highlighted bill maturing on \nDecember 20, 2012, days to maturity are 156 and the yield \nunder the column labeled \u201cASKED\u201d is given as .125%. This \nmeans that a dealer was willing to sell the bill at a discount \nfrom face value of .125%\u00a0 3 \u00a0(156/360)\u00a0 5 \u00a0.0542%. So a bill \nwith $10,000 face value could be purchased for $10,000\u00a0 3\n(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.000542)\u00a0 5 \u00a0$9,994.58. Similarly, on the basis of the \nbid yield of .130%, a dealer would be willing to purchase the \nbill for $10,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.00130\u00a0 3 \u00a0156/360)\u00a0 5 \u00a0$9,994.367. \n The bank discount method for computing yields has a \nlong tradition, but it is flawed for at least two reasons. First, \nit assumes that the year has only 360 days. Second, it com-\nputes the yield as a fraction of par value rather than of the \nprice the investor paid to acquire the bill.  1   An investor who buys the bill for the ask price \nand holds it until maturity will see her investment grow over 156 days by a multiple of \n$10,000/$9,994.58\u00a0 5 \u00a01.000542, for a gain of .0542%. Annualizing this gain using a 365-day \nyear results in a yield of .0542%\u00a0 3 \u00a0365/156\u00a0 5 \u00a0.127%, which is the value reported in the last \ncolumn under \u201cASK YLD.\u201d This last value is called the Treasury-bill\u2019s  bond-equivalent yield.      \n  Certificates of Deposit \n A    certificate of deposit,      or CD, is a time deposit with a bank. Time deposits may not be \nwithdrawn on demand. The bank pays interest and principal to the depositor only at the \nend of the fixed term of the CD. CDs issued in denominations greater than $100,000 \nare usually negotiable, however; that is, they can be sold to another investor if the owner \nneeds to cash in the certificate before its maturity date. Short-term CDs are highly market-\nable, although the market significantly thins out for maturities of 3 months or more. CDs \nare treated as bank deposits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, so they are cur-\nrently insured for up to $250,000 in the event of a bank insolvency.  \n  Commercial Paper \n Large, well-known companies often issue their own short-term unsecured debt notes rather \nthan borrow directly from banks. These notes are called    commercial paper.      Very often, \ncommercial paper is backed by a bank line of credit, which gives the borrower access to \ncash that can be used (if needed) to pay off the paper at maturity. \n Commercial paper maturities range up to 270 days; longer maturities would require \nregistration with the Securities and Exchange Commission and so are almost never issued. \nMost often, commercial paper is issued with maturities of less than 1 or 2 months. Usually, \nit is issued in multiples of $100,000. Therefore, small investors can invest in commercial \npaper only indirectly, via money market mutual funds. \n Commercial paper is considered to be a fairly safe asset, because a firm\u2019s condition \npresumably can be monitored and predicted over a term as short as 1 month. \n1 Both of these \u201cerrors\u201d were dictated by computational simplicity in precomputer days. It is easier to compute \npercentage discounts from a round number such as par value rather than purchase price. It is also easier to annual-\nize using a 360-day year, because 360 is an even multiple of so many numbers.Sep  06  12 51 0.080 0.075 0.000 0.076\nOct    04  12 79 0.085 0.080 0.000 0.081\nNov   01  12 107 0.110 0.100 0.005 0.101\nNov   29  12 135 0.110 0.105 0.000 0.106\nDec   20  12 156 0.130 0.125 0.005 0.127\nApr  04  13 261 0.160 0.150 0.005 0.152BID MATURITYDAYS TO\nMAT ASKEDASK\nYLD CHGTreasury Bills\n Figure 2.1 Treasury bill yields \n  Source: Compiled from data obtained from  The Wall \nStreet Journal Online,   July 17, 2012. \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   30bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   30 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 2 Asset Classes and Financial Instruments 31\n While most commercial paper is issued by nonfinancial firms, in recent years there was \na sharp increase in  asset-backed commercial paper  issued by financial firms such as banks. \nThis was short-term commercial paper typically used to raise funds for the institution to \ninvest in other assets, most notoriously, subprime mortgages. These assets were in turn used as collateral for the commercial paper\u2014hence the label \u201casset backed.\u201d This practice led to many difficulties starting in the summer of 2007 when the subprime mortgagors began defaulting. The banks found themselves unable to issue new commercial paper to refinance their positions as the old paper matured.  \n  Bankers\u2019 Acceptances \n A    banker\u2019s acceptance    starts as an order to a bank by a bank\u2019s customer to pay a sum of money at a future date, typically within 6 months. At this stage, it is similar to a postdated check. When the bank endorses the order for payment as \u201caccepted,\u201d it assumes respon-sibility for ultimate payment to the holder of the acceptance. At this point, the acceptance may be traded in secondary markets like any other claim on the bank. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are considered very safe assets because traders can substitute the bank\u2019s credit standing for their own. They are used widely in foreign trade where the creditworthiness of one trader is unknown to the trading partner. Acceptances sell at a discount from the face value of the payment order, just as T-bills sell at a discount from par value.  \n  Eurodollars \n    Eurodollars    are dollar-denominated deposits at foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks. By locating outside the United States, these banks escape regulation by the Federal Reserve. Despite the tag \u201cEuro,\u201d these accounts need not be in European banks, although that is where the practice of accepting dollar-denominated deposits outside the United States began. \n Most Eurodollar deposits are for large sums, and most are time deposits of less than \n6 months\u2019 maturity. A variation on the Eurodollar time deposit is the Eurodollar certifi-cate of deposit, which resembles a domestic bank CD except that it is the liability of a non-U.S. branch of a bank, typically a London branch. The advantage of Eurodollar CDs over Eurodollar time deposits is that the holder can sell the asset to realize its cash value before maturity. Eurodollar CDs are considered less liquid and riskier than domestic CDs, however, and thus offer higher yields. Firms also issue Eurodollar bonds, which are dollar-denominated bonds outside the U.S., although bonds are not a money market investment because of their long maturities.  \n  Repos and Reverses \n Dealers in government securities use    repurchase agreements,      also called \u201crepos\u201d or \n\u201cRPs,\u201d as a form of short-term, usually overnight, borrowing. The dealer sells govern-ment securities to an investor on an overnight basis, with an agreement to buy back those securities the next day at a slightly higher price. The increase in the price is the overnight interest. The dealer thus takes out a 1-day loan from the investor, and the securities serve as collateral. \n A  term repo  is essentially an identical transaction, except that the term of the implicit \nloan can be 30 days or more. Repos are considered very safe in terms of credit risk because the loans are backed by the government securities. A  reverse repo  is the mirror image of \na repo. Here, the dealer finds an investor holding government securities and buys them, agreeing to sell them back at a specified higher price on a future date.  \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   31bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   31 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n3 2  PART I  Introduction\n  Federal Funds \n Just as most of us maintain deposits at banks, banks maintain deposits of their own at \na Federal Reserve bank. Each member bank of the Federal Reserve System, or \u201cthe Fed,\u201d is required to maintain a minimum balance in a reserve account with the Fed. The required balance depends on the total deposits of the bank\u2019s customers. Funds in the bank\u2019s reserve account are called    federal funds,      o r   fed funds.  At any time, some \nbanks have more funds than required at the Fed. Other banks, primarily big banks in New York and other financial centers, tend to have a shortage of federal funds. In the federal funds market, banks with excess funds lend to those with a shortage. These loans, which are usually overnight transactions, are arranged at a rate of interest called the  federal funds rate.   \n Although the fed funds market arose primarily as a way for banks to transfer balances \nto meet reserve requirements, today the market has evolved to the point that many large banks use federal funds in a straightforward way as one component of their total sources of funding. Therefore, the fed funds rate is simply the rate of interest on very short-term loans among financial institutions. While most investors cannot participate in this market, the fed funds rate commands great interest as a key barometer of monetary policy.  \n  Brokers\u2019 Calls \n Individuals who buy stocks on margin borrow part of the funds to pay for the stocks from their broker. The broker in turn may borrow the funds from a bank, agreeing to repay the bank immediately (on call) if the bank requests it. The rate paid on such loans is usually about 1% higher than the rate on short-term T-bills.  \n  The LIBOR Market \n The    London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)    is the rate at which large banks in \nLondon are willing to lend money among themselves. This rate, which is quoted on dollar-denominated loans, has become the premier short-term interest rate quoted in the European money market, and it serves as a reference rate for a wide range of transactions. For exam-ple, a corporation might borrow at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 2%. \n LIBOR interest rates may be tied to currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For example, \nLIBOR rates are widely quoted for transactions denominated in British pounds, yen, euros, and so on. There is also a similar rate called EURIBOR (European Interbank Offered Rate) at which banks in the euro zone are willing to lend euros among themselves. \n LIBOR is a key reference rate in the money market, and many trillions of dollars of \nloans and derivative assets are tied to it. Therefore, the 2012 scandal involving the fixing of LIBOR deeply shook these markets. The nearby box discusses those events.   \n  Yields on Money Market Instruments \n Although most money market securities are of low risk, they are not risk-free. The secu-rities of the money market promise yields greater than those on default-free T-bills, at least in part because of greater relative riskiness. In addition, many investors require more liquidity; thus they will accept lower yields on securities such as T-bills that can be quickly and cheaply sold for cash.  Figure\u00a02.2  shows that bank CDs, for example, consistently have paid a premium over T-bills. Moreover, that premium increased with economic crises such as the energy price shocks associated with the two OPEC disturbances, the failure of Penn Square bank, the stock market crash in 1987, the collapse of Long Term Capital Manage-ment in 1998, and the credit crisis beginning with the breakdown of the market in subprime mortgages beginning in 2007. If you look back to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1, you\u2019ll see that \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   32bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   32 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n33  The LIBOR Scandals \n LIBOR was designed initially as a survey of interbank lend-\ning rates but soon became a key determinant of short-\nterm interest rates with far-reaching significance. Around \n$350 trillion of derivative contracts have payoffs tied to \nit, and perhaps another $400 trillion of loans and bonds \nwith floating interest rates linked to LIBOR are currently \noutstanding. LIBOR is quoted for loans in several curren-\ncies, e.g., the dollar, yen, euro, and British pound, and for \nmaturities ranging from a day to a year, although 3 months \nis the most common. \n However, LIBOR is not a rate at which actual transac-\ntions occur; instead, it is just a survey of \u201cestimated\u201d bor-\nrowing rates, and this has made it vulnerable to tampering. \nSeveral large banks are asked to report the rate at which \nthey  believe   they can borrow in the interbank market. Out-\nliers are trimmed from the sample of responses, and LIBOR \nis calculated as the average of the mid-range estimates. \n Over time, several problems surfaced. First, it appeared \nthat banks understated the rates at which they claimed \nthey could borrow in an effort to make themselves look \nfinancially stronger. Other surveys that asked for estimates \nof the rates at which  other   banks could borrow resulted \nin higher values. Moreover, LIBOR did not seem to reflect \ncurrent market conditions. A majority of LIBOR submissions \nwere unchanged from day to day even when other interest \nrates fluctuated, and LIBOR spreads showed surprisingly low correlation with other measures of credit risk such \nas spreads on credit default swaps. Even worse, once the \nmarket came under scrutiny, it emerged that participating \nbanks were colluding to manipulate their LIBOR submis-\nsions to enhance profits on their derivatives trades. Trad-\ners used e-mails and instant messages to tell each other \nwhether they wanted to see higher or lower submissions. \nMembers of this informal cartel essentially set up a \u201cfavor \nbank\u201d to help each other move the survey average up or \ndown depending on their trading positions. \n To date, around $2.5 billion of fines have been paid: \nRoyal Bank of Scotland paid $612 million, Barclays $450 \nmillion, and UBS $1,500 million. Other banks remain under \ninvestigation. But government fines may be only the tip \nof the iceberg. Private lawsuits are sure to come, as anyone \ntrading a LIBOR derivative against these banks or anyone \nwho participated in a loan with an interest rate tied to \nLIBOR can claim to have been harmed. \n Several reforms have been suggested. The British Bankers \nAssociation, which until recently ran the LIBOR survey, yielded \nresponsibility for LIBOR to British regulators. Other proposals \nare to increase the number of submissions to make collusion \nmore difficult and to eliminate LIBOR in less active currencies \nand maturities where collusion is easier. More substantive \nproposals would replace the survey rate with one based on \nactual, verifiable, transactions\u2014i.e., real loans among banks.

This market includes Treasury notes and bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, mortgage securities, and federal agency debt. \n These instruments are sometimes said to comprise the  fixed-income capital market,  \nbecause most of them promise either a fixed stream of income or a stream of income that is determined according to a specific formula. In practice, these formulas can result in a flow of income that is far from fixed. Therefore, the term  fixed income  is probably not \nfully appropriate. It is simpler and more straightforward to call these securities either debt instruments or bonds.  \n   Treasury Notes and Bonds \n The U.S. government borrows funds in large part by selling    Treasury notes    and \n   Treasury bonds  .    T-notes are issued with maturities ranging up to 10 years, while bonds \nare issued with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. Both notes and bonds may be    2.2 The Bond Market   Money Market Funds and the Credit Crisis of 2008 \n Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in the \nshort-term debt instruments that comprise the money mar-ket. In 2013, these funds had investments totaling about $2.6 trillion. They are required to hold only short-maturity debt of the highest quality: The average maturity of their holdings must be maintained at less than 3 months. Their biggest investments tend to be in commercial paper, but they also hold sizable fractions of their portfolios in cer-tificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, and Treasury securities. Because of this very conservative investment profile, money market funds typically experience extremely low price risk. Investors for their part usually acquire check-writing privileges with their funds and often use them as a close substitute for a bank account. This is feasible because the funds almost always maintain share value at $1.00 and pass along all investment earnings to their investors as interest. \n Until 2008, only one fund had \u201cbroken the buck,\u201d that \nis, suffered losses large enough to force value per share \nbelow $1. But when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008, several funds that had invested heavily in its commercial paper suffered large losses. The next day, the Reserve Primary Fund, the oldest money market fund, broke the buck when its value per share fell to only $.97. \n The realization that money market funds were at risk in \nthe credit crisis led to a wave of investor redemptions similar \nto a run on a bank. Only three days after the Lehman bank-ruptcy, Putman\u2019s Prime Money Market Fund announced that it was liquidating due to heavy redemptions. Fear-ing further outflows, the U.S. Treasury announced that it would make federal insurance available to money market funds willing to pay an insurance fee. This program would thus be similar to FDIC bank insurance. With the federal insurance in place, the outflows were quelled. \n However, the turmoil in Wall Street\u2019s money market \nfunds had already spilled over into \u201cMain Street.\u201d Fearing \nfurther investor redemptions, money market funds had become afraid to commit funds even over short periods, and their demand for commercial paper had effectively dried up. Firms throughout the economy had come to depend on those markets as a major source of short-term finance to fund expenditures ranging from salaries to inventories. Further breakdown in the money markets would have had an immediate crippling effect on the broad economy. To end the panic and stabilize the money mar-kets, the federal government decided to guarantee invest-ments in money market funds. The guarantee did in fact calm investors and end the run, but it put the government on the hook for a potential liability of up to $3 trillion\u2014the assets held in money market funds at the time. \n To prevent another occurrence of this crisis, the SEC \nlater proposed that money market funds no longer be \nallowed to \u201cround off\u201d value per share to $1, but instead be forced to recognize daily changes in value. Alterna-tively, funds wishing to maintain share value at $1 would be required to set aside reserves against potential invest-ment losses. But the mutual fund industry lobbied vehe-mently against these reforms, arguing that their customers demanded stable share prices and that the proposed capi-tal requirements would be so costly that the industry would no longer be viable. In the face of this opposition, the SEC commissioners voted in 2012 against the reforms, but they were given new life when the Financial Stability Oversight Council weighed in to support them. It is still too early to predict the final resolution of the debate.

What was its ask price the previous day?  CONCEPT CHECK 2.1 issued in increments of $100 but far more commonly trade \nin denominations of $1,000. Both notes and bonds make \nsemiannual interest payments called  coupon payments,   \na name derived from precomputer days, when investors \nwould literally clip coupons attached to the bond and pres-\nent a coupon to receive the interest payment. \n  Figure\u00a02.3  is a listing of Treasury issues. Notice the high-\nlighted note that matures in November 2015. Its bid price \nis 113.5078. (This is the decimal version of    11365/128 . The \nminimum  tick size,   or price increment in the Wall Street \nJournal  listing, is generally 1/128   of a point.) Although bonds \nare typically traded in denominations of $1,000 par value, \nprices are quoted as a percentage of par. Thus, the bid price \nshould be interpreted as 113.5078% of par, or $1,135.078 \nfor the $1,000 par value bond. Similarly, the ask price at \nwhich the bond could be sold to a dealer is 113.5391% of \npar, or $1,135.391. The  2 .0859 change means that the clos-\ning price on this day fell by .0859% of par value (equivalently, by 11/128 of a point) from the \nprevious day\u2019s close. Finally, the yield to maturity based on the ask price is .398%.  \n The    yield to maturity    reported in the financial pages is calculated by determining \nthe semiannual yield and then doubling it, rather than compounding it for two half-year \nperiods. This use of a simple interest technique to annualize means that the yield is \nquoted on an annual percentage rate (APR) basis rather than as an effective annual yield. \nThe APR method in this context is also called the  bond equivalent yield.   We discuss the \nyield to maturity in more detail in Part Four.   \n  Inflation-Protected Treasury Bonds \n The best place to start building an investment portfolio is at the least risky end of the \nspectrum. Around the world, governments of many countries, including the United States, \nhave issued bonds that are linked to an index of the cost of living in order to provide their \ncitizens with an effective way to hedge inflation risk. \n In the United States inflation-protected Treasury bonds are called TIPS (Treasury \nInflation-Protected Securities). The principal amount on these bonds is adjusted in propor-\ntion to increases in the Consumer Price Index. Therefore, they provide a constant stream \nof income in real (inflation-adjusted) dollars. Yields on TIPS bonds should be interpreted \nas real or inflation-adjusted interest rates. We return to TIPS bonds in more detail in \nChapter 14.  \n  Federal Agency Debt \n Some government agencies issue their own securities to finance their activities. These \nagencies usually are formed to channel credit to a particular sector of the economy that \nCongress believes might not receive adequate credit through normal private sources. \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   35bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   35 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n3 6  PART I  Introduction\n The major mortgage-related agencies are the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), the \nFederal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae), the Government National \nMortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie Mac). The FHLB borrows money by issuing securities and lends this money to savings and loan institutions to be lent in turn to individuals bor-rowing for home mortgages. \n Although the debt of federal agencies was never explicitly insured by the federal govern-\nment, it had long been assumed that the government would assist an agency nearing default. Those beliefs were validated when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac encountered severe finan-cial distress in September 2008. With both firms on the brink of insolvency, the government stepped in and put them both into conservatorship, assigned the Federal Housing Finance Agency to run the firms, but did in fact agree to make good on the firm\u2019s bonds.  \n  International Bonds \n Many firms borrow abroad and many investors buy bonds from foreign issuers. In addition to national capital markets, there is a thriving international capital market, largely centered in London. \n A  Eurobond  is a bond denominated in a currency other than that of the country in \nwhich it is issued. For example, a dollar-denominated bond sold in Britain would be called a Eurodollar bond. Similarly, investors might speak of Euroyen bonds, yen-denominated bonds sold outside Japan. Because the European currency is called the euro, the term Eurobond may be confusing. It is best to think of them simply as international bonds. \n In contrast to bonds that are issued in foreign currencies, many firms issue bonds in for-\neign countries but in the currency of the investor. For example, a Yankee bond is a dollar-denominated bond sold in the United States by a non-U.S. issuer. Similarly, Samurai bonds are yen-denominated bonds sold in Japan by non-Japanese issuers.  \n  Municipal Bonds \n    Municipal bonds    are issued by state and local governments. They are similar to Treasury and corporate bonds except that their interest income is exempt from federal income taxa-tion. The interest income also is usually exempt from state and local taxation in the issuing state. Capital gains taxes, however, must be paid on \u201cmunis\u201d when the bonds mature or if they are sold for more than the investor\u2019s purchase price. \n  General obligation  bonds are backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d (i.e., the taxing \npower) of the issuer, while  revenue bonds  are issued to finance particular projects and are \nbacked either by the revenues from that project or by the particular municipal agency oper-ating the project. Typical issuers of revenue bonds are airports, hospitals, and turnpike or port authorities. Obviously, revenue bonds are riskier in terms of default than general obli-gation bonds.  Figure\u00a02.4  plots outstanding amounts of both types of municipal securities.  \n An  industrial development bond  is a revenue bond that is issued to finance commercial \nenterprises, such as the construction of a factory that can be operated by a private firm. In effect, these private-purpose bonds give the firm access to the municipality\u2019s ability to bor-row at tax-exempt rates, and the federal government limits the amount of these bonds that may be issued.  \n2      \n Like Treasury bonds, municipal bonds vary widely in maturity. A good deal of the debt \nissued is in the form of short-term  tax anticipation notes,  which raise funds to pay for \n 2 A warning, however. Although interest on industrial development bonds usually is exempt from federal tax, it \ncan be subject to the alternative minimum tax if the bonds are used to finance projects of for-profit companies.\nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   36bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   36 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 2 Asset Classes and Financial Instruments 37\nexpenses before actual collection of taxes. Other municipal debt is long term and used to \nfund large capital investments. Maturities range up to 30 years. \n The key feature of municipal bonds is their tax-exempt status. Because investors pay \nneither federal nor state taxes on the interest proceeds, they are willing to accept lower \nyields on these securities. \n An investor choosing between taxable and tax-exempt bonds must compare after-tax \nreturns on each bond. An exact comparison requires a computation of after-tax rates of \nreturn that explicitly accounts for taxes on income and realized capital gains. In practice, \nthere is a simpler rule of thumb. If we let  t  denote the investor\u2019s combined federal plus \nlocal marginal tax bracket and  r  denote the total before-tax rate of return available on tax-\nable bonds, then  r  (1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 t ) is the after-tax rate available on those securities.  3   If this value \nexceeds the rate on municipal bonds,  r   m  , the investor does better holding the taxable bonds. \nOtherwise, the tax-exempt municipals provide higher after-tax returns.     \n One way to compare bonds is to determine the interest rate on taxable bonds that would be \nnecessary to provide an after-tax return equal to that of municipals. To derive this value, we \nset after-tax yields equal, and solve for the    equivalent taxable yield    of the tax-exempt bond. \nThis is the rate a taxable bond must offer to match the after-tax yield on the tax-free municipal.\n    r (1 2 t) 5 rm  (2.1)   \n or\n    r 5 rm /(12 t)  (2.2)   \n Thus the equivalent taxable yield is simply the tax-free rate divided by 1  2 \u00a0 t.   Table\u00a02.2  \npresents equivalent taxable yields for several municipal yields and tax rates.  \n3 An approximation to the combined federal plus local tax rate is just the sum of the two rates. For example, \nif your federal tax rate is 28% and your state rate is 5%, your combined tax rate would be approximately \n33%. A more precise approach would recognize that state taxes are deductible at the federal level. You owe \nfederal taxes only on income net of state taxes. Therefore, for every dollar of income, your after-tax proceeds \nwould be (1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 t  federal  )\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 t  state ). In our example, your after-tax proceeds on each dollar earned would be \n(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.28)\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.05)\u00a0 5 \u00a0.684, which implies a combined tax rate of 1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.684\u00a0 5 \u00a0.316, or 31.6%.\n Figure 2.4 Tax-exempt debt outstanding  \n Source:  Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States,   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2012. \n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n19981983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n20012000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n20122003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011Industrial Revenue Bonds\nGeneral Obligation\n05001,0001,500$ Billion2,0002,5003,000\nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   37bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   37 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n3 8 PART I  Introduction\n This table frequently appears in the marketing literature for tax-exempt mutual bond \nfunds because it demonstrates to high-tax-bracket investors that municipal bonds offer \nhighly attractive equivalent taxable yields. Each entry is calculated from Equation 2.2. If \nthe equivalent taxable yield exceeds the actual yields offered on taxable bonds, the investor \nis better off after taxes holding municipal bonds. Notice that the equivalent taxable interest \nrate increases with the investor\u2019s tax bracket; the higher the bracket, the more valuable the \ntax-exempt feature of municipals. Thus high-tax-bracket investors tend to hold municipals. \n We also can use Equation 2.1 or 2.2 to find the tax bracket at which investors are indif-\nferent between taxable and tax-exempt bonds. The cutoff tax bracket is given by solving \nEquation 2.2 for the tax bracket at which after-tax yields are equal. Doing so, we find that\nt512rm\nr  (2.3)   \n Thus the yield ratio  r   m  / r  is a key determinant of the attractiveness of municipal bonds. The \nhigher the yield ratio, the lower the cutoff tax bracket, and the more individuals will prefer \nto hold municipal debt.  Figure\u00a02.5  plots the ratio of 20-year municipal debt yields to the \n Table 2.2 \n Equivalent taxable \nyields corresponding \nto various tax-exempt \nyields Tax-Exempt Yield\nMarginal Tax Rate 1% 2% 3% 4% 5%\n20% 1.25% 2.50% 3.75% 5.00% 6.25%\n30 1.43 2.86 4.29 5.71 7.14\n40 1.67 3.33 5.00 6.67 8.33\n50 2.00 4.00 6.00 8.00 10.00\n Figure 2.5 Ratio of yields on municipal debt to corporate Baa-rated debt  \n Source: Authors\u2019 calculations, using data from   www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm. \n0.5\n1953\n1956\n1959\n1962\n1965\n1968\n1971\n1974\n1977\n1980\n1983\n1986\n1989\n1992\n1995\n1998\n2001\n2004\n2007\n2010\n20130.60.7Ratio0.80.9\nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   38bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   38 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 2 Asset Classes and Financial Instruments 39\nyield on Baa-rated corporate debt. The default risk of these corporate and municipal bonds \nmay be comparable, but certainly will fluctuate over time. For example, the sharp run-up in the ratio in 2011 probably reflects increased concern at the time about the precarious financial condition of several states and municipalities.     \n  Figure\u00a02.5  shows that in recent years, the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields has fluc-\ntuated around .70. What does this imply about the cutoff tax bracket above which \ntax-exempt bonds provide higher after-tax yields? Equation 2.3 shows that an inves-tor whose tax bracket (federal plus local) exceeds 1\u00a0 2 .70\u00a0 5 \u00a0.30, or 30%, will derive \na greater after-tax yield from municipals. Note, however, that it is difficult to control precisely for differences in the risks of these bonds, so the cutoff tax bracket must be taken as approximate.  Example 2.1 Taxable versus Tax-Exempt Yields \n Suppose your tax bracket is 30%. Would you prefer to earn a 6% taxable return \nor a 4% tax-free return? What is the equivalent taxable yield of the 4% tax-free yield?  CONCEPT CHECK 2.2 \n  Corporate Bonds \n Corporate bonds are the means by which private firms borrow money directly from the \npublic. These bonds are similar in structure to Treasury issues\u2014they typically pay semi-annual coupons over their lives and return the face value to the bondholder at maturity. They differ most importantly from Treasury bonds in degree of risk. Default risk is a real consideration in the purchase of corporate bonds, and Chapter 14 discusses this issue in considerable detail. For now, we distinguish only among  secured bonds,  which have spe-\ncific collateral backing them in the event of firm bankruptcy; unsecured bonds, called  debentures,  which have no collateral; and  subordinated debentures,  which have a lower \npriority claim to the firm\u2019s assets in the event of bankruptcy. \n Corporate bonds sometimes come with options attached.  Callable bonds  give the firm \nthe option to repurchase the bond from the holder at a stipulated call price.  Convertible \nbonds  give the bondholder the option to convert each bond into a stipulated number of \nshares of stock. These options are treated in more detail in Chapter 14.  \n  Mortgages and Mortgage-Backed Securities \n Because of the explosion in mortgage-backed securities, almost anyone can invest in a portfolio of mortgage loans, and these securities have become a major component of the fixed-income market. As described in Chapter 1, a  mortgage-backed security  is either \nan ownership claim in a pool of mortgages or an obligation that is secured by such a pool. Most pass-throughs have traditionally been comprised of  conforming mortgages,   \nwhich means that the loans must satisfy certain underwriting guidelines (standards for the credit-worthiness of the borrower) before they may be purchased by Fannie Mae \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   39bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   39 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 0 PART I  Introduction\nor Freddie Mac. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, however, a large amount \nof  subprime mortgages,   that is, riskier loans made to financially weaker borrowers, \nwere bundled and sold by \u201cprivate-label\u201d issuers.  Figure\u00a02.6  illustrates the explosive \ngrowth of both agency and private-label mortgage-backed securities, at least until \nthe crisis.  \n In an effort to make housing more affordable to low-income households, Fannie and \nFreddie had been encouraged to buy subprime mortgage securities. As we saw in Chapter\u00a01, \nthese loans turned out to be disastrous, with trillion-dollar losses spread among banks, \nhedge funds and other investors, and Freddie and Fannie, which lost billions of dollars on \nthe subprime mortgage pools they had purchased. You can see from  Figure\u00a02.6  that start-\ning in 2007, the market in private-label mortgage pass-throughs began to shrink rapidly. \nAgency pass-throughs shrank even more precipitously following an agreement for Freddie \nand Fannie to wind down purchases of mortgages for new pass-throughs. At the same time, \nexisting pass-throughs shrank as healthy loans were paid off and delinquent loans were \nremoved from outstanding pools. \n Despite these troubles, few believe that securitization itself will cease, although prac-\ntices in this market are highly likely to become far more conservative than in previous \nyears, particularly with respect to the credit standards that must be met by the ultimate \nborrower. Indeed, securitization has become an increasingly common staple of many \ncredit markets. For example, car loans, student loans, home equity loans, credit card \nloans, and even debt of private firms now are commonly bundled into pass-through secu-\nrities that can be traded in the capital market.  Figure\u00a02.7  documents the rapid growth of \nnonmortgage asset-backed securities.    The market expanded more than five-fold in the \ndecade ending 2007. After the financial crisis, it contracted considerably as the perceived \nrisks of credit card and home equity loans skyrocketed, but the asset-backed market is \nstill substantial.    \n Figure 2.6 Mortgage-backed securities outstanding  \n Source:  Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States,   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2012.   \n0\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n20121,0002,0003,0004,0005,000$ Billions6,0007,0008,000\nFederal AgenciesPrivate Issuers\nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   40bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   40 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 2 Asset Classes and Financial Instruments 41\n Figure 2.7 Asset-backed securities outstanding  \n Source: The Securities & Industry and Financial Markets Association,   www.sifma.org   .\n0\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012200400600$ Billion\n8001,0001,2001,4001,6001,8002,000\nAutomobile\nCredit Card\nEquipment\nHome Equity\nManufactured\nHousing\nStudent Loans\n   Common Stock as Ownership Shares \nCommon stocks,   also known as  equity securities   or    equities,      represent ownership shares in \na corporation. Each share of common stock entitles its owner to one vote on any matters \nof corporate governance that are put to a vote at the corporation\u2019s annual meeting and to a \nshare in the financial benefits of ownership.  4      \n The corporation is controlled by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. The \nboard, which meets only a few times each year, selects managers who actually run the \ncorporation on a day-to-day basis. Managers have the authority to make most business \ndecisions without the board\u2019s specific approval. The board\u2019s mandate is to oversee the \nmanagement to ensure that it acts in the best interests of shareholders. \n The members of the board are elected at the annual meeting. Shareholders who do \nnot attend the annual meeting can vote by  proxy,   empowering another party to vote in \ntheir name. Management usually solicits the proxies of shareholders and normally gets a \nvast majority of these proxy votes. Thus, management usually has considerable discretion    2.3 Equity Securities \n4 A corporation sometimes issues two classes of common stock, one bearing the right to vote, the other not. \nBecause of its restricted rights, the nonvoting stock might sell for a lower price.\nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   41bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   41 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 2  PART I  Introduction\nto run the firm as it sees fit\u2014without daily oversight from the equityholders who actually \nown the firm. \n We noted in Chapter 1 that such separation of ownership and control can give rise to \n\u201cagency problems,\u201d in which managers pursue goals not in the best interests of sharehold-ers. However, there are several mechanisms that alleviate these agency problems. Among these are compensation schemes that link the success of the manager to that of the firm; oversight by the board of directors as well as outsiders such as security analysts, creditors, or large institutional investors; the threat of a proxy contest in which unhappy shareholders attempt to replace the current management team; or the threat of a takeover by another firm. \n The common stock of most large corporations can be bought or sold freely on one \nor more stock exchanges. A corporation whose stock is not publicly traded is said to be closely held. In most closely held corporations, the owners of the firm also take an active role in its management. Therefore, takeovers are generally not an issue.  \n  Characteristics of Common Stock \n The two most important characteristics of common stock as an investment are its    residual \nclaim    and    limited liability    features. \n Residual claim means that stockholders are the last in line of all those who have a \nclaim on the assets and income of the corporation. In a liquidation of the firm\u2019s assets the shareholders have a claim to what is left after all other claimants such as the tax authorities, employees, suppliers, bondholders, and other creditors have been paid. For a firm not in liquidation, shareholders have claim to the part of operating income left over after inter-\nest and taxes have been paid. Management can either pay this residual as cash dividends to shareholders or reinvest it in the business to increase the value of the shares. \n \n Limited liability means that the most shareholders \ncan lose in the event of failure of the corporation is their original investment. Unlike owners of unincorporated businesses, whose creditors can lay claim to the personal assets of the owner (house, car, furniture), corporate shareholders may at worst have worthless stock. They are not personally liable for the firm\u2019s obligations.  \n  Stock Market Listings \n  Figure\u00a02.8  presents key trading data for a small sample of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE is one of several markets in which investors may buy or sell shares of stock. We will examine these markets in detail in Chapter 3. \n To interpret  Figure\u00a02.8 , consider the highlighted listing for General Electric. The table \nprovides the ticker symbol (GE), the closing price of the stock ($19.72), and its change ( 1 $.13) from the previous trading day. About 45.3 million shares of GE traded on this \nday. The listing also provides the highest and lowest price at which GE has traded in the last 52 weeks. The .68 value in the Dividend column means that the last quarterly divi-dend payment was $.17 per share, which is consistent with annual dividend payments of $.17\u00a0 3 \u00a04\u00a0 5 \u00a0$.68. This corresponds to an annual dividend yield (i.e., annual dividend per \ndollar paid for the stock) of .68/19.72\u00a0 5 \u00a0.0345, or 3.45%. \n The dividend yield is only part of the return on a stock investment. It ignores prospective \n capital gains  (i.e., price increases) or losses. Low-dividend firms presumably offer greater \nprospects for capital gains, or investors would not be willing to hold these stocks in their port-folios. If you scan  Figure\u00a02.8 , you will see that dividend yields vary widely across companies.       a.  If you buy 100 shares of IBM stock, to what \nare you entitled?  \n    b.  What is the most money you can make on this investment over the next year?  \n    c.  If you pay $180 per share, what is the most \nmoney you could lose over the year?

The P/E ratio tells us how much stock purchasers must pay per \ndollar of earnings that the firm generates. For GE, the ratio of price to earnings is 16.01. \nThe P/E ratio also varies widely across firms. Where the dividend yield and P/E ratio are \nnot reported in  Figure\u00a02.8 , the firms have zero dividends, or zero or negative earnings. We \nshall have much to say about P/E ratios in Chapter 18. Finally, we see that GE\u2019s stock price \nhas increased by 10.11% since the beginning of the year.  \n  Preferred Stock \n    Preferred stock    has features similar to both equity and debt. Like a bond, it promises \nto pay to its holder a fixed amount of income each year. In this sense preferred stock \nis similar to an infinite-maturity bond, that is, a perpetuity. It also resembles a bond in \nthat it does not convey voting power regarding the management of the firm. Preferred \nstock is an equity investment, however. The firm retains discretion to make the dividend \npayments to the preferred stockholders; it has no contractual obligation to pay those \ndividends. Instead, preferred dividends are usually  cumulative;   that is, unpaid dividends \ncumulate and must be paid in full before any dividends may be paid to holders of com-\nmon stock. In contrast, the firm does have a contractual obligation to make the interest \npayments on the debt. Failure to make these payments sets off corporate bankruptcy \nproceedings. \n Preferred stock also differs from bonds in terms of its tax treatment for the firm. \nBecause preferred stock payments are treated as dividends rather than interest, they are \nnot tax-deductible expenses for the firm. This disadvantage is somewhat offset by the fact \nthat corporations may exclude 70% of dividends received from domestic corporations in \nthe computation of their taxable income. Preferred stocks therefore make desirable fixed- \nincome investments for some corporations. \n Even though preferred stock ranks after bonds in terms of the priority of its claims \nto the assets of the firm in the event of corporate bankruptcy, preferred stock often \nsells at lower yields than do corporate bonds. Presumably, this reflects the value of the \ndividend exclusion, because the higher risk of preferred would tend to result in higher \nyields than those offered by bonds.

It may be \ncallable by the issuing firm, in which case it is said to be  redeemable.  It also may be con-\nvertible into common stock at some specified conversion ratio. Adjustable-rate preferred stock is another variation that, like adjustable-rate bonds, ties the dividend to current mar-ket interest rates.  \n  Depository Receipts \n American Depository Receipts, or ADRs, are certificates traded in U.S. markets that repre-sent ownership in shares of a foreign company. Each ADR may correspond to ownership of a fraction of a foreign share, one share, or several shares of the foreign corporation. ADRs were created to make it easier for foreign firms to satisfy U.S. security registration require-ments. They are the most common way for U.S. investors to invest in and trade the shares of foreign corporations.    \n   Stock Market Indexes \n The daily performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a staple portion of the  evening news report. Although the Dow is the best-known measure of the performance of the stock market, it is only one of several indicators. Other more broadly based indexes \nare computed and published daily. In addition, several indexes of bond market perfor-mance are widely available. \n The ever-increasing role of international trade and investments has made indexes of \nforeign financial markets part of the general news as well. Thus foreign stock exchange indexes such as the Nikkei Average of Tokyo and the Financial Times index of London are fast becoming household names.  \n  Dow Jones Averages \n The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) of 30 large, \u201cblue-chip\u201d corporations has been computed since 1896. Its long history probably accounts for its preeminence in the public mind. (The average covered only 20 stocks until 1928.) \n Originally, the DJIA was calculated as the average price of the stocks included in the \nindex. Thus, one would add up the prices of the 30 stocks in the index and divide by 30. The percentage change in the DJIA would then be the percentage change in the average price of the 30 shares. \n This procedure means that the percentage change in the DJIA measures the return \n(excluding dividends) on a portfolio that invests one share in each of the 30 stocks in the index. The value of such a portfolio (holding one share of each stock in the index) is the sum of the 30 prices. Because the percentage change in the  average  of the 30 prices is \nthe same as the percentage change in the  sum  of the 30 prices, the index and the portfolio \nhave the same percentage change each day. \n Because the Dow corresponds to a portfolio that holds one share of each component \nstock, the investment in each company in that portfolio is proportional to the company\u2019s share price. Therefore, the Dow is called a    price-weighted average.         2.4 Stock and Bond Market Indexes \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   44bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   44 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 2 Asset Classes and Financial Instruments 45\n Consider the data in  Table\u00a02.3  for a hypothetical two-stock version of the Dow Jones \nAverage. Let\u2019s compare the changes in the value of the portfolio holding one share of \neach firm and the price-weighted index. Stock ABC starts at $25 a share and increases to \n$30. Stock XYZ starts at $100, but falls to $90.  \n   Portfolio: Initial value\u00a0 5 \u00a0$25\u00a0 1 \u00a0$100\u00a0 5 \u00a0$125  \n   Final value\u00a0 5 \u00a0$30\u00a0 1 \u00a0$90\u00a0 5 \u00a0$120  \n   Percentage change in portfolio value\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 \u00a05/125\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 \u00a0.04\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 4%  \n  Index: Initial index value\u00a0 5 \u00a0(25\u00a0 1 \u00a0100)/2\u00a0 5 \u00a062.5  \n   Final index value\u00a0 5 \u00a0(30\u00a0 1 \u00a090)/2\u00a0 5 \u00a060  \n   Percentage change in index\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 \u00a02.5/62.5\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 \u00a0.04\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 4%   \n The portfolio and the index have identical 4% declines in value. \n Notice that price-weighted averages give higher-priced shares more weight \nin determining performance of the index. For example, although ABC increased \nby 20%, while XYZ fell by only 10%, the index dropped in value. This is because \nthe 20% increase in ABC represented a smaller price gain ($5 per share) than the \n10% decrease in XYZ ($10 per share). The \u201cDow portfolio\u201d has four times as much \ninvested in XYZ as in ABC because XYZ\u2019s price is four times that of ABC. Therefore, \nXYZ dominates the average. We conclude that a high-price stock can dominate a \nprice-weighted average.  Example 2.2 Price-Weighted Average \n You might wonder why the DJIA is now (in early 2013) at a level of about 14,000 if it is \nsupposed to be the average price of the 30 stocks in the index. The DJIA no longer equals \nthe average price of the 30 stocks because the averaging procedure is adjusted whenever a \nstock splits or pays a stock dividend of more than 10%, or when one company in the group \nof 30 industrial firms is replaced by another. When these events occur, the divisor used to \ncompute the \u201caverage price\u201d is adjusted so as to leave the index unaffected by the event. \n Suppose XYZ were to split two for one so that its share price fell to $50. We would not \nwant the average to fall, as that would incorrectly indicate a fall in the general level of \nmarket prices. Following a split, the divisor must be reduced to a value that leaves the \naverage unaffected.  Table\u00a02.4  illustrates this point. The initial share price of XYZ, which  Example 2.3 Splits and Price-Weighted Averages \nStockInitial \nPriceFinal \nPriceShares \n(million)Initial Value of \nOutstanding \nStock ($ million)Final Value of \nOutstanding \nStock ($ million)\nABC $25 $30 20 $500 $600\nXYZ 100   90   1  100  90\n Total $600 $690Table 2.3\nData to construct \nstock price indexes\nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   45bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   45 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 6 PART I  Introduction\n  In the same way that the divisor is updated for stock splits, if one firm is dropped from \nthe average and another firm with a different price is added, the divisor has to be updated \nto leave the average unchanged by the substitution. By 2013, the divisor for the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average had fallen to a value of about .1302. \n Because the Dow Jones averages are based on small numbers of firms, care must be \ntaken to ensure that they are representative of the broad market. As a result, the composi-\ntion of the average is changed every so often to reflect changes in the economy.  Table\u00a02.5  \npresents the composition of the Dow industrials in 1928 as well as its composition as of \nmid-2013. The table presents striking evidence of the changes in the U.S. economy in the \nlast 85 years. Many of the \u201cbluest of the blue chip\u201d companies in 1928 no longer exist, and \nthe industries that were the backbone of the economy in 1928 have given way to some that \ncould not have been imagined at the time.     was $100 in  Table\u00a02.3 , falls to $50 if the stock splits at the beginning of the period. \nNotice that the number of shares outstanding doubles, leaving the market value of the \ntotal shares unaffected.  \n We find the new divisor as follows. The index value before the stock split\u00a0 5  125/2  5\n62.5. We must find a new divisor,  d,  that leaves the index unchanged after XYZ splits and \nits price falls to $50. Therefore, we solve for  d  in the following equation:\n   Price of ABC 1Price of XYZ\nd525150\nd562.5  \n which implies that the divisor must fall from its original value of 2.0 to a new value of 1.20. \n Because the split changes the price of stock XYZ, it also changes the relative weights \nof the two stocks in the price-weighted average. Therefore, the return of the index is \naffected by the split. \n At period-end, ABC will sell for $30, while XYZ will sell for $45, representing the \nsame negative 10% return it was assumed to earn in  Table\u00a02.3 . The new value of the \nprice-weighted average is (30\u00a0 1 \u00a045)/1.20\u00a0 5 \u00a062.5, the same as its value at the start of \nthe year; therefore, the rate of return is zero, rather than the  2 4% return that we calcu-\nlated in the absence of a split. \n The split reduces the relative weight of XYZ because its initial price is lower; \nbecause XYZ is the poorer performing stock, the performance of the average \nis higher. This example illustrates that the implicit weighting scheme of a price-\nweighted average is somewhat arbitrary, being determined by the prices rather than \nby the outstanding market values (price per share times number of shares) of the \nshares in the average. \n Table 2.4 \n Data to construct \nstock price indexes \nafter a stock split StockInitial \nPriceFinal \nPriceShares \n(million)Initial Value of \nOutstanding \nStock ($ million)Final Value of \nOutstanding \nStock ($ million)\nABC $25 $30 20 $500 $600\nXYZ   50   45   2  100   90\n Total $600 $690\nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   46bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   46 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 2 Asset Classes and Financial Instruments 47\n Suppose the price of XYZ in  Table\u00a02.3  increases to $110, while ABC falls to $20. \nFind the percentage change in the price-weighted average of these two stocks. \nCompare that to the percentage return of a portfolio holding one share in each \ncompany.

First, it is a more broadly based index of 500 firms. Second, it is a    market-value-weighted index  .    In the case of the firms XYZ and \nABC in Example 2.2, the S&P 500 would give ABC five times the weight given to XYZ because the market value of its outstanding equity is five times larger, $500 million versus $100 million. \n The S&P 500 is computed by calculating the total market value of the 500 firms in the \nindex and the total market value of those firms on the previous day of trading. The percent-age increase in the total market value from one day to the next represents the increase in the index. The rate of return of the index equals the rate of return that would be earned by an investor holding a portfolio of all 500 firms in the index in proportion to their market values, except that the index does not reflect cash dividends paid by those firms. \n Actually, most indexes today use a modified version of market-value weights. Rather \nthan weighting by total market value, they weight by the market value of  free float,  that is, \nby the value of shares that are freely tradable among investors. For example, this procedure does not count shares held by founding families or governments. These shares are effec-tively not available for investors to purchase. The distinction is more important in Japan and Europe, where a higher fraction of shares are held in such nontraded portfolios. \n \n To illustrate how value-weighted indexes are computed, look again at  Table\u00a02.3 . The \nfinal value of all outstanding stock in our two-stock universe is $690 million. The initial \nvalue was $600 million. Therefore, if the initial level of a market-value-weighted index of stocks ABC and XYZ were set equal to an arbitrarily chosen starting value such as 100, the index value at year-end would be 100\u00a0 3 \u00a0(690/600)\u00a0 5 \u00a0115. The increase in the \nindex reflects the 15% return earned on a portfolio consisting of those two stocks held in proportion to outstanding market values. \n Unlike the price-weighted index, the value-weighted index gives more weight to \nABC. Whereas the price-weighted index fell because it was dominated by higher-price \nXYZ, the value-weighted index rises because it gives more weight to ABC, the stock with the higher total market value. \n Note also from  Tables\u00a02.3  and  2.4  that market-value-weighted indexes are unaffected \nby stock splits. The total market value of the outstanding XYZ stock decreases from $100 \nmillion to $90 million regardless of the stock split, thereby rendering the split irrelevant to the performance of the index.  Example 2.4 Value-Weighted Indexes \n Reconsider companies XYZ and ABC from Concept Check 2.4. Calculate the percentage change in the \nmarket-value-weighted index. Compare that to the rate of return of a portfolio that holds $500 of ABC stock for every $100 of XYZ stock (i.e., an index portfolio).  CONCEPT CHECK 2.5 \n  A nice feature of both market-value-weighted and price-weighted indexes is that \nthey reflect the returns to straightforward portfolio strategies. If one were to buy shares \nin each component firm in the index in proportion to its outstanding market value, the \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   48bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   48 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 2 Asset Classes and Financial Instruments 49\nvalue-weighted index would perfectly track capital gains on the underlying portfolio. \nSimilarly, a price-weighted index tracks the returns on a portfolio comprised of an equal number of shares of each firm. \n Investors today can easily buy market indexes for their portfolios. One way is to pur-\nchase shares in mutual funds that hold shares in proportion to their representation in the S&P 500 or another index. These    index funds    yield a return equal to that of the index and \nso provide a low-cost passive investment strategy for equity investors. Another approach is to purchase an  exchange-traded fund,  or ETF, which is a portfolio of shares that can be \nbought or sold as a unit, just as one can buy or sell a single share of stock. Available ETFs range from portfolios that track extremely broad global market indexes all the way to nar-row industry indexes. We discuss both mutual funds and ETFs in detail in Chapter 4. \n Standard & Poor\u2019s also publishes a 400-stock Industrial Index, a 20-stock Transportation \nIndex, a 40-stock Utility Index, and a 40-stock Financial Index.  \n  Other U.S. Market-Value Indexes \n The New York Stock Exchange publishes a market-value-weighted composite index of all NYSE-listed stocks, in addition to subindexes for industrial, utility, transportation, and financial stocks. These indexes are even more broadly based than the S&P 500. The National Association of Securities Dealers publishes an index of more than 3,000 firms traded on the NASDAQ market. \n The ultimate U.S. equity index so far computed is the Wilshire 5000 index of the market \nvalue of essentially all actively traded stocks in the U.S. Despite its name, the index actu-ally includes more than 5,000 stocks. The performance of many of these indexes appears daily in  The Wall Street Journal.   \n  Equally Weighted Indexes \n Market performance is sometimes measured by an equally weighted average of the returns of each stock in an index. Such an averaging technique, by placing equal weight on each return, corresponds to an implicit portfolio strategy that invests equal dollar values in each stock. This is in contrast to both price weighting (which requires equal numbers of shares of each stock) and market-value weighting (which requires investments in proportion to outstanding value). \n Unlike price- or market-value-weighted indexes, equally weighted indexes do not corre-\nspond to buy-and-hold portfolio strategies. Suppose that you start with equal dollar invest-ments in the two stocks of  Table\u00a02.3 , ABC and XYZ. Because ABC increases in value by 20% over the year while XYZ decreases by 10%, your portfolio no longer is equally weighted. It is now more heavily invested in ABC. To reset the portfolio to equal weights, you would need to rebalance: Sell off some ABC stock and/or purchase more XYZ stock. Such rebalancing would be necessary to align the return on your portfolio with that on the equally weighted index.  \n  Foreign and International Stock Market Indexes \n Development in financial markets worldwide includes the construction of indexes for these markets. Among these are the Nikkei (Japan), FTSE (U.K.; pronounced \u201cfootsie\u201d), DAX (Germany), Hang Seng (Hong Kong), and TSX (Canada). \n A leader in the construction of international indexes has been MSCI (Morgan Stanley \nCapital International), which computes over 50 country indexes and several regional indexes.  Table\u00a02.6  presents many of the indexes computed by MSCI.   \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   49bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   49 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n5 0 PART I  Introduction\n  Bond Market Indicators \n Just as stock market indexes provide guidance concerning the performance of the overall \nstock market, several bond market indicators measure the performance of various catego-\nries of bonds. The three most well-known groups of indexes are those of Merrill Lynch, \nBarclays (formerly, the Lehman Brothers index), and Salomon Smith Barney (now part \nof Citigroup).  Figure\u00a02.9  shows the components of the U.S. fixed-income market in 2012.  \n The major problem with bond market indexes is that true rates of return on many \nbonds are difficult to compute because the infrequency with which the bonds trade \nmakes reliable up-to-date prices difficult to obtain. In practice, some prices must \nbe estimated from bond-valuation models. These \u201cmatrix\u201d prices may differ from true \nmarket values.    \n Table 2.6 \n Sample of MSCI stock indexes \n Source:  MSCI, www.msci.com.  Used with permission.

These instruments provide \npayoffs that depend on the values of other assets such as commodity prices, bond and stock \nprices, or market index values. For this reason these instruments sometimes are called \n  derivative assets.      Their values derive from the values of other assets.  \n   Options \n A    call option    gives its holder the right to purchase an asset for a specified price, called \nthe    exercise    or    strike price  ,     on or before a specified expiration date. For example, a July \ncall option on IBM stock with an exercise price of $180 entitles its owner to purchase IBM \nstock for a price of $180 at any time up to and including the expiration date in July. Each \noption contract is for the purchase of 100 shares. However, quotations are made on a per-\nshare basis. The holder of the call need not exercise the option; it will be profitable to exer-\ncise only if the market value of the asset that may be purchased exceeds the exercise price. \n When the market price exceeds the exercise price, the option holder may \u201ccall away\u201d \nthe asset for the exercise price and reap a payoff equal to the difference between the stock \nprice and the exercise price. Otherwise, the option will be left unexercised. If not exercised \nbefore the expiration date of the contract, the option simply expires and no longer has \nvalue. Calls therefore provide greater profits when stock prices increase and thus represent \nbullish investment vehicles. \n In contrast, a    put option    gives its holder the right to sell an asset for a specified exercise \nprice on or before a specified expiration date. A July put on IBM with an exercise price \nof $180 thus entitles its owner to sell IBM stock to the put writer at a price of $180 at any \ntime before expiration in July, even if the market price of IBM is lower than $180. Whereas \nprofits on call options increase when the asset increases in value, profits on put options    2.5 Derivative Markets \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   51bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   51 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n5 2 PART I  Introduction\nincrease when the asset value falls. The put is exercised only if its holder can deliver an \nasset worth less than the exercise price in return for the exercise price. \n  Figure\u00a02.10  is an excerpt of the options quotations for IBM from the online edition of \nThe Wall Street Journal.   The price of IBM shares on this date was $183.65. The first two \ncolumns give the expiration month and exercise (or strike) price for each option. We have \nincluded listings for call and put options with exercise prices of $180 and $185 per share \nand with expiration dates in July, August, and October 2012 and January 2013.  \n The next columns provide the closing prices, trading volume, and open interest (out-\nstanding contracts) of each option. For example, 1,998 contracts traded on the July 2012 \nexpiration call with an exercise price of $180. The last trade was at $5.50, meaning that \nan option to purchase one share of IBM at an exercise price of $180 sold for $5.50. Each \noption  contract   (on 100 shares) therefore costs $550. \n Notice that the prices of call options decrease as the exercise price increases. For exam-\nple, the July expiration call with exercise price $185 costs only $2.80. This makes sense, \nbecause the right to purchase a share at a higher price is less valuable. Conversely, put \nprices increase with the exercise price. The right to sell IBM at a price of $180 in July costs \n$2.11, while the right to sell at $185 costs $4.20. \n Option prices also increase with time until expiration. Clearly, one would rather have \nthe right to buy IBM for $180 at any time until October rather than at any time until July. \nNot surprisingly, this shows up in a higher price for the October expiration options. For \nexample, the call with exercise price $180 expiring in October sells for $9.70 compared to \nonly $5.50 for the July call.

The  long position   is held by the trader who commits to purchasing the \nasset on the delivery date. The trader who takes the  short position   commits to delivering \nthe asset at contract maturity. \n  Figure\u00a02.11  illustrates the listing of the corn futures contract on the Chicago Board of \nTrade for July 17, 2012. Each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels of corn. Each row \ndetails prices for contracts expiring on various dates. The first row is for the nearest term \nor \u201cfront\u201d contract, with maturity in September 2012. The most recent price was $7.95 per \nbushel. (The numbers after the apostrophe denote eighths of a cent.) That price is up $.155 \nfrom yesterday\u2019s close. The next columns show the contract\u2019s opening price as well as the \nhigh and low price during the trading day. V olume is the number of contracts trading that \nday; open interest is the number of outstanding contracts.  \n The trader holding the long position profits from price increases. Suppose that at con-\ntract maturity, corn is selling for $7.97 per bushel. The long position trader who entered \nthe contract at the futures price of $7.95 on July 17 would pay the previously agreed-upon \n$7.95 for each bushel of corn, which at contract maturity would be worth $7.97. \n Because each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, the profit to the long posi-\ntion would equal 5,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0($7.97\u00a0 2 \u00a0$7.95)\u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,000. Conversely, the short position must \ndeliver 5,000 bushels for the previously agreed-upon futures price. The short position\u2019s \nloss equals the long position\u2019s profit. \n The right to purchase the asset at an agreed-upon price, as opposed to the obligation, \ndistinguishes call options from long positions in futures contracts. A futures contract \n obliges   the long position to purchase the asset at the futures price; the call option, in con-\ntrast,  conveys the right   to purchase the asset at the exercise price. The purchase will be \nmade only if it yields a profit. \n Clearly, a holder of a call has a better position than the holder of a long position on a \nfutures contract with a futures price equal to the option\u2019s exercise price. This advantage, of \ncourse, comes only at a price. Call options must be purchased; futures contracts are entered \ninto without cost. The purchase price of an option is called the  premium.   It represents the com-\npensation the purchaser of the call must pay for the ability to exercise the option only when it \nis profitable to do so. Similarly, the difference between a put option and a short futures posi-\ntion is the right, as opposed to the obligation, to sell an asset at an agreed-upon price.     \n Figure 2.11 Corn futures prices in the Chicago Board of Trade, July 17, 2012  \n Source:  The Wall Street Journal Online,   July 17, 2012.

Money market securities are very short-term debt obligations. They are usually highly market-\nable and have relatively low credit risk. Their low maturities and low credit risk ensure minimal capital gains or losses. These securities trade in large denominations, but they may be purchased indirectly through money market funds.  \n    2 .   Much of U.S. government borrowing is in the form of Treasury bonds and notes. These are coupon-paying bonds usually issued at or near par value. Treasury notes and bonds are similar in design to coupon-paying corporate bonds.  \n    3 .   Municipal bonds are distinguished largely by their tax-exempt status. Interest payments (but not capital gains) on these securities are exempt from federal income taxes. The equivalent taxable yield offered by a municipal bond equals  r  \n m  /(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 t ), where  r   m   is the municipal yield and  t  is the \ninvestor\u2019s tax bracket.  \n    4 .   Mortgage pass-through securities are pools of mortgages sold in one package. Owners of pass-\nthroughs receive the principal and interest payments made by the borrowers. The originator that issued the mortgage merely services it, simply \u201cpassing through\u201d the payments to the purchas-ers of the mortgage. A federal agency may guarantee the payments of interest and principal on mortgages pooled into its pass-through securities, but these guarantees are absent in private-label pass-throughs.  \n    5 .   Common stock is an ownership share in a corporation. Each share entitles its owner to one vote on matters of corporate governance and to a prorated share of the dividends paid to shareholders. Stock, or equity, owners are the residual claimants on the income earned by the firm.  \n    6 .   Preferred stock usually pays fixed dividends for the life of the firm; it is a perpetuity. A firm\u2019s failure to pay the dividend due on preferred stock, however, does not precipitate corporate bank-ruptcy. Instead, unpaid dividends simply cumulate. Newer varieties of preferred stock include convertible and adjustable-rate issues.  \n    7 .   Many stock market indexes measure the performance of the overall market. The Dow Jones averages, the oldest and best-known indicators, are price-weighted indexes. Today, many broad-based, market-value-weighted indexes are computed daily. These include the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index, the NYSE index, the NASDAQ index, the Wilshire 5000 index, and indexes of many non-U.S. stock markets.  \n    8 .   A call option is a right to purchase an asset at a stipulated exercise price on or before an expiration date. A put option is the right to sell an asset at some exercise price. Calls increase in value while puts decrease in value as the price of the underlying asset increases.  \n    9 .   A futures contract is an obligation to buy or sell an asset at a stipulated futures price on a maturity date. The long position, which commits to purchasing, gains if the asset value increases while the short position, which commits to delivering, loses.

At what tax bracket (marginal tax rate) would an investor be indifferent between the two bonds?    \n \n E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES \n Barclays maintains a Web site at   www.barcap.com/inflation/index.shtml   with informa-\ntion about inflation around the world and tools to help issuers and investors understand \nthe inflation-linked asset class. Inflation-linked bonds were issued by a number of coun-tries after 1945, including Israel, Argentina, Brazil, and Iceland. However, the modern mar-ket is generally deemed to have been born in 1981, when the first index-linked gilts were issued in the U.K. The other large markets adopted somewhat different calculations to those used by the U.K., mostly copying the more straightforward model first employed by Canada in 1991. In chronological order, the markets are the U.K. (1981), Australia (1985), Canada (1991), Sweden (1994), the United States (1997), France (1998), Italy (2003), and Japan (2004). \n  SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS \n     1. The bid price of the bond is 138.0469% of par, or $1,380.469, and the ask price is 138.125% of \npar, or $1,381.25. This ask price corresponds to a yield of 2.378%. The ask price fell .9375 from \nits level yesterday, so the ask price then must have been 139.0625, or $1,390.625.  \n   2. A 6% taxable return is equivalent to an after-tax return of 6(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.30)\u00a0 5 \u00a04.2%. Therefore, you \nwould be better off in the taxable bond. The equivalent taxable yield of the tax-free bond is 4/(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.30)\u00a0 5 \u00a05.71%. So a taxable bond would have to pay a 5.71% yield to provide the same \nafter-tax return as a tax-free bond offering a 4% yield.  \n   3 .      a.   You are entitled to a prorated share of IBM\u2019s dividend payments and to vote in any of IBM\u2019s \nstockholder meetings.  \n    b.  Your potential gain is unlimited because IBM\u2019s stock price has no upper bound.  \n    c.  Your outlay was $180\u00a0 3 \u00a0100\u00a0 5 \u00a0$18,000. Because of limited liability, this is the most you can \nlose.     \n   4. The price-weighted index increases from 62.5 [i.e., (100\u00a0 1 \u00a025)/2] to 65 [i.e., (110\u00a0 1 \u00a020)/2], a \ngain of 4%. An investment of one share in each company requires an outlay of $125 that would increase in value to $130, for a return of 4% (i.e., 5/125), which equals the return to the price-weighted index.  \n   5. The market-value-weighted index return is calculated by computing the increase in the \nvalue of the stock portfolio. The portfolio of the two stocks starts with an initial value \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   57bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   57 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm5 8  PART I  Introduction\nof $100 million  1  $500 million  5  $600 million and falls in value to $110 million  1  \n$400 million  5  $510 million, a loss of 90/600  5  .15, or 15%. The index portfolio return is \na weighted average of the returns on each stock with weights of 1\u20446 on XYZ and 5\u20446 on ABC \n(weights proportional to relative investments). Because the return on XYZ is 10%, while \nthat on ABC is  2 20%, the index portfolio return is 1\u20446\u00a0 3 \u00a010%\u00a0 1  \u00a05\u20446\u00a0 3 \u00a0( 2 20%)\u00a0 5  \u00a0 2 15%, \nequal to the return on the market-value-weighted index.  \n   6. The payoff to the call option is $7 per share at expiration. The option cost is $5.50 per share. The \ndollar profit is therefore $1.50. The put option expires worthless. Therefore, the investor\u2019s loss is the cost of the put, or $2.11.      \nbod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   58bod61671_ch02_028-058.indd   58 6/18/13   7:41 PM6/18/13   7:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n3\n  THIS CHAPTER WILL\u00a0 provide you with a \nbroad introduction to the many venues and \nprocedures available for trading securities in the United States and international markets. We will see that trading mechanisms range from direct negotiation among market partic-ipants to fully automated computer crossing of trade orders. \n The first time a security trades is when it is \nissued to the public. Therefore, we begin with \na look at how securities are first marketed to the public by investment bankers, the midwives of securities. We turn next to a broad survey of how already-issued  securities may be traded among investors, focusing on the  differences between dealer markets,  electronic markets, and specialist markets. With this background, we consider specific trading arenas such as the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and sev-eral all-electronic markets. We compare the mechanics of trade execution and the impact of cross-market integration of trading. \n We then turn to the essentials of some \nspecific types of transactions, such as buying \non margin and short-selling stocks. We close the chapter with a look at some important aspects of the regulations governing security trading, including insider trading laws and the role of security markets as self-regulating organizations.   How Securities \nAre Traded  CHAPTER THREE \n    3.1 How Firms Issue Securities  \n Firms regularly need to raise new capital to help pay for their many investment projects. \nBroadly speaking, they can raise funds either by borrowing money or by selling shares in the firm. Investment bankers are generally hired to manage the sale of these securities in what is called a    primary market    for newly issued securities. Once these securities are \nissued, however, investors might well wish to trade them among themselves. For example, you may decide to raise cash by selling some of your shares in Apple to another investor. This transaction would have no impact on the total outstanding number of Apple shares. Trades in existing securities take place in the    secondary market.    \n Shares of  publicly listed  firms trade continually on well-known markets such as the \nNew York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. There, any investor can choose to buy shares for his or her portfolio. These companies are also called  publicly traded, \npublicly owned,  or just  public companies.  Other firms, however, are  private corporations,  3 PART I \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   59bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   59 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 0  PART I  Introduction\nwhose shares are held by small numbers of managers and investors. While ownership \nstakes in the firm are still determined in proportion to share ownership, those shares do not trade in public exchanges. While many private firms are relatively young companies that have not yet chosen to make their shares generally available to the public, others may be more established firms that are still largely owned by the company\u2019s founders or families, and others may simply have decided that private organization is preferable.  \n   Privately Held Firms \n A privately held company is owned by a relatively small number of shareholders. Privately held firms have fewer obligations to release financial statements and other information to the public. This saves money and frees the firm from disclosing information that might be helpful to its competitors. Some firms also believe that eliminating requirements for quar-terly earnings announcements gives them more flexibility to pursue long-term goals free of shareholder pressure. \n At the moment, however, privately held firms may have only up to 499 shareholders. \nThis limits their ability to raise large amounts of capital from a wide base of investors. Thus, almost all of the largest companies in the U.S. are public corporations. \n When private firms wish to raise funds, they sell shares directly to a small number of \ninstitutional or wealthy investors in a    private placement.    Rule 144A of the SEC allows \nthem to make these placements without preparing the extensive and costly registration statements required of a public company. While this is attractive, shares in privately held firms do not trade in secondary markets such as a stock exchange, and this greatly reduces their liquidity and presumably reduces the prices that investors will pay for them.  Liquidity  \nhas many specific meanings, but generally speaking, it refers to the ability to buy or sell an asset at a fair price on short notice. Investors demand price concessions to buy illiquid securities. \n As firms increasingly chafe against the informational requirements of going public, \nfederal regulators have come under pressure to loosen the constraints entailed by private ownership, and they are currently reconsidering some of the restrictions on private com-panies. They may raise beyond 499 the number of shareholders that private firms can have before they are required to disclose financial information, and they may make it easier to publicize share offerings. \n Trading in private corporations also has evolved in recent years. To get around the \n499-investor restriction, middlemen have formed partnerships to buy shares in private companies; the partnership counts as only one investor, even though many individuals may participate in it. \n Very recently, some firms have set up computer networks to enable holders of private-\ncompany stock to trade among themselves. However, unlike the public stock markets reg-ulated by the SEC, these networks require little disclosure of financial information and provide correspondingly little oversight of the operations of the market. For example, in the run-up to its 2012 IPO, Facebook enjoyed huge valuations in these markets, but skep-tics worried that investors in these markets could not obtain a clear view of the firm, the interest among other investors in the firm, or the process by which trades in the firm\u2019s shares were executed.  \n  Publicly Traded Companies \n When a private firm decides that it wishes to raise capital from a wide range of inves-tors, it may decide to  go public.  This means that it will sell its securities to the general \npublic and allow those investors to freely trade those shares in established securities \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   60bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   60 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded 61\nmarkets. The first issue of shares to the general public is called the firm\u2019s    initial public \noffering,  or  IPO.    Later, the firm may go back to the public and issue additional shares. \nA  seasoned equity offering   is the sale of additional shares in firms that already are pub-\nlicly traded. For example, a sale by Apple of new shares of stock would be considered a \nseasoned new issue. \n Public offerings of both stocks and bonds typically are marketed by investment  bankers \nwho in this role are called    underwriters.    More than one investment banker usually  markets \nthe securities. A lead firm forms an underwriting syndicate of other investment bankers to \nshare the responsibility for the stock issue. \n Investment bankers advise the firm regarding the terms on which it should attempt to \nsell the securities. A preliminary registration statement must be filed with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission (SEC), describing the issue and the prospects of the \n company. When the statement is in final form and accepted by the SEC, it is called the \n   prospectus.    At this point, the price at which the securities will be offered to the public \nis announced. \n In a typical underwriting arrangement, the investment bankers purchase the securities \nfrom the issuing company and then resell them to the public. The issuing firm sells the \nsecurities to the underwriting syndicate for the public offering price less a spread that \nserves as compensation to the underwriters. This procedure is called a  firm commitment.   In \naddition to the spread, the investment banker also may receive shares of common stock or \nother securities of the firm.  Figure\u00a03.1  depicts the relationships among the firm issuing the \nsecurity, the lead underwriter, the underwriting syndicate, and the public.      \n  Shelf Registration \n An important innovation in the issuing of securities \nwas introduced in 1982 when the SEC approved Rule \n415, which allows firms to register securities and grad-\nually sell them to the public for 2 years following the \ninitial registration. Because the securities are already \n registered, they can be sold on short notice, with little \nadditional paperwork. Moreover, they can be sold \nin small amounts without incur-\nring substantial flotation costs. \nThe securities are \u201con the shelf,\u201d \nready to be issued, which has \ngiven rise to the term  shelf \nregistration.     \n  Initial Public Offerings \n Investment bankers manage the \nissuance of new securities to \nthe public. Once the SEC has \ncommented on the registration \nstatement and a preliminary \nprospectus has been distrib-\nuted to interested investors, the \ninvest ment bankers organize \n road shows   in which they travel \naround the country to publicize \nFigure 3.1 Relationships among a firm issuing securities, the under-\nwriters, and the public\nIssuing\nFirm\nLead Underwriter\nInvestment\nBanker A\nPrivate InvestorsInvestment\nBanker DInvestment\nBanker BInvestment\nBanker C\nUnderwriting\nSyndicate Why does it make sense for shelf registration to \nbe limited in time?

These road shows serve two purposes. First, they generate interest \namong potential investors and provide information about the offering. Second, they pro-vide  information to the issuing firm and its underwriters about the price at which they will be able to market the securities. Large investors  communicate their interest in purchasing shares of the IPO to the underwriters; these indications of interest are called a  book  and \nthe process of polling potential investors is called  bookbuilding.  The book provides valu-\nable information to the issuing firm because institutional investors often will have useful insights about the market demand for the security as well as the prospects of the firm and its competitors. Investment bankers frequently revise both their initial estimates of the offering price of a security and the number of shares offered based on feedback from the investing community. \n Why do investors truthfully reveal their interest in an offering to the investment \nbanker? Might they be better off expressing little interest, in the hope that this will drive down the offering price? Truth is the better policy in this case because truth telling is rewarded. Shares of IPOs are allocated across investors in part based on the strength of each investor\u2019s expressed interest in the offering. If a firm wishes to get a large allocation when it is optimistic about the security, it needs to reveal its optimism. In turn, the underwriter needs to offer the security at a bargain price to these investors to induce them to participate in bookbuilding and share their information. Thus, IPOs commonly are underpriced compared to the price at which they could be marketed. Such underpricing is reflected in price jumps that occur on the date when the shares are first traded in public security markets. The November 2011 IPO of Groupon was a typical example of underpricing. The company issued about 35 million shares to the public at a price of $20. The stock price closed that day at $26.11, a bit more than 30% above the offering price. \n While the explicit costs of an IPO tend to be around 7% of the funds raised, such under-\npricing should be viewed as another cost of the issue. For example, if Groupon had sold its shares for the $26.11 that investors obviously were willing to pay for them, its IPO would have raised 30% more money than it actually did. The money \u201cleft on the table\u201d in this case far exceeded the explicit cost of the stock issue. Nevertheless, underpricing seems to be a universal phenomenon.  Figure\u00a03.2  presents average first-day returns on IPOs of stocks across the world. The results consistently indicate that IPOs are marketed to investors at attractive prices.  \n   \n Pricing of IPOs is not trivial and not all IPOs turn out to be underpriced. Some do \npoorly after issue. Facebook\u2019s 2012 IPO was a notable disappointment. Within a week of its IPO, Facebook\u2019s share price was 15% below the $38 offer price, and five months later, its shares were selling at about half the offer price. \n Interestingly, despite their typically attractive first-day returns, IPOs have been poor \nlong-term investments. Ritter calculates the returns to a hypothetical investor who bought equal amounts of each U.S. IPO between 1980 and 2009 at the close of trading on the first day the stock was listed and held each position for three years. That portfolio would have underperformed the broad U.S. stock market on average by 19.8% for three-year holding periods and underperformed \u201cstyle-matched\u201d portfolios of firms with comparable size and ratio of book value to market value by 7.3%.  \n1   Other IPOs cannot even be fully \nsold to the market. Underwriters left with unmarketable securities are forced to sell them at a loss on the secondary market. Therefore, the investment banker bears price risk for an  underwritten issue.     \n  1 Professor Jay Ritter\u2019s Web site contains a wealth of information and data about IPOs:   http://bear.warrington.\nufl.edu/ritter/ipodata.htm.   \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   62bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   62 7/25/13   2:14 AM7/25/13   2:14 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded 63\n0%25%50%75%100%Average First-Day Returns125%150%175%\nArgentina\nRussia\nCanada\nAustria\nChile\nDenmark\nNorway\nNetherlands\nTurkey\nFrance\nTurkey\nSpain\nNigeria\nPortugal\nIsrael\nBelgium\nMexico\nHong Kong\nIsrael\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\nFinland\nAustralia\nIndonesia\nNew Zealand\nPhilipines\nIran\nItaly\nPoland\nCyprus\nIreland\nGreece\nGermany\nSingapore\nSweden\nSouth Africa\nThailand\nTaiwan\nJapan\nBrazil\nKorea\nMalaysia\nIndia\nChina\nFigure 3.2 Average first-day returns on IPOs from around the world\n Source: Provided by Professor J.

Consider what would \nhappen if organized markets did not exist. Any household wishing to invest in some type \nof financial asset would have to find others wishing to sell. Soon, venues where interested \ntraders could meet would become popular. Eventually, financial markets would emerge \nfrom these meeting places. Thus, a pub in old London called Lloyd\u2019s launched the mari-\ntime insurance industry. A Manhattan curb on Wall Street became synonymous with the \nfinancial world.  \n   Types of Markets \n We can differentiate four types of markets: direct search markets, brokered markets, dealer \nmarkets, and auction markets. \n  Direct Search Markets   A  direct search market   is the least organized market.  Buyers \nand sellers must seek each other out directly. An example of a transaction in such a market \nis the sale of a used refrigerator where the seller advertises for buyers in a local newspaper \nor on Craigslist. Such markets are characterized by sporadic participation and low-priced \nand nonstandard goods. Firms would find it difficult to profit by specializing in such an \nenvironment.  \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   63bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   63 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 4  PART I  Introduction\n  Brokered Markets   The next level of organization is a  brokered market.  In markets \nwhere trading in a good is active, brokers find it profitable to offer search services to buyers \nand sellers. A good example is the real estate market, where economies of scale in searches for available homes and for prospective buyers make it worthwhile for participants to pay brokers to help them conduct the searches. Brokers in particular markets develop special-ized knowledge on valuing assets traded in that market. \n Notice that the  primary market,  where new issues of securities are offered to the public, \nis an example of a brokered market. In the primary market, investment bankers who market a firm\u2019s securities to the public act as brokers; they seek investors to purchase securities directly from the issuing corporation.  \n  Dealer Markets   When trading activity in a particular type of asset increases,    dealer \nmarkets    arise. Dealers specialize in various assets, purchase these assets for their own \naccounts, and later sell them for a profit from their inventory. The spreads between dealers\u2019 buy (or \u201cbid\u201d) prices and sell (or \u201cask\u201d) prices are a source of profit. Dealer markets save traders on search costs because market participants can easily look up the prices at which they can buy from or sell to dealers. A fair amount of market activity is required before dealing in a market is an attractive source of income. Most bonds trade in over-the-counter dealer markets.  \n  Auction Markets   The most integrated market is an    auction market,    in which all \ntraders converge at one place (either physically or \u201celectronically\u201d) to buy or sell an \nasset. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is an example of an auction market. An advantage of auction markets over dealer markets is that one need not search across dealers to find the best price for a good. If all participants converge, they can arrive at mutually agreeable prices and save the bid\u2013ask spread. \n Notice that both over-the-counter dealer markets and stock exchanges are secondary \nmarkets. They are organized for investors to trade existing securities among themselves.    \n  Types of Orders \n Before comparing alternative trading practices and com-peting security markets, it is helpful to begin with an overview of the types of trades an investor might wish to have executed in these markets. Broadly speaking, there are two types of orders: market orders and orders contin-gent on price. \n  Market Orders   Market orders are buy or sell orders \nthat are to be executed immediately at current market \nprices. For example, our investor might call her broker and \nask for the market price of FedEx. The broker might report back that the best    bid price    is $90 \nand the best    ask price    is $90.05, meaning that the investor would need to pay $90.05 to pur-\nchase a share, and could receive $90 a share if she wished to sell some of her own holdings of FedEx. The    bid\u2013ask spread    in this case is $.05. So an order to buy 100 shares \u201cat market\u201d \nwould result in purchase at $90.05, and an order to \u201csell at market\u201d would be executed at $90. \n This simple scenario is subject to a few potential complications. First, the posted price \nquotes actually represent commitments to trade up to a specified number of shares. If the market order is for more than this number of shares, the order may be filled at  multiple prices. For example, if the ask price is good for orders up to 1,000 shares, and the  investor wishes to purchase 1,500 shares, it may be necessary to pay a slightly higher price for the last 500 shares.  Figure\u00a03.3  shows the average  depth   of the markets for shares of stock (i.e., the total  Many assets trade in more than one type of \n market.

Notice that depth \nis considerably higher for the large stocks in \nthe S&P 500 than for the smaller stocks that \nconstitute the Russell 2000 index. Depth is \nconsidered another component of liquidity. \nSecond, another trader may beat our investor \nto the quote, meaning that her order would \nthen be executed at a worse price. Finally, \nthe best price quote may change before her \norder arrives, again causing execution at a \nprice different from the one at the moment \nof the order.       \n  Price-Contingent Orders   Investors \nalso may place orders specifying prices \nat which they are willing to buy or sell a \nsecurity. A limit buy order may instruct the \nbroker to buy some number of shares if and \nwhen FedEx may be obtained  at or below   \na stipulated price. Conversely, a limit sell \ninstructs the broker to sell if and when the \nstock price rises  above   a specified limit. A \ncollection of    limit orders    waiting to be exe-\ncuted is called a  limit order book.   \n  Figure\u00a03.4  is a portion of the limit order \nbook for shares in FedEx taken from the \nBidFDX FedEx Corporation\nFDX Go>>\nARCA\nARCA\nARCA\nARCA\nARCA90.04\n90.03\n90.02\n90.00\n89.9914:05:22\n14:05:25\n14:05:25\n14:05:18\n14:05:21NYSE Arca.\nID Price Size TimeAsk\nARCA\nARCA\nARCA\nARCA\nARCA90.05\n90.06\n90.07\n90.09\n90.10400\n104\n303\n303\n40414:05:21\n14:05:21\n14:05:21\n14:05:18ARCA 90.01 14:05:17 ARCA 90.08 303 14:05:18\nARCA 89.98 14:05:14 ARCA 90.11 404 14:04:00\nARCA 89.97100\n302\n204\n302\n4031604\n1003\n1103 14:05:20 ARCA 90.12 802 14:05:2314:04:55ID Price Size Time\nFigure 3.4 The limit order book for FedEx on the NYSE Arca market\n Source: New York Stock Exchange Euronext,   www.nyse.com   , June 22, 2012. \nFigure 3.3 Average market depth for large (S&P 500) and \nsmall (Russell 2000) firms\n Source: James J.

You want to buy shares of FedEx, to diversify your portfolio. You believe the share price is approxi-\nmately at the \u201cfair\u201d value, and you want the trade done quickly and cheaply.  \n   b. You want to buy shares of FedEx, but believe that the current stock price is too high given the firm\u2019s \nprospects. If the shares could be obtained at a price 5% lower than the current value, you would like \nto purchase shares for your portfolio.  \n   c. You plan to purchase a condominium sometime in the next month or so and will sell your shares of \nIntel to provide the funds for your down payment. While you believe that the Intel share price is \ngoing to rise over the next few weeks, if you are wrong and the share price drops suddenly, you will \nnot be able to afford the purchase. Therefore, you want to hold on to the shares for as long as pos-\nsible, but still protect yourself against the risk of a big loss.    CONCEPT CHECK 3.3 \n  Trading Mechanisms \n An investor who wishes to buy or sell shares will place an order with a brokerage firm. \nThe broker charges a commission for arranging the trade on the client\u2019s behalf. Brokers \nhave several avenues by which they can execute that trade, that is, find a buyer or seller and \narrange for the shares to be exchanged. \n Broadly speaking, there are three trading systems employed in the United States: over-\nthe-counter dealer markets, electronic communication networks, and specialist markets. \nThe best-known markets such as NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange actually use \na variety of trading procedures, so before you delve into specific markets, it is useful to \nunderstand the basic operation of each type of trading system. \nBuy\nSellPrice above\nthe LimitPrice below\nthe Limit\nLimit-Buy\nOrder\nLimit-Sell\nOrderStop-Buy\nOrder\nStop-Loss\nOrderActionCondition\n Figure 3.5 Price-contingent orders NYSE Arca exchange (one of several electronic exchanges; more on \nthese shortly). Notice that the best orders are at the top of the list: \nthe offers to buy at the highest price and to sell at the lowest price. \nThe buy and sell orders at the top of the list\u2014$90.04 and $90.05\u2014\nare called the  inside quotes;   they are the highest buy and lowest sell \norders. For FedEx, the inside spread at this time was only 1 cent. \nNote, however, that order sizes at the inside quotes can be fairly \nsmall. Therefore, investors interested in larger trades face an  effective\nspread greater than the nominal one because they cannot execute their \nentire trades at the inside price quotes.     \n    Stop orders    are similar to limit orders in that the trade is not to \nbe executed unless the stock hits a price limit. For  stop-loss orders,\nthe stock is to be  sold  if its price falls  below   a stipulated level. As \nthe name suggests, the order lets the stock be sold to stop further \nlosses from accumulating. Similarly,  stop-buy orders   specify that \na stock should be bought when its price rises above a limit. These trades often accom-\npany  short sales   (sales of securities you don\u2019t own but have borrowed from your broker) \nand are used to limit potential losses from the short position. Short sales are discussed \nin greater detail later in this chapter.  Figure\u00a0 3.5  organizes these types of trades in a \n convenient matrix.       \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   66bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   66 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded  67\n  Dealer Markets   Roughly 35,000 securities trade on the    over-the-counter  or  OTC \nmarket.    Thousands of brokers register with the SEC as security dealers. Dealers quote \nprices at which they are willing to buy or sell securities. A broker then executes a trade by contacting a dealer listing an attractive quote. \n Before 1971, all OTC quotations were recorded manually and published daily on so-\ncalled pink sheets. In 1971, the National Association of Securities Dealers introduced its Automatic Quotations System, or NASDAQ, to link brokers and dealers in a computer network where price quotes could be displayed and revised. Dealers could use the network to display the bid price at which they were willing to purchase a security and the ask price at which they were willing to sell. The difference in these prices, the bid\u2013ask spread, was the source of the dealer\u2019s profit. Brokers representing clients could examine quotes over the computer network, contact the dealer with the best quote, and execute a trade. \n As originally organized, NASDAQ was more of a price-quotation system than a trading \nsystem. While brokers could survey bid and ask prices across the network of dealers in the search for the best trading opportunity, actual trades required direct negotiation (often over the phone) between the investor\u2019s broker and the dealer in the security. However, as we will see, NASDAQ is no longer a mere price quotation system. While dealers still post bid and ask prices over the network, what is now called the  NASDAQ Stock Market  allows for \nelectronic execution of trades, and the vast majority of trades are executed electronically.  \n  Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)   Electronic communication \nnetworks allow participants to post market and limit orders over computer networks. The \nlimit-order book is available to all participants. An example of such an order book from NYSE Arca, one of the leading ECNs, appears in  Figure\u00a03.4 . Orders that can be \u201ccrossed,\u201d that is, matched against another order, are done automatically without requiring the inter-vention of a broker. For example, an order to buy a share at a price of $50 or lower will be immediately executed if there is an outstanding ask price of $50. Therefore, ECNs are true trading systems, not merely price-quotation systems. \n ECNs offer several attractions. Direct crossing of trades without using a broker-dealer \nsystem eliminates the bid\u2013ask spread that otherwise would be incurred. Instead, trades are automatically crossed at a modest cost, typically less than a penny per share. ECNs are attractive as well because of the speed with which a trade can be executed. Finally, these systems offer investors considerable anonymity in their trades.  \n  Specialist Markets   Specialist systems have been largely replaced by electronic commu-\nnication networks, but as recently as a decade ago, they were still a dominant form of market \norganization for trading in stocks. In these systems, exchanges such as the NYSE assign respon-sibility for managing the trading in each security to a    specialist.    Brokers wishing to buy or sell \nshares for their clients direct the trade to the specialist\u2019s post on the floor of the exchange. While each security is assigned to only one specialist, each specialist firm makes a market in many securities. The specialist maintains the limit order book of all outstanding unexecuted limit orders. When orders can be executed at market prices, the specialist executes, or \u201ccrosses,\u201d the trade. The highest outstanding bid price and the lowest outstanding ask price \u201cwin\u201d the trade. \n Specialists are also mandated to maintain a \u201cfair and orderly\u201d market when the book of \nlimit buy and sell orders is so thin that the spread between the highest bid price and lowest ask price becomes too wide. In this case, the specialist firm would be expected to offer to buy and sell shares from its own inventory at a narrower bid-ask spread. In this role, the specialist serves as a dealer in the stock and provides liquidity to other traders. In this context, liquidity providers are those who stand willing to buy securities from or sell securities to other traders.     \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   67bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   67 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 8  PART I  Introduction\n   3.3 The Rise of Electronic Trading \n  When first established, NASDAQ was primarily an over-the-counter dealer market and \nthe NYSE was a specialist market. But today both are primarily electronic markets. These changes were driven by an interaction of new technologies and new regulations. New regu-lations allowed brokers to compete for business, broke the hold that dealers once had on information about best-available bid and ask prices, forced integration of markets, and allowed securities to trade in ever-smaller price increments (called  tick sizes ). Technology \nmade it possible for traders to rapidly compare prices across markets and direct their trades to the markets with the best prices. The resulting competition drove down the cost of trade execution to a tiny fraction of its value just a few decades ago. \n In 1975, fixed commissions on the NYSE were eliminated, which freed brokers to com-\npete for business by lowering their fees. In that year also, Congress amended the Securities Exchange Act to create the National Market System to at least partially centralize trading across exchanges and enhance competition among different market makers. The idea was to implement centralized reporting of transactions as well as a centralized price quotation system to give traders a broader view of trading opportunities across markets. \n The aftermath of a 1994 scandal at NASDAQ turned out to be a major impetus in the \nfurther evolution and integration of markets. NASDAQ dealers were found to be colluding to maintain wide bid-ask spreads. For example, if a stock was listed at $30 bid\u2014$30\n1/2 \nask, a retail client who wished to buy shares from a dealer would pay $301/2 while a client \nwho wished to sell shares would receive only $30. The dealer would pocket the 1/2-point \nspread as profit. Other traders may have been willing to step in with better prices (e.g., they may have been willing to buy shares for $30\n1/8 or sell them for $303/8), but those better \nquotes were not made available to the public, enabling dealers to profit from artificially wide spreads at the public\u2019s expense. When these practices came to light, an antitrust law-suit was brought against NASDAQ. \n In response to the scandal, the SEC instituted new order-handling rules. Published \ndealer quotes now had to reflect limit orders of customers, allowing them to effectively compete with dealers to capture trades. As part of the antitrust settlement, NASDAQ agreed to integrate quotes from ECNs into its public display, enabling the electronic exchanges to also compete for trades. Shortly after this settlement, the SEC adopted Regulation ATS (Alternative Trading Systems), giving ECNs the right to register as stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, they captured an ever-larger market share, and in the wake of this new compe-tition, bid\u2013ask spreads narrowed. \n Even more dramatic narrowing of trading costs came in 1997, when the SEC allowed \nthe minimum tick size to fall from one-eighth of a dollar to one-sixteenth. Not long after, in 2001, \u201cdecimalization\u201d allowed the tick size to fall to 1 cent. Bid\u2013ask spreads again fell dramatically.  Figure\u00a03.6  shows estimates of the \u201ceffective spread\u201d (the cost of a transac-tion) during three distinct time periods defined by the minimum tick size. Notice how dramatically effective spread falls along with the minimum tick size.    \n Technology was also changing trading practices. The first ECN, Instinet, was estab-\nlished in 1969. By the 1990s, exchanges around the world were rapidly adopting fully electronic trading systems. Europe led the way in this evolution, but eventually American exchanges followed suit. The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) spun off the NASDAQ Stock Market as a separate entity in 2000, which quickly evolved into a centralized limit-order matching system\u2014effectively a large ECN. The NYSE acquired the electronic Archipelago Exchange in 2006 and renamed it NYSE Arca. \n In 2005, the SEC adopted Regulation NMS (for National Market System), which was \nfully implemented in 2007. The goal was to link exchanges electronically, thereby  creating, \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   68bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   68 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded 69\nin effect, one integrated electronic market. The regulation required exchanges to honor \nquotes of other exchanges when they could be executed automatically. An exchange that \ncould not handle a quote electronically would be labeled a \u201cslow market\u201d under Reg NMS \nand could be ignored by other market participants. The NYSE, which was still devoted to \nthe specialist system, was particularly at risk of being passed over, and in response to this \npressure, it moved aggressively toward automated execution of trades. Electronic trading \nnetworks and the integration of markets in the wake of Reg NMS made it much easier for \nexchanges around the world to compete; the NYSE lost its effective monopoly in the trad-\ning of its own listed stocks, and by the end of the decade, its share in the trading of NYSE-\nlisted stocks fell from about 75% to 25%. \n While specialists still exist, trading today is overwhelmingly electronic, at least for \nstocks. Bonds are still traded in more traditional dealer markets. In the U.S., the share of \nelectronic trading in equities rose from about 16% in 2000 to over 80% by the end of the \ndecade. In the rest of the world, the dominance of electronic trading is even greater.   0.0000.0250.0500.0750.1000.1250.1500.1750.200\nJan-93\nJul-93\nJan-94\nJul-94\nJan-95\nJul-95\nJan-96\nJul-96\nJan-97\nJul-97\nJan-98\nJul-98\nJan-99\nJul-99\nJan-00\nJul-00\nJan-01\nJul-01\nJan-02\nJul-02\nJan-03Effective Spread ($)\nDecimal Regime Sixteenths Regime Eighths Regime\n Figure 3.6 The effective spread (measured in dollars per share) fell dramatically as the minimum tick \nsize fell (value-weighted average of NYSE-listed shares) \n Source: Tarun Chordia, Richard Roll, and Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, \u201cLiquidity and Market Efficiency,\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics   \n87 (2008), 249\u2013268.

It has steadily introduced ever-more \nsophisticated trading platforms, which today handle the great majority of its trades. The \ncurrent version, called the NASDAQ Market Center, consolidates NASDAQ\u2019s previous \nelectronic markets into one integrated system. NASDAQ merged in 2008 with OMX, a \nSwedish-Finnish company that controls seven Nordic and Baltic stock exchanges to form \nNASDAQ OMX Group. In addition to maintaining the NASDAQ Stock Market, it also \nmaintains several stock markets in Europe as well as an options and futures exchange in \nthe U.S. \n NASDAQ has three levels of subscribers. The highest, level 3 subscribers, are registered \nmarket makers. These are firms that make a market in securities, maintain inventories of \nsecurities, and post bid and ask prices at which they are willing to buy or sell shares. Level \n3 subscribers can enter and change bid\u2013ask quotes continually and have the fastest execu-\ntion of trades. They profit from the spread between bid and ask prices. \n Level 2 subscribers receive all bid and ask quotes but cannot enter their own quotes. \nThey can see which market makers are offering the best prices. These subscribers tend to \nbe brokerage firms that execute trades for clients but do not actively deal in stocks for their \nown account. \n Level 1 subscribers receive only inside quotes (i.e., the best bid and ask prices), but do \nnot see how many shares are being offered. These subscribers tend to be investors who are \nnot actively buying or selling but want information on current prices.   Figure 3.7 Market share of trading in NYSE-listed shares \n Source: James J.

Daily trading volume on the NYSE is about a billion shares. In 2006, the \nNYSE merged with the Archipelago Exchange to form a publicly held company called the NYSE Group, and then in 2007, it merged with the European exchange  Euronext to form NYSE Euronext. The firm acquired the American Stock Exchange in 2008, which has since been renamed NYSE Amex and focuses on small firms. NYSE Arca is the firm\u2019s electronic communications network, and this is where the bulk of exchange-traded funds trade. In 2012, NYSE Euronext agreed to be purchased by InternationalExchange (ICE), whose main business to date has been energy-futures trading. ICE plans to retain the NYSE Euronext name as well as the fabled trading floor on Wall Street. \n The NYSE was long committed to its specialist trading system, which relied heavily \non human participation in trade execution. It began its transition to electronic trading for smaller trades in 1976 with the introduction of its DOT (Designated Order Turnaround), and later SuperDOT systems, which could route orders directly to the specialist. In 2000, the exchange launched Direct 1 , which could automatically cross smaller trades (up to \n1,099 shares) without human intervention, and in 2004, it began eliminating the size restric-tions on Direct 1  trades. The change of emphasis dramatically accelerated in 2006 with the \nintroduction of the NYSE Hybrid Market, which allowed brokers to send orders either for immediate electronic execution or to the specialist, who could seek price improvement from another trader. The Hybrid system allowed the NYSE to qualify as a fast market for the purposes of Regulation NMS, but still offer the advantages of human intervention for more complicated trades. In contrast, NYSE\u2019s Arca marketplace is fully electronic.  \n  ECNs \n Over time, more fully automated markets have gained market share at the expense of less automated ones, in particular, the NYSE. Some of the biggest ECNs today are Direct Edge, BATS, and NYSE Arca. Brokers that have an affiliation with an ECN have computer access and can enter orders in the limit order book. As orders are received, the system determines whether there is a matching order, and if so, the trade is immediately crossed. \n Originally, ECNs were open only to other traders using the same system. But following \nthe implementation of Reg NMS, ECNs began listing limit orders on other networks. Traders could use their computer systems to sift through the limit order books of many ECNs and instantaneously route orders to the market with the best prices. Those cross-market links have become the impetus for one of the more popular strategies of so-called high-frequency trad-ers, which seek to profit from even small, transitory discrepancies in prices across markets. Speed is obviously of the essence here, and ECNs compete in terms of the speed they can offer.  Latency  refers to the time it takes to accept, process, and deliver a trading order. BATS, \nfor example, advertises latency times of around 200 microseconds, i.e., .0002 second.    \n   3.5 New Trading Strategies  \n The marriage of electronic trading mechanisms with computer technology has had far-ranging impacts on trading strategies and tools.  Algorithmic trading  delegates trading \ndecisions to computer programs.  High frequency trading  is a special class of algorith-\nmic trading in which computer programs initiate orders in tiny fractions of a second, far faster than any human could process the information driving the trade. Much of the \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   71bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   71 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n7 2  PART I  Introduction\nmarket liquidity that once was provided by brokers making a market in a security has been \n displaced by these high-frequency traders. But when high-frequency traders abandon the market, as in the so-called flash crash of 2010, liquidity can likewise evaporate in a flash.  Dark pools  are trading venues that preserve anonymity, but also affect market liquidity. We \nwill address these emerging issues later in this section.  \n   Algorithmic Trading \n  Algorithmic trading  is the use of computer programs to make trading decisions. Well more than half of all equity volume in the U.S. is believed to be initiated by computer algorithms. Many of these trades exploit very small discrepancies in security prices and entail numerous and rapid cross-market price comparisons that are well suited to com-puter analysis. These strategies would not have been feasible before decimalization of the  minimum tick size. \n Some algorithmic trades attempt to exploit very short-term trends (as short as a few \nseconds) as new information about a firm becomes reflected in its stock price. Others use versions of  pairs trading  in which normal price relations between pairs (or larger groups) \nof stocks seem temporarily disrupted and offer small profit opportunities as they move back into alignment. Still others attempt to exploit discrepancies between stock prices and prices of stock-index futures contracts. \n Some algorithmic trading involves activities akin to traditional market making. The \ntraders seek to profit from the bid\u2013ask spread by buying a stock at the bid price and rap-idly selling it at the ask price before the price can change. While this mimics the role of a market maker who provides liquidity to other traders in the stock, these algorithmic traders are not registered market makers and so do not have an affirmative obligation to maintain both bid and ask quotes. If they abandon a market during a period of turbulence, the shock to market liquidity can be disruptive. This seems to have been a problem during the flash crash of May 6, 2010, when the stock market encountered extreme volatility, with the Dow Jones average falling by 1,000 points before recovering around 600 points in intraday trad-ing. The nearby box discusses this amazing and troubling episode.  \n  High-Frequency Trading \n It is easy to see that many algorithmic trading strategies require extremely rapid trade initiation and execution.  High-frequency trading  is a subset of algorithmic trading that \nrelies on computer programs to make extremely rapid decisions. High-frequency traders compete for trades that offer very small profits. But if those opportunities are numerous enough, they can accumulate to big money. \n We pointed out that one high-frequency strategy entails a sort of market making, \nattempting to profit from the bid\u2013ask spread. Another relies on cross-market arbitrage, in which even tiny price discrepancies across markets allow the firm to buy a security at one price and simultaneously sell it at a slightly higher price. The competitive advantage in these strategies lies with the firms that are quickest to identify and execute these profit opportunities. There is a tremendous premium on being the first to \u201chit\u201d a bid or ask price. \n Trade execution times for high-frequency traders are now measured in milliseconds, \neven microseconds. This has induced trading firms to \u201cco-locate\u201d their trading centers next to the computer systems of the electronic exchanges. When execution or latency periods are less than a millisecond, the extra time it takes for a trade order to travel from a remote location to a New York exchange would be enough to make it nearly impossible to win the trade. \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   72bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   72 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded  73\n To understand why co-location has become a key issue, consider this calculation. \nEven light can travel only 186 miles in 1 millisecond, so an order originating in Chicago \ntransmitted at the speed of light would take almost 5 milliseconds to reach New York. But ECNs today claim latency periods considerably less than 1 millisecond, so an order from Chicago could not possibly compete with one launched from a co-located facility. \n In some ways, co-location is a new version of an old phenomenon. Think about why, \neven before the advent of the telephone, so many brokerage firms originally located their headquarters in New York: They were \u201cco-locating\u201d with the NYSE so that their brokers could bring trades to the exchange quickly and efficiently. Today, trades are transmitted electronically, but competition among traders for fast execution means that the need to be near the market (now embodied in computer servers) remains.  \n  Dark Pools \n Many large traders seek anonymity. They fear that if others see them executing a large buy or sell program, their intentions will become public and prices will move against them. Very large trades (called  blocks,  usually defined as a trade of more than 10,000 shares) \ntraditionally were brought to \u201cblock houses,\u201d brokerage firms specializing in matching block buyers and sellers. Part of the expertise of block brokers is in identifying trad-ers who might be interested in a large purchase or sale if given an offer. These brokers  discreetly arrange large trades out of the public eye, and so avoid moving prices against their clients. \n Block trading today has been displaced to a great extent by  dark pools,  trading systems \nin which participants can buy or sell large blocks of securities without showing their hand. Not only are buyers and sellers in dark pools hidden from the public, but even trades may not be reported, or if they are reported, they may be lumped with other trades to obscure information about particular participants. \n Dark pools are somewhat controversial because they contribute to the fragmentation \nof markets. When many orders are removed from the consolidated limit order book, there are fewer orders left to absorb fluctuations in demand for the security, and the public price may no longer be \u201cfair\u201d in the sense that it reflects all the potentially available information about security demand. \n Another approach to dealing with large trades is to split them into many small trades, \neach of which can be executed on electronic markets, attempting to hide the fact that the total number of shares ultimately to be bought or sold is large. This trend has led to rapid decline in average trade size, which today is less than 300 shares.   \n  Bond Trading \n In 2006, the NYSE obtained regulatory approval to expand its bond-trading system to include the debt issues of any NYSE-listed firm. Until then, each bond needed to be regis-tered before listing, and such a requirement was too onerous to justify listing most bonds. In conjunction with these new listings, the NYSE has expanded its electronic bond-trading platform, which is now called NYSE Bonds and is the largest centralized bond market of any U.S. exchange. \n Nevertheless, the vast majority of bond trading occurs in the OTC market among bond \ndealers, even for bonds that are actually listed on the NYSE. This market is a network of bond dealers such as Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America), Salomon Smith Barney (a division of Citigroup), and Goldman Sachs that is linked by a computer quotation \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   73bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   73 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n74system. However, because these dealers do not carry extensive inventories of the wide \nrange of bonds that have been issued to the public, they cannot necessarily offer to sell bonds from their inventory to clients or even buy bonds for their own inventory. They may instead work to locate an investor who wishes to take the opposite side of a trade. In practice, however, the corporate bond market often is quite \u201cthin,\u201d in that there may be few investors interested in trading a specific bond at any particular time. As a result, the bond market is subject to a type of liquidity risk, for it can be difficult to sell one\u2019s holdings quickly if the need arises.    \n   3.6 Globalization of Stock Markets \n   Figure\u00a03.8  shows that NYSE-Euronext is by far the largest equity market as measured by the total market value of listed firms. All major stock markets today are effectively electronic.     \n Securities markets have come under increasing pressure in recent years to make inter-\nnational alliances or mergers. Much of this pressure is due to the impact of electronic trading. To a growing extent, traders view stock markets as computer networks that link them to other traders, and there are increasingly fewer limits on the securities around the world that they can trade. Against this background, it becomes more important for exchanges to provide the cheapest and most efficient mechanism by which trades can be executed and cleared. This argues for global alliances that can facilitate the nuts and bolts of cross-border trading and can benefit from economies of scale. Exchanges feel that they   The Flash Crash of May 2010 \n At 2:42 New York time on May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average was already down about 300 points for the day. The market was demonstrating concerns about the European debt crisis, and nerves were already on edge. Then, in the next 5 minutes, the Dow dropped an   additional  600 points. And only 20 minutes after that, it \nhad recovered most of those 600 points. Besides the stag-\ngering intraday volatility of the broad market, trading in individual shares and ETFs was even more disrupted. The iShares Russell 1000 Value fund temporarily fell from $59 a share to 8 cents. Shares in the large consulting company Accenture, which had just sold for $38, traded at 1 cent only a minute or two later. At the other extreme, share prices of Apple and Hewlett-Packard momentarily increased to over $100,000. These markets were clearly broken. \n The causes of the flash crash are still debated. An SEC \nreport issued after the trade points to a $4 billion sale \nof market index futures contracts by a mutual fund. As market prices began to tumble, many algorithmic trad-ing programs withdrew from the markets, and those that remained became net sellers, further pushing down equity prices. As more and more of these algorithmic traders shut down, liquidity in these markets evaporated: Buyers for many stocks simply disappeared.  WORDS FROM THE STREET  Finally, trading was halted for a short period. When \nit resumed, buyers decided to take advantage of many \nseverely depressed stock prices, and the market rebounded almost as quickly as it had crashed. Given the intra-day turbulence and the clearly distorted prices at which some trades had been executed, the NYSE and NASDAQ decided to cancel all trades that were executed more than 60% away from a \u201creference price\u201d close to the opening price of the day. Almost 70% of those canceled trades involved ETFs. \n The SEC has since approved experimentation with new \ncircuit breakers to halt trading for 5 minutes in large stocks \nthat rise or fall by more than 10% in a 5-minute period. The idea is to prevent trading algorithms from moving share prices quickly before human traders have a chance to determine whether those prices are moving in response to fundamental information. \n The flash crash highlighted the fragility of markets in \nthe face of huge variation in trading volume created \nby algorithmic traders. The potential for these  high-\nfrequency traders to withdraw from markets in periods of turbulence remains a concern, and many observers are not convinced that we are protected from future flash crashes.  \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   74bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   74 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded  75\neventually need to offer 24-hour global markets and platforms that allow trading of differ-\nent security types, for example, both stocks and derivatives. Finally, companies want to be \nable to go beyond national borders when they wish to raise capital. \n These pressures have resulted in a broad trend toward market consolidation. In the \nlast decade, most of the mergers were \u201clocal,\u201d that is, involving exchanges operating on \nthe same continent. In the U.S., the NYSE merged with the Archipelago ECN in 2006, \nand in 2008 acquired the American Stock Exchange. NASDAQ acquired Instinet (which \noperated another major ECN, INET) in 2005 and the Boston Stock Exchange in 2007. \nIn the  derivatives market, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange acquired the Chicago Board \nof Trade in 2007 and the New York Mercantile Exchange in 2008, thus moving almost all \nfutures trading in the U.S. onto one exchange. In Europe, Euronext was formed by the \nmerger of the Paris, Brussels, Lisbon, and Amsterdam exchanges and shortly thereafter \npurchased Liffe, the derivatives exchange based in London. The LSE merged in 2007 with \nBorsa Italiana, which operates the Milan exchange. \n There has also been a wave of intercontinental consolidation. The NYSE Group and \nEuronext merged in 2007. Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the NYSE Euronext agreed \nto merge in late 2011. The merged firm would be able to support trading in virtually \nevery type of investment. However, in early 2012, the proposed merger ran aground when \nEuropean Union antitrust regulators recommended that the combination be blocked.

The NYSE and the Tokyo stock exchange have announced their \n intention to link their networks to give customers of each access to both markets. In 2007, the NASDAQ Stock Market merged with OMX, which operates seven Nordic and Baltic stock exchanges, to form NASDAQ OMX Group. In 2008, Eurex took over International Securities Exchange (ISE), to form a major options exchange.   \n   3.7 Trading Costs \n  Part of the cost of trading a security is obvious and explicit. Your broker must be paid a commission. Individuals may choose from two kinds of brokers: full-service or discount brokers. Full-service brokers who provide a variety of services often are referred to as account executives or financial consultants. \n Besides carrying out the basic services of executing orders, holding securities for safe-\nkeeping, extending margin loans, and facilitating short sales, brokers routinely provide information and advice relating to investment alternatives. \n Full-service brokers usually depend on a research staff that prepares analyses and \n forecasts of general economic as well as industry and company conditions and often makes specific buy or sell recommendations. Some customers take the ultimate leap of faith and allow a full-service broker to make buy and sell decisions for them by establishing a  discretionary account.  In this account, the broker can buy and sell prespecified securi-\nties whenever deemed fit. (The broker cannot withdraw any funds, though.) This action requires an unusual degree of trust on the part of the customer, for an unscrupulous broker can \u201cchurn\u201d an account, that is, trade securities excessively with the sole purpose of gen-erating commissions. \n Discount brokers, on the other hand, provide \u201cno-frills\u201d services. They buy and sell \nsecurities, hold them for safekeeping, offer margin loans, facilitate short sales, and that is all. The only information they provide about the securities they handle is price quota-tions. Discount brokerage services have become increasingly available in recent years. Many banks, thrift institutions, and mutual fund management companies now offer such services to the investing public as part of a general trend toward the creation of one-stop \u201cfinancial supermarkets.\u201d Stock trading fees have fallen steadily over the last decade, and discount brokerage firms such as Schwab, E*Trade, or TD Ameritrade now offer commis-sions below $10. \n In addition to the explicit part of trading costs\u2014the broker\u2019s commission\u2014there is an \nimplicit part\u2014the dealer\u2019s bid\u2013ask spread. Sometimes the broker is also a dealer in the security being traded and charges no commission but instead collects the fee entirely in the form of the bid\u2013ask spread. Another implicit cost of trading that some observers would distinguish is the price concession an investor may be forced to make for trading in quanti-ties greater than those associated with the posted bid or ask price.   \n   3.8 Buying on Margin \n  When purchasing securities, investors have easy access to a source of debt financing called  broker\u2019s call loans.  The act of taking advantage of broker\u2019s call loans is called  buying \non margin.  \n Purchasing stocks on margin means the investor borrows part of the purchase price of \nthe stock from a broker. The  margin  in the account is the portion of the purchase price \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   76bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   76 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded  77\n The percentage margin is defined as the ratio of the net worth, or the \u201cequity value,\u201d of \nthe account to the market value of the securities. To demonstrate, suppose an investor initially pays $6,000 toward the purchase of $10,000 worth of stock (100 shares at $100 per share), borrowing the remaining $4,000 from a broker. The initial balance sheet looks like this: \nAssets Liabilities and Owners\u2019 Equity\nValue of stock $10,000 Loan from broker $4,000\nEquity $6,000\n The initial percentage margin is   \nMargin 5Equity in account\nValue of stock5$6,000\n$10,0005.60, or 60%   \n If the price declines to $70 per share, the account balance becomes: \nAssets Liabilities and Owners\u2019 Equity\nValue of stock $7,000 Loan from broker $4,000\nEquity $3,000\n The assets in the account fall by the full decrease in the stock value, as does the equity. \nThe percentage margin is now\n   Margin 5Equity in account\nValue of stock5$3,000\n$7,0005.43, or 43%    Example 3.1 Margin contributed by the investor; the remainder is borrowed from the broker. The brokers in \nturn borrow money from banks at the call money rate to finance these purchases; they then charge their clients that rate (defined in Chapter 2), plus a service charge for the loan. All securities purchased on margin must be maintained with the brokerage firm in street name, for the securities are collateral for the loan. \n The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System limits the extent to which stock \npurchases can be financed using margin loans. The current initial margin requirement is 50%, meaning that at least 50% of the purchase price must be paid for in cash, with the rest borrowed. \n  If the stock value in Example 3.1 were to fall below $4,000, owners\u2019 equity would \nbecome negative, meaning the value of the stock is no longer sufficient collateral to cover the loan from the broker. To guard against this possibility, the broker sets a  maintenance \nmargin.  If the percentage margin falls below the maintenance level, the broker will issue a  margin call,  which requires the investor to add new cash or securities to the margin \naccount. If the investor does not act, the broker may sell securities from the account to pay off enough of the loan to restore the percentage margin to an acceptable level.  \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   77bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   77 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n eXcel APPLICATIONS: Buying on Margin \n The Online Learning Center (  www.mhhe.com/bkm  ) con-\ntains the Excel spreadsheet model below, which makes \nit easy to analyze the impacts of different margin levels \nand the volatility of stock prices.

What will the rate of return be if the price of FinCorp goes up by 30%? If it goes down by 30%? If it \nremains unchanged?  CONCEPT CHECK 3.5    Why do investors buy securities on margin? They do so when they wish to invest an \namount greater than their own money allows. Thus, they can achieve greater upside poten-\ntial, but they also expose themselves to greater downside risk. \n To see how, let\u2019s suppose an investor is bullish on FinCorp stock, which is selling for \n$100 per share. An investor with $10,000 to invest expects FinCorp to go up in price by \n30%  during the next year. Ignoring any dividends, the expected rate of return would be \n30% if the investor invested $10,000 to buy 100 shares. \n But now assume the investor borrows another $10,000 from the broker and invests \nit in FinCorp, too. The total investment in FinCorp would be $20,000 (for 200 shares). \nAssuming an interest rate on the margin loan of 9% per year, what will the investor\u2019s rate \nof return be now (again ignoring dividends) if FinCorp stock goes up 30% by year\u2019s end? \n The 200 shares will be worth $26,000. Paying off $10,900 of principal and interest on \nthe margin loan leaves $15,100 (i.e., $26,000\u00a0 2 \u00a0$10,900). The rate of return in this case \nwill be\n   $15,000 2$10,000\n$10,000551% \n  The investor has parlayed a 30% rise in the stock\u2019s price into a 51% rate of return on the \n$10,000 investment. \n Doing so, however, magnifies the downside risk. Suppose that, instead of going up \nby 30%, the price of FinCorp stock goes down by 30% to $70 per share. In that case, the \n200 shares will be worth $14,000, and the investor is left with $3,100 after paying off the \n$10,900 of principal and interest on the loan. The result is a disastrous return of\n   $3,100 2$10,000\n$10,00052 69% \n   Table\u00a03.1  summarizes the possible results of these hypothetical transactions.

In a naked short, a trader sells shares that have not \nyet been borrowed, assuming that the shares can be acquired in time to meet any delivery deadline. While naked \nshort-selling is prohibited, enforcement has been spotty, as many firms have engaged in it based on their \u201creason-able belief \u201d that they will be able to acquire the stock by the time delivery is required. Now the SEC is requiring that short-sellers have made firm arrangements for delivery before engaging in the sale.   Normally, an investor would first buy a stock and later sell it. With a short sale, the order \nis reversed. First, you sell and then you buy the shares. In both cases, you begin and end with no shares. \n A  short sale  allows investors to profit from a decline in a security\u2019s price. An investor \nborrows a share of stock from a broker and sells it. Later, the short-seller must purchase a share of the same stock in order to replace the share that was borrowed. This is called  covering the short position.   Table\u00a03.2  compares stock purchases to short sales.  \n2     \n The short-seller anticipates the stock price will fall, so that the share can be purchased \nlater at a lower price than it initially sold for; if so, the short-seller will reap a profit. \nShort-sellers must not only replace the shares but also pay the lender of the security any dividends paid during the short sale. \n In practice, the shares loaned out for a short sale are typically provided by the short-\nseller\u2019s brokerage firm, which holds a wide variety of securities of its other investors in \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   80bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   80 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded 81\n To illustrate the mechanics of short-selling, suppose you are bearish (pessimistic) on Dot \nBomb stock, and its market price is $100 per share. You tell your broker to sell short \n1,000 shares. The broker borrows 1,000 shares either from another customer\u2019s account \nor from another broker. \n The $100,000 cash proceeds from the short sale are credited to your account. \nSuppose the broker has a 50% margin requirement on short sales. This means you must \nhave other cash or securities in your account worth at least $50,000 that can serve as \nmargin on the short sale. Let\u2019s say that you have $50,000 in Treasury bills. Your account \nwith the broker after the short sale will then be: \nAssets Liabilities and Owners\u2019 Equity\nCash $100,000 Short position in Dot Bomb \n stock (1,000 shares owed)$100,000\nT-bills   50,000 Equity   50,000 Example 3.3 Short Sales \nPurchase of Stock\nTime Action Cash Flow*\n 0 Buy share 2\u00a0Initial price\n 1 Receive dividend, sell share Ending price\u00a0 1\u00a0Dividend\nProfit\u00a0 5\u00a0(Ending price\u00a0 1\u00a0Dividend)\u00a0 2\u00a0Initial price\nShort Sale of Stock\nTime Action Cash Flow*\n 0 Borrow share; sell it 1\u00a0Initial price\n 1 Repay dividend and buy share to \nreplace the share originally borrowed2\u00a0(Ending price\u00a0 1\u00a0Dividend)\nProfit\u00a0 5\u00a0Initial price\u00a0 2\u00a0(Ending price\u00a0 1\u00a0Dividend)\n*A negative cash flow implies a cash outflow.Table 3.2\nCash flows from \npurchasing versus \nshort-selling shares \nof stock\nstreet name (i.e., the broker holds the shares registered in its own name on behalf of the \nclient). The owner of the shares need not know that the shares have been lent to the short-\nseller. If the owner wishes to sell the shares, the brokerage firm will simply borrow shares \nfrom another investor. Therefore, the short sale may have an indefinite term. However, if \nthe brokerage firm cannot locate new shares to replace the ones sold, the short-seller will \nneed to repay the loan immediately by purchasing shares in the market and turning them \nover to the brokerage house to close out the loan. \n Finally, exchange rules require that proceeds from a short sale must be kept on account \nwith the broker. The short-seller cannot invest these funds to generate income, although \nlarge or institutional investors typically will receive some income from the proceeds of a \nshort sale being held with the broker. Short-sellers also are required to post margin (cash or \ncollateral) with the broker to cover losses should the stock price rise during the short sale. \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   81bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   81 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n8 2  PART I  Introduction\n    a. Construct the balance sheet if Dot Bomb in Example 3.4 goes up to $110.  \n   b. If the short position maintenance margin in the Dot Bomb example is 40%, how far can the stock price \nrise before the investor gets a margin call?    CONCEPT CHECK 3.6   Like investors who purchase stock on margin, a short-seller must be concerned about \nmargin calls. If the stock price rises, the margin in the account will fall; if margin falls to \nthe maintenance level, the short-seller will receive a margin call.  Your initial percentage margin is the ratio of the equity in the account, $50,000, to the \ncurrent value of the shares you have borrowed and eventually must return, $100,000:\n   Percentage margin 5Equity\nValue of stock owed5$50,000\n$100,0005.50  \n Suppose you are right and Dot Bomb falls to $70 per share. You can now close \nout your position at a profit. To cover the short sale, you buy 1,000 shares to replace \nthe ones you borrowed. Because the shares now sell for $70, the purchase costs only $70,000.  \n3   Because your account was credited for $100,000 when the shares were bor-\nrowed and sold, your profit is $30,000: The profit equals the decline in the share price \ntimes the number of shares sold short.  \n  3 Notice that when buying on margin, you borrow a given amount of dollars from your broker, so the amount of \nthe loan is independent of the share price. In contrast, when short-selling you borrow a given number of  shares,  \nwhich must be returned. Therefore, when the price of the shares changes, the value of the loan also changes.  Suppose the broker has a maintenance margin of 30% on short sales. This means the \nequity in your account must be at least 30% of the value of your short position at all times. How much can the price of Dot Bomb stock rise before you get a margin call? \n Let  P  be the price of Dot Bomb stock. Then the value of the shares you must pay back \nis 1,000 P  and the equity in your account is $150,000\u00a0 2 \u00a01,000 P.  Your short position margin \nratio is equity/value of stock\u00a0 5 \u00a0(150,000\u00a0 2 \u00a01,000 P )/1,000 P.  The critical value of  P  is thus\n   Equity\nValue of shares owed515,000 21,000P\n1,000P5.3 \nwhich implies that  P   5  $115.38 per share. If Dot Bomb stock should  rise  above $115.38 \nper share, you will get a margin call, and you will either have to put up additional cash or \ncover your short position by buying shares to replace the ones borrowed.  Example 3.4 Margin Calls on Short Positions \n   You can see now why stop-buy orders often accompany short sales. Imagine that you \nshort-sell Dot Bomb when it is selling at $100 per share. If the share price falls, you will \nprofit from the short sale. On the other hand, if the share price rises, let\u2019s say to $130, you will lose $30 per share. But suppose that when you initiate the short sale, you also enter a \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   82bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   82 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded  83\nstop-buy order at $120. The stop-buy will be executed if the share price surpasses $120, \nthereby limiting your losses to $20 per share. (If the stock price drops, the stop-buy will never be executed.) The stop-buy order thus provides protection to the short-seller if the share price moves up. \n Short-selling periodically comes under attack, particularly during times of financial \nstress when share prices fall. The last few years have been no exception to this rule. For example, following the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC voted to restrict short sales in stocks that decline by at least 10% on a given day. Those stocks may now be shorted on that day and the next only at a price greater than the highest bid price across national stock markets. The nearby box examines the controversy surrounding short sales in greater detail.   \n   3.10 Regulation of Securities Markets \n  Trading in securities markets in the United States is regulated by a myriad of laws. The major governing legislation includes the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The 1933 act requires full disclosure of relevant information relating to the issue of new securities. This is the act that requires registration of new securities and issuance of a prospec-tus that details the financial prospects of the firm. SEC approval of a prospectus or financial report is not an endorsement of the security as a good investment. The SEC cares only that the relevant facts are disclosed; investors must make their own evaluation of the security\u2019s value. \n The 1934 act established the Securities and Exchange Commission to administer the \nprovisions of the 1933 act. It also extended the disclosure principle of the 1933 act by requiring periodic disclosure of relevant financial information by firms with already-issued securities on secondary exchanges. \n The 1934 act also empowers the SEC to register and regulate securities exchanges, \nOTC trading, brokers, and dealers. While the SEC is the administrative agency responsible for broad oversight of the securities markets, it shares responsibility with other regula-tory agencies. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates trading in futures markets, while the Federal Reserve has broad responsibility for the health of the U.S. financial system. In this role, the Fed sets margin requirements on stocks and stock options and regulates bank lending to security market participants. \n The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 established the Securities Investor \nProtection Corporation (SIPC) to protect investors from losses if their brokerage firms fail. Just as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides depositors with federal protection against bank failure, the SIPC ensures that investors will receive securities held for their account in street name by a failed brokerage firm up to a limit of $500,000 per customer. The SIPC is financed by levying an \u201cinsurance premium\u201d on its participating, or member, brokerage firms. \n In addition to federal regulations, security trading is subject to state laws, known gener-\nally as  blue sky laws  because they are intended to give investors a clearer view of invest-\nment prospects. Varying state laws were somewhat unified when many states adopted portions of the Uniform Securities Act, which was enacted in 1956. \n The 2008 financial crisis also led to regulatory changes, some of which we detailed \nin Chapter 1. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to monitor the stability of the U.S. financial system. It is largely concerned with risks arising from potential failures of large, interconnected banks, but its voting members are the chairpersons of the main U.S. regulatory agencies, and therefore the FSOC serves a broader role to connect and coordinate key financial regulators.  \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   83bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   83 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\n84   Self-Regulation \n In addition to government regulation, the securities market exercises considerable self-\nregulation. The most important overseer in this regard is the Financial Industry Regula-tory Authority (FINRA), which is the largest nongovernmental regulator of all securities firms in the United States. FINRA was formed in 2007 through the consolidation of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) with the self-regulatory arm of the New York Stock Exchange. It describes its broad mission as the fostering of investor protection and market integrity. It examines securities firms, writes and enforces rules concerning trading practices, and administers a dispute-resolution forum for investors and registered firms. \n In addition to being governed by exchange regulation, there is also self-regulation \namong the community of investment professionals. For example, the CFA Institute has developed standards of professional conduct that govern the behavior of members with the Chartered Financial Analysts designation, commonly referred to as CFAs. The nearby box presents a brief outline of those principles.  \n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act \n The scandals of 2000\u20132002 centered largely on three broad practices: allocations of shares in initial public offerings, tainted securities research and recommendations put out to the  Short-selling has long been viewed with suspicion, if not \noutright hostility. England banned short sales for a good part of the 18th century. Napoleon called short-sellers enemies of the state. In the U.S., short-selling was widely viewed as contributing to the market crash of 1929, and in 2008, short-sellers were blamed for the collapse of the investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. With share prices of other financial firms tumbling in September 2008, the SEC instituted a temporary ban on short-selling of nearly 1,000 of those firms. Similarly, the Financial Ser-vices Authority, the financial regulator in the U.K., pro-hibited short sales on about 30 financial companies, and Australia banned shorting altogether. \n The rationale for these bans is that short sales put \ndownward pressure on share prices that in some cases may \nbe unwarranted: Rumors abound of investors who first put on a short sale and then spread negative rumors about the firm to drive down its price. More often, however, short-ing is a legitimate bet that a share price is too high and is due to fall. Nevertheless, during the market stresses of late 2008, the widespread feeling was that even if short positions were legitimate, regulators should do what they could to prop up the affected institutions. \n Hostility to short-selling may well stem from confusion \nbetween bad news and the bearer of that news. Short-\nselling allows investors whose analysis indicates a firm is overpriced to take action on that belief\u2014and to profit if they are correct. Rather than  causing  the stock price  WORDS FROM THE STREET   Short-Selling Comes Under Fire\u2014Again \nto fall, shorts may be  anticipating  a decline in the stock \nprice. Their sales simply force the market to reflect the deteriorating prospects of troubled firms sooner than it might have otherwise. In other words, short-selling is part of the process by which the full range of information and  opinion\u2014pessimistic as well as optimistic\u2014is brought to \nbear on stock prices. \n For example, short-sellers took large (negative) posi-\ntions in firms such as WorldCom, Enron, and Tyco even \nbefore these firms were exposed by regulators. In fact, one might argue that these emerging short positions helped regulators identify the previously undetected scandals. And in the end, Lehman and Bear Stearns were brought down by their very real losses on their mortgage-related investments\u2014not by unfounded rumors. \n Academic research supports the conjecture that short \nsales contribute to efficient \u201cprice discovery.\u201d For example, \nthe greater the demand for shorting a stock, the lower its future returns tend to be; moreover, firms that attack short-sellers with threats of legal action or bad publicity tend to have especially poor future returns.  \n1   Short-sale \nbans may in the end be nothing more than an understand-\nable, but nevertheless misguided, impulse to \u201cshoot the messenger.\u201d  \n1See, for example, C. Jones and O. A. Lamont, \u201cShort Sale  Constraints \nand Stock Returns,\u201d Journal of Financial Economics, November 2002, \npp. 207\u201339, or O. A.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed by Congress in 2002 in response to these problems. Among the key reforms are:\n    \u2022  Creation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to oversee the auditing of public companies.  \n   \u2022  Rules requiring independent financial experts to serve on audit committees of a firm\u2019s board of directors.  \n   \u2022  CEOs and CFOs must now personally certify that their firms\u2019 financial reports \u201cfairly represent, in all material respects, the operations and financial condition of the company,\u201d and are subject to personal penalties if those reports turn out to be misleading.

Jaffee, \u201cSpecial Information and Insider Trading,\u201d  Journal of Business  47 (July 1974).    \u2022  Auditors may no longer provide several other services to their clients. This is \nintended to prevent potential profits on consulting work from influencing the quality of their audit.  \n   \u2022  The Board of Directors must be composed of independent directors and hold regular meetings of directors in which company management is not present (and therefore cannot impede or influence the discussion).    \n More recently, there has been a fair amount of pushback on Sarbanes-Oxley. Many \nobservers believe that the compliance costs associated with the law are too onerous,  especially for smaller firms, and that heavy-handed regulatory oversight is giving for-eign locales an undue advantage over the United States when firms decide where to list their securities. Moreover, the efficacy of single-country regulation is being tested in the face of increasing globalization and the ease with which funds can move across national borders.   \n  Insider Trading \n Regulations also prohibit insider trading. It is illegal for anyone to transact in securities to profit from  inside information,  that is, private information held by officers, directors, \nor major stockholders that has not yet been divulged to the public. But the definition of insiders can be ambiguous. While it is obvious that the chief financial officer of a firm is an insider, it is less clear whether the firm\u2019s biggest supplier can be considered an insider. Yet a supplier may deduce the firm\u2019s near-term prospects from significant changes in orders. This gives the supplier a unique form of private information, yet the supplier is not technically an insider. These ambiguities plague security analysts, whose job is to uncover as much information as possible concerning the firm\u2019s expected prospects. The dividing line between legal private information and illegal inside information can be fuzzy. \n The SEC requires officers, directors, and major stockholders to report all transactions \nin their firm\u2019s stock. A compendium of insider trades is published monthly in the SEC\u2019s  Official Summary of Securities Transactions and Holdings.  The idea is to inform the public \nof any implicit vote of confidence or no confidence made by insiders. \n Insiders  do  exploit their knowledge. Three forms of evidence support this conclusion. \nFirst, there have been well-publicized convictions of principals in insider trading schemes. \n Second, there is considerable evidence of \u201cleakage\u201d of useful information to some trad-\ners before any public announcement of that information. For example, share prices of firms announcing dividend increases (which the market interprets as good news concerning the firm\u2019s prospects) commonly increase in value a few days  before  the public announcement \nof the increase. Clearly, some investors are acting on the good news before it is released to the public. Share prices still rise substantially on the day of the public release of good news, however, indicating that insiders, or their associates, have not fully bid up the price of the stock to the level commensurate with the news. \n A third form of evidence on insider trading has to do with returns earned on trades by \ninsiders. Researchers have examined the SEC\u2019s summary of insider trading to measure the performance of insiders. In one of the best known of these studies, Jaffee  \n4   examined \nthe abnormal return of stocks over the months following purchases or sales by insid-ers. For months in which insider purchasers of a stock exceeded insider sellers of the stock by three or more, the stock had an abnormal return in the following 8 months of about 5%. Moreover, when insider sellers exceeded insider buyers, the stock tended to perform poorly.      \nbod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   86bod61671_ch03_059-091.indd   86 6/18/13   7:44 PM6/18/13   7:44 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 3 How Securities Are Traded  87\n     1 .   Firms issue securities to raise the capital necessary to finance their investments. Investment \n bankers market these securities to the public on the primary market. Investment bankers generally act as underwriters who purchase the securities from the firm and resell them to the public at a markup. Before the securities may be sold to the public, the firm must publish an SEC-accepted prospectus that provides information on the firm\u2019s prospects.  \n    2 .   Already-issued securities are traded on the secondary market, that is, on organized stock markets; on the over-the-counter market; and occasionally for very large trades, through direct negotiation. Only license holders of exchanges may trade on the exchange. Brokerage firms holding licenses to trade on the exchange sell their services to individuals, charging commissions for executing trades on their behalf.  \n    3 .   Trading may take place in dealer markets, via electronic communication networks, or in specialist markets. In dealer markets, security dealers post bid and ask prices at which they are willing to trade. Brokers for individuals execute trades at the best available prices. In electronic markets, the existing book of limit orders provides the terms at which trades can be executed. Mutually agree-able offers to buy or sell securities are automatically crossed by the computer system operating the market. In specialist markets, the specialist acts to maintain an orderly market with price continuity. Specialists maintain a limit-order book, but also sell from or buy for their own inventories of stock.  \n    4 .   NASDAQ was traditionally a dealer market in which a network of dealers negotiated directly over sales of securities. The NYSE was traditionally a specialist market. In recent years, however, both exchanges have dramatically increased their commitment to electronic and automated trading. Trading activity today is overwhelmingly electronic.  \n    5 .   Buying on margin means borrowing money from a broker to buy more securities than can be purchased with one\u2019s own money alone. By buying securities on a margin, an investor magnifies both the upside potential and the downside risk. If the equity in a margin account falls below the required maintenance level, the investor will get a margin call from the broker.  \n    6 .   Short-selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own. The short-seller bor-rows the securities sold through a broker and may be required to cover the short position at any time on demand. The cash proceeds of a short sale are kept in escrow by the broker, and the broker usu-ally requires that the short-seller deposit additional cash or securities to serve as margin (collateral).  \n    7 .   Securities trading is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, by other government agencies, and through self-regulation of the exchanges. Many of the important regulations have to do with full disclosure of relevant information concerning the securities in question. Insider trading rules also prohibit traders from attempting to profit from inside information.

Also, a wide range of services claim to objectively recommend bro-\nkerage firms. However, many are actually sponsored by the brokerage firms themselves. \n  Go to the Web site   www.consumersearch.com/online-brokers/reviews   and read \nthe information provided under \u201cOur Sources.\u201d Then follow the link for the Barron\u2019s rat-\nings. Here you can read the Barron\u2019s annual broker survey and download the \u201cHow the \nBrokers Stack Up\u201d report, which contains a list of fees. Suppose that you have $3,000 to \ninvest and want to put it in a non-IRA account. \n    1. Are all of the brokerage firms suitable if you want to open a cash account? Are they all \nsuitable if you want a margin account?  \n   2. Choose two of the firms listed. Assume that you want to buy 200 shares of LLY stock \nusing a market order. If the order is filled at $42 per share, how much will the commis-\nsion be for the two firms if you place an online order?  \n   3. Are there any maintenance fees associated with the account at either brokerage firm?  \n   4. Now assume that you have a margin account and the balance is $3,000. Calculate the \ninterest rate you would pay if you borrowed money to buy stock.   \n    1. Limited-time shelf registration was introduced because its cost savings outweighed the \ndisadvantage of slightly less up-to-date disclosures.

Commonly, however, individual inves-tors do not trade securities directly for their own accounts. Instead, they direct their funds to investment companies that purchase secu-rities on their behalf. The most important of these financial intermediaries are open-end investment companies, more commonly known as mutual funds, to which we devote most of this chapter. We also touch briefly on other types of investment companies such as unit investment trusts, hedge funds, and closed-end funds. We begin the chap-ter by describing and comparing the various types of investment companies available to investors. We then examine the functions of mutual funds, their investment styles and pol-icies, and the costs of investing in these funds. Next we take a first look at the investment performance of these funds. We consider the impact of expenses and turnover on net per-formance and examine the extent to which performance is consistent from one period to the next. In other words, will the mutual funds that were the best  past  performers be \nthe best  future  performers? Finally, we dis-\ncuss sources of information on mutual funds, and we consider in detail the information provided in the most comprehensive guide, Morningstar\u2019s  Mutual Fund Sourcebook.    CHAPTER FOUR \n Mutual Funds and Other \nInvestment Companies \n     Investment companies    are financial intermediaries that collect funds from individual \ninvestors and invest those funds in a potentially wide range of securities or other assets. Pooling of assets is the key idea behind investment companies. Each investor has a claim to the portfolio established by the investment company in proportion to the amount invested. These companies thus provide a mechanism for small investors to \u201cteam up\u201d to obtain the benefits of large-scale investing. \n Investment companies perform several important functions for their investors: \n   1.  Record keeping and administration.  Investment companies issue periodic status \nreports, keeping track of capital gains distributions, dividends, investments, and \nredemptions, and they may reinvest dividend and interest income for shareholders.      4.1 Investment Companies \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   92bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   92 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 4 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies 93\n   2.  Diversification and divisibility.  By pooling their money, investment companies \nenable investors to hold fractional shares of many different securities. They can act \nas large investors even if any individual shareholder cannot.  \n   3.  Professional management.  Investment companies can support full-time staffs of \nsecurity analysts and portfolio managers who attempt to achieve superior invest-ment results for their investors.  \n   4.  Lower transaction costs.  Because they trade large blocks of securities, investment \ncompanies can achieve substantial savings on brokerage fees and commissions.    \n While all investment companies pool assets of individual investors, they also need to \ndivide claims to those assets among those investors. Investors buy shares in investment companies, and ownership is proportional to the number of shares purchased. The value of each share is called the    net asset value,    or    N AV.     Net asset value equals assets minus \nliabilities expressed on a per-share basis:\n   Net asset value 5Market value of assets minus liabilities\nShares outstandin g  \n Consider a mutual fund that manages a portfolio of securities worth $120 million. Suppose \nthe fund owes $4 million to its investment advisers and owes another $1 million for rent, wages due, and miscellaneous expenses. The fund has 5 million shares outstanding.\n   Net asset value 5$120 million2$5 million\n5 million shares5$23 per share    Example 4.1 Net Asset Value \n Consider these data from the March 2012 balance sheet of Vanguard\u2019s Growth and Income Fund. What \nwas the net asset value of the fund?  \nAssets: $2,877.06 million\nLiabilities: $   14.73 millionShares: 95.50 million CONCEPT CHECK 4.1 \n  In the United States, investment companies are classified by the Investment Company Act \nof 1940 as either unit investment trusts or managed investment companies. The portfolios of unit investment trusts are essentially fixed and thus are called \u201cunmanaged.\u201d In contrast, man-aged companies are so named because securities in their investment portfolios continually are bought and sold: The portfolios are managed. Managed companies are further classified as either closed-end or open-end. Open-end companies are what we commonly call mutual funds.  \n   Unit Investment Trusts \n    Unit investment trusts    are pools of money invested in a portfolio that is fixed for the life of the fund. To form a unit investment trust, a sponsor, typically a brokerage firm, buys a        4.2 Types of Investment Companies \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   93bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   93 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n9 4 PART I  Introduction\nportfolio of securities that are deposited into a trust. It then sells shares, or \u201cunits,\u201d in the \ntrust, called  redeemable trust certificates.   All income and payments of principal from the \nportfolio are paid out by the fund\u2019s trustees (a bank or trust company) to the shareholders. \n There is little active management of a unit investment trust because once established, \nthe portfolio composition is fixed; hence these trusts are referred to as  unmanaged.\nTrusts tend to invest in relatively uniform types of assets; for example, one trust may \ninvest in municipal bonds, another in corporate bonds. The uniformity of the portfolio is \nconsistent with the lack of active management. The trusts provide investors a vehicle to \npurchase a pool of one particular type of asset that can be included in an overall portfolio \nas desired. \n Sponsors of unit investment trusts earn their profit by selling shares in the trust at a pre-\nmium to the cost of acquiring the underlying assets. For example, a trust that has purchased \n$5 million of assets may sell 5,000 shares to the public at a price of $1,030 per share, \nwhich (assuming the trust has no liabilities) represents a 3% premium over the net asset \nvalue of the securities held by the trust. The 3% premium is the trustee\u2019s fee for establish-\ning the trust. \n Investors who wish to liquidate their holdings of a unit investment trust may sell the \nshares back to the trustee for net asset value. The trustees can either sell enough securi-\nties from the asset portfolio to obtain the cash necessary to pay the investor, or they may \ninstead sell the shares to a new investor (again at a slight premium to net asset value). Unit \ninvestment trusts have steadily lost market share to mutual funds in recent years. Assets in \nsuch trusts declined from $105 billion in 1990 to only $60 billion in 2012.  \n  Managed Investment Companies \n There are two types of managed companies: closed-end and open-end. In both cases, the \nfund\u2019s board of directors, which is elected by shareholders, hires a management company \nto manage the portfolio for an annual fee that typically ranges from .2% to 1.5% of assets. \nIn many cases the management company is the firm that organized the fund. For example, \nFidelity Management and Research Corporation sponsors many Fidelity mutual funds and \nis responsible for managing the portfolios. It assesses a management fee on each Fidelity \nfund. In other cases, a mutual fund will hire an outside portfolio manager. For example, \nVanguard has hired Wellington Management as the investment adviser for its Wellington \nFund. Most management companies have contracts to manage several funds. \n  Open-end funds    stand ready to redeem or issue shares at their net asset value (although \nboth purchases and redemptions may involve sales charges). When investors in open-end \nfunds wish to \u201ccash out\u201d their shares, they sell them back \nto the fund at NA V . In contrast,    closed-end funds    do not \nredeem or issue shares. Investors in closed-end funds \nwho wish to cash out must sell their shares to other inves-\ntors. Shares of closed-end funds are traded on organized \nexchanges and can be purchased through brokers just like \nother common stock; their prices, therefore, can differ \nfrom NA V . In early 2013, about $265 billion of assets were \nheld in closed-end funds.  \n  Figure\u00a04.1  is a listing of closed-end funds. The first col-\numn gives the name and ticker symbol of the fund. The \nnext two columns give the fund\u2019s most recent net asset \nvalue and closing share price.

To see why this is a puzzle, consider a closed-end fund that is selling at a discount from net asset value. If the fund were to sell all the assets in the portfolio, it would realize proceeds equal to net asset value. The difference between the market price of the fund and the fund\u2019s NA V would represent the per-share increase in the wealth of the fund\u2019s investors. Moreover, fund premiums or discounts tend to dissipate over time, so funds selling at a discount receive a boost to their rate of return as the discount shrinks. Pontiff estimates that a fund selling at a 20% discount would have an expected 12-month return more than 6% greater than funds selling at net asset value.  \n1    \n Interestingly, while many closed-end funds sell at a discount from net asset value, the \nprices of these funds when originally issued are often above NA V . This is a further puzzle, as it is hard to explain why investors would purchase these newly issued funds at a pre-mium to NA V when the shares tend to fall to a discount shortly after issue. \n In contrast to closed-end funds, the price of open-end funds cannot fall below NA V , \nbecause these funds stand ready to redeem shares at NA V . The offering price will exceed NA V , however, if the fund carries a    load.    A load is, in effect, a sales charge. Load funds are \nsold by securities brokers and directly by mutual fund groups. \n Unlike closed-end funds, open-end mutual funds do not trade on organized exchanges. \nInstead, investors simply buy shares from and liquidate through the investment company at net asset value. Thus the number of outstanding shares of these funds changes daily.  \n  Other Investment Organizations \n Some intermediaries are not formally organized or regulated as investment companies, but nevertheless serve similar functions. Three of the more important are commingled funds, real estate investment trusts, and hedge funds. \n  Commingled Funds   Commingled funds are partnerships of investors that pool \nfunds. The management firm that organizes the partnership, for example, a bank or insur-\nance company, manages the funds for a fee. Typical partners in a commingled fund might be trust or retirement accounts with portfolios much larger than those of most individual investors, but still too small to warrant managing on a separate basis. \n Commingled funds are similar in form to open-end mutual funds. Instead of shares, \nthough, the fund offers  units,  which are bought and sold at net asset value. A bank or insur-\nance company may offer an array of different commingled funds, for example, a money market fund, a bond fund, and a common stock fund.  \n  Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)   A REIT is similar to a closed-end fund. \nREITs invest in real estate or loans secured by real estate. Besides issuing shares, they raise \ncapital by borrowing from banks and issuing bonds or mortgages. Most of them are highly leveraged, with a typical debt ratio of 70%. \n There are two principal kinds of REITs.  Equity trusts  invest in real estate directly, \nwhereas  mortgage trusts  invest primarily in mortgage and construction loans. REITs gen-\nerally are established by banks, insurance companies, or mortgage companies, which then serve as investment managers to earn a fee.  \n  1 Jeffrey Pontiff, \u201cCostly Arbitrage: Evidence from Closed-End Funds,\u201d  Quarterly Journal of Economics  111 \n(November 1996), pp. 1135\u201351. \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   95bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   95 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n9 6  PART I  Introduction\n  Hedge Funds   Like mutual funds,    hedge funds    are vehicles that allow private inves-\ntors to pool assets to be invested by a fund manager. Unlike mutual funds, however, hedge \nfunds are commonly structured as private partnerships and thus subject to only minimal SEC regulation. They typically are open only to wealthy or institutional investors. Many require investors to agree to initial \u201clock-ups,\u201d that is, periods as long as several years in which investments cannot be withdrawn. Lock-ups allow hedge funds to invest in illiq-uid assets without worrying about meeting demands for redemption of funds. Moreover, because hedge funds are only lightly regulated, their managers can pursue investment strat-egies involving, for example, heavy use of derivatives, short sales, and leverage; such strat-egies typically are not open to mutual fund managers. \n Hedge funds by design are empowered to invest in a wide range of investments, with \nvarious funds focusing on derivatives, distressed firms, currency speculation, convertible bonds, emerging markets, merger arbitrage, and so on. Other funds may jump from one asset class to another as perceived investment opportunities shift. \n Hedge funds enjoyed great growth in the last several years, with assets under manage-\nment ballooning from about $50 billion in 1990 to just about $2 trillion in 2012. We devote all of Chapter 26 to these funds.     \n Mutual funds are the common name for open-end investment companies. This is the \ndominant investment company today, accounting for more than 90% of investment com-pany assets. Assets under management in the U.S. mutual fund industry were approxi-mately $13.5 trillion in early 2013, and approximately another $13 trillion was held in non-U.S. funds.  \n   Investment Policies \n Each mutual fund has a specified investment policy, which is described in the fund\u2019s pro-spectus. For example, money market mutual funds hold the short-term, low-risk instru-ments of the money market (see Chapter 2 for a review of these securities), while bond funds hold fixed-income securities. Some funds have even more narrowly defined man-dates. For example, some bond funds will hold primarily Treasury bonds, others primarily mortgage-backed securities. \n Management companies manage a family, or \u201ccomplex,\u201d of mutual funds. They orga-\nnize an entire collection of funds and then collect a management fee for operating them. By managing a collection of funds under one umbrella, these companies make it easy for investors to allocate assets across market sectors and to switch assets across funds while still benefiting from centralized record keeping. Some of the most well-known man-agement companies are Fidelity, Vanguard, Barclays, and T. Rowe Price. Each offers an array of open-end mutual funds with different investment policies. In 2013, there were nearly 8,000 mutual funds in the U.S., which were offered by a bit more than 700 fund complexes. \n Funds are commonly classified by investment policy into one of the following groups. \n  Money Market Funds   These funds invest in money market securities such as com-\nmercial paper, repurchase agreements, or certificates of deposit. The average maturity of    4.3 Mutual Funds  \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   96bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   96 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 4 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies 97\nthese assets tends to be a bit more than 1 month. Money market funds usually offer  check-\nwriting features, and net asset value is fixed at $1 per share,  2   so that there are no tax impli-\ncations such as capital gains or losses associated with redemption of shares.     \n  Equity Funds   Equity funds invest primarily in stock, although they may, at the portfo-\nlio manager\u2019s discretion, also hold fixed-income or other types of securities. Equity funds \ncommonly will hold between 4% and 5% of total assets in money market securities to provide the liquidity necessary to meet potential redemption of shares. \n Stock funds are traditionally classified by their emphasis on capital appreciation versus \ncurrent income. Thus,  income funds   tend to hold shares of firms with consistently high \ndividend yields.  Growth funds   are willing to forgo current income, focusing instead on pros-\npects for capital gains. While the classification of these funds is couched in terms of income versus capital gains, in practice, the more relevant distinction concerns the level of risk these funds assume. Growth stocks, and therefore growth funds, are typically riskier and respond more dramatically to changes in economic conditions than do income funds.  \n  Sector Funds   Some equity funds, called  sector  funds, concentrate on a particular \nindustry. For example, Fidelity markets dozens of \u201cselect funds,\u201d each of which invests in \na specific industry such as biotechnology, utilities, energy, or telecommunications. Other funds specialize in securities of particular countries.  \n  Bond Funds   As the name suggests, these funds specialize in the fixed-income sec-\ntor. Within that sector, however, there is considerable room for further specialization. For \nexample, various funds will concentrate on corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, or municipal (tax-free) bonds. Indeed, some municipal bond funds invest only in bonds of a particular state (or even city!) to satisfy the investment desires of resi-dents of that state who wish to avoid local as well as federal taxes on interest income. Many funds also specialize by maturity, ranging from short-term to intermediate to long-term, or by the credit risk of the issuer, ranging from very safe to high-yield, or \u201cjunk,\u201d bonds.  \n  International Funds   Many funds have international focus.  Global funds  invest in \nsecurities worldwide, including the United States. In contrast,  international funds  invest \nin securities of firms located outside the United States.  Regional funds  concentrate on a partic-\nular part of the world, and  emerging market funds  invest in companies of developing nations.  \n  Balanced Funds   Some funds are designed to be candidates for an individual\u2019s entire \ninvestment portfolio. These balanced funds hold both equities and fixed-income securi-\nties in relatively stable proportions.  Life-cycle funds  are balanced funds in which the asset \nmix can range from aggressive (primarily marketed to younger investors) to conservative (directed at older investors). Static allocation life-cycle funds maintain a stable mix across stocks and bonds, while  targeted-maturity funds  gradually become more conservative as \nthe investor ages. \n Many balanced funds are in fact    funds of funds.    These are mutual funds that primarily \ninvest in shares of other mutual funds. Balanced funds of funds invest in equity and bond funds in proportions suited to their investment goals.  \n 2 The box in Chapter 2 noted that money market funds are able to maintain NA V at $1.00 because they invest in \nshort-maturity debt of the highest quality with minimal price risk. In only the rarest circumstances have any funds \nincurred losses large enough to drive NA V below $1.00. In September 2008, however, Reserve Primary Fund, the nation\u2019s oldest money market fund, \u201cbroke the buck\u201d when it suffered losses on its holding of Lehman Brothers commercial paper, and its NA V fell to $.97.\nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   97bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   97 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n9 8 PART I  Introduction\n  Asset Allocation and Flexible Funds   These funds are similar to balanced funds \nin that they hold both stocks and bonds. However, asset allocation funds may dramatically \nvary the proportions allocated to each market in accord with the portfolio manager\u2019s fore-\ncast of the relative performance of each sector. Hence these funds are engaged in market \ntiming and are not designed to be low-risk investment vehicles.  \n  Index Funds   An index fund tries to match the performance of a broad market index. \nThe fund buys shares in securities included in a particular index in proportion to each \nsecurity\u2019s representation in that index. For example, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund is a \nmutual fund that replicates the composition of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock price \nindex. Because the S&P 500 is a value-weighted index, the fund buys shares in each \nS&P 500 company in proportion to the market value of that company\u2019s outstanding \nequity. Investment in an index fund is a low-cost way for small investors to pursue a pas-\nsive investment strategy\u2014that is, to invest without engaging in security analysis. About \n15% of equity funds in 2012 were indexed. Of course, index funds can be tied to noneq-\nuity indexes as well. For example, Vanguard offers a bond index fund and a real estate \nindex fund. \n  Table\u00a0 4.1  breaks down the number of mutual funds by investment orientation. \nSometimes a fund name describes its investment policy. For example, Vanguard\u2019s GNMA \nfund invests in mortgage-backed securities, the Municipal Intermediate fund invests in \nintermediate-term municipal bonds, and the High-Yield Corporate bond fund invests \n Table 4.1 \n U.S. mutual funds \nby investment \nclassification \n  Note: Column sums subject to rounding error.  \n Source: Investment Company Institute, 2012  Mutual Fund Fact Book.

However, names \nof common stock funds often reflect little or nothing about their investment policies. Examples are Vanguard\u2019s Windsor and Wellington funds.   \n  How Funds Are Sold \n Mutual funds are generally marketed to the public either directly by the fund underwriter or indirectly through brokers acting on behalf of the underwriter. Direct-marketed funds are sold through the mail, various offices of the fund, over the phone, or, more so, over the Internet. Investors contact the fund directly to purchase shares. \n About half of fund sales today are distributed through a sales force. Brokers or financial \nadvisers receive a commission for selling shares to investors. (Ultimately, the commission is paid by the investor. More on this shortly.) \n Investors who rely on their broker\u2019s advice to select their mutual funds should be aware \nthat brokers may have a conflict of interest with regard to fund selection. This can arise from a practice called  revenue sharing,  in which fund companies pay the brokerage firm \nfor preferential treatment when making investment recommendations. \n Many funds also are sold through \u201cfinancial supermarkets\u201d that sell shares in funds \nof many complexes. Instead of charging customers a sales commission, the broker splits management fees with the mutual fund company. Another advantage is unified record keeping for all funds purchased from the supermarket, even if the funds are offered by different complexes. On the other hand, many contend that these supermarkets result in higher expense ratios because mutual funds pass along the costs of participating in these programs in the form of higher management fees.    \n   Fee Structure \n An individual investor choosing a mutual fund should consider not only the fund\u2019s stated investment policy and past performance but also its management fees and other expenses. Comparative data on virtually all important aspects of mutual funds are available in Morningstar\u2019s  Mutual Fund Sourcebook,  which can be found in many academic and \npublic libraries. You should be aware of four general classes of fees. \n  Operating Expenses   Operating expenses are the costs incurred by the mutual fund \nin operating the portfolio, including administrative expenses and advisory fees paid to the \ninvestment manager. These expenses, usually expressed as a percentage of total assets under management, may range from 0.2% to 2%. Shareholders do not receive an explicit bill for these operating expenses; however, the expenses periodically are deducted from the assets of the fund. Shareholders pay for these expenses through the reduced value of the portfolio. \n The simple average of the expense ratio of equity funds in the U.S. was 1.43% in 2011. \nBut larger funds tend to have lower expense ratios, so the average expense ratio weighted by assets under management is considerably smaller, 0.79%. Not surprisingly, the average expense ratio of actively managed funds is considerably higher than that of indexed funds, .93% versus .14% (weighted by assets under management). \n In addition to operating expenses, many funds assess fees to pay for marketing and \ndistribution costs. These charges are used primarily to pay the brokers or financial advis-ers who sell the funds to the public. Investors can avoid these expenses by buying shares directly from the fund sponsor, but many investors are willing to incur these distribution fees in return for the advice they may receive from their broker.     4.4 Costs of Investing in Mutual Funds \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   99bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   99 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n100 PART I  Introduction\n  Front-End Load   A front-end load is a commission or sales charge paid when you \npurchase the shares. These charges, which are used primarily to pay the brokers who sell \nthe funds, may not exceed 8.5%, but in practice they are rarely higher than 6%.  Low-load \nfunds  have loads that range up to 3% of invested funds.  No-load funds  have no front-end \nsales charges. Loads effectively reduce the amount of money invested. For example, each $1,000 paid for a fund with a 6% load results in a sales charge of $60 and fund investment of only $940. You need cumulative returns of 6.4% of your net investment (60/940\u00a0 5 \u00a0.064) \njust to break even.  \n  Back-End Load   A back-end load is a redemption, or \u201cexit,\u201d fee incurred when you \nsell your shares. Typically, funds that impose back-end loads start them at 5% or 6% and \nreduce them by 1 percentage point for every year the funds are left invested. Thus an exit fee that starts at 6% would fall to 4% by the start of your third year. These charges are known more formally as \u201ccontingent deferred sales charges.\u201d  \n  12b-1 Charges   The Securities and Exchange Commission allows the managers of \nso-called 12b-1 funds to use fund assets to pay for distribution costs such as advertis-\ning, promotional literature including annual reports and prospectuses, and, most important, commissions paid to brokers who sell the fund to investors. These    12b-1 fees    are named \nafter the SEC rule that permits use of these plans. Funds may use 12b-1 charges instead of, or in addition to, front-end loads to generate the fees with which to pay brokers. As with operating expenses, investors are not explicitly billed for 12b-1 charges. Instead, the fees are deducted from the assets of the fund. Therefore, 12b-1 fees (if any) must be added to operating expenses to obtain the true annual expense ratio of the fund. The SEC requires that all funds include in the prospectus a consolidated expense table that summarizes all relevant fees. The 12b-1 fees are limited to 1% of a fund\u2019s average net assets per year.  \n3    \n Many funds offer \u201cclasses\u201d that represent ownership in the same portfolio of securities, \nbut with different combinations of fees. For example, Class A shares might have front-end loads while Class B shares rely on 12b-1 fees. \n  3 The maximum 12b-1 charge for the sale of the fund is .75%. However, an additional service fee of .25% of the \nfund\u2019s assets also is allowed for personal service and/or maintenance of shareholder accounts.  Here are fees for different classes of the Dreyfus High Yield Fund in 2012. Notice the \ntrade-off between the front-end loads versus 12b-1 charges in the choice between Class A and Class C shares. Class I shares are sold only to institutional investors and carry lower fees.

Obviously, pure no-load no-fee \nfunds distributed directly by the mutual fund group are the cheapest alternative, and these \nwill often make most sense for knowledgeable investors. However, as we have noted, many investors are willing to pay for financial advice, and the commissions paid to advisers who sell these funds are the most common form of payment. Alternatively, investors may choose to hire a fee-only financial manager who charges directly for services instead of collecting commissions. These advisers can help investors select portfolios of low- or no-load funds (as well as provide other financial advice). Independent financial planners have become increasingly important distribution channels for funds in recent years. \n If you do buy a fund through a broker, the choice between paying a load and paying \n12b-1 fees will depend primarily on your expected time horizon. Loads are paid only once for each purchase, whereas 12b-1 fees are paid annually. Thus, if you plan to hold your fund for a long time, a one-time load may be preferable to recurring 12b-1 charges.   \n  Fees and Mutual Fund Returns \n The rate of return on an investment in a mutual fund is measured as the increase or decrease in net asset value plus income distributions such as dividends or distributions of capital gains expressed as a fraction of net asset value at the beginning of the investment period. If we denote the net asset value at the start and end of the period as NA V \n0  and NA V 1 , \nrespectively, then\n   Rate of return 5NAV 12NAV 01Income and capital gain distributions\nNAV 0 \nFor example, if a fund has an initial NA V of $20 at the start of the month, makes income distributions of $.15 and capital gain distributions of $.05, and ends the month with NA V of $20.10, the monthly rate of return is computed as\n   Rate of return 5\n$20.102$20.001$.151$.05\n$20.005.015, or 1.5%  \nNotice that this measure of the rate of return ignores any commissions such as front-end loads paid to purchase the fund. \n On the other hand, the rate of return is affected by the fund\u2019s expenses and 12b-1 fees. \nThis is because such charges are periodically deducted from the portfolio, which reduces net asset value. Thus the investor\u2019s rate of return equals the gross return on the underlying portfolio minus the total expense ratio. \n \n To see how expenses can affect rate of return, consider a fund with $100 million in \nassets at the start of the year and with 10 million shares outstanding. The fund invests in a portfolio of stocks that provides no income but increases in value by 10%. The expense ratio, including 12b-1 fees, is 1%. What is the rate of return for an investor in the fund? \n The initial NAV equals $100 million/10 million shares\u00a0 5 \u00a0$10 per share. In the absence \nof expenses, fund assets would grow to $110 million and NAV would grow to $11 per \nshare, for a 10% rate of return. However, the expense ratio of the fund is 1%. Therefore, $1 million will be deducted from the fund to pay these fees, leaving the portfolio worth only $109 million, and NAV equal to $10.90. The rate of return on the fund is only 9%, which equals the gross return on the underlying portfolio minus the total expense ratio.

Table\u00a04.2  considers an investor who starts \nwith $10,000 and can choose among three funds that all earn an annual 12% return on invest-\nment before fees but have different fee structures. The table shows the cumulative amount \nin each fund after several investment horizons. Fund A has total operating expenses of .5%, \nno load, and no 12b-1 charges. This might represent a low-cost producer like Vanguard. \nFund B has no load but has 1% in management expenses and .5% in 12b-1 fees. This level \nof charges is fairly typical of actively managed equity funds. Finally, Fund C has 1% in man-\nagement expenses, has no 12b-1 charges, but assesses an 8% front-end load on purchases. \n Note the substantial return advantage of low-cost Fund A. Moreover, that differential is \ngreater for longer investment horizons.  \n Table 4.2 \n Impact of costs on investment \nperformance Cumulative Proceeds\n(All Dividends Reinvested)\nFund A Fund B Fund C\nInitial investment* $10,000 $10,000 $  9,200\n 5 years 17,234 16,474 15,502\n10 years 29,699 27,141 26,123\n15 years 51,183 44,713 44,018\n20 years 88,206 73,662 74,173\n   * After front-end load, if any. \n Notes: \n  1.

Gross return on all funds is 12% per year before expenses.     \n The Equity Fund sells Class A shares with a front-end load of 4% and Class B shares with 12b-1 fees of \n.5% annually as well as back-end load fees that start at 5% and fall by 1% for each full year the investor \nholds the portfolio (until the fifth year). Assume the rate of return on the fund portfolio net of operating \nexpenses is 10% annually. What will be the value of a $10,000 investment in Class A and Class B shares if \nthe shares are sold after ( a ) 1 year, ( b ) 4 years, ( c ) 10 years? Which fee structure provides higher net pro-\nceeds at the end of each investment horizon?  CONCEPT CHECK 4.2 \n Although expenses can have a big impact on net investment performance, it is \nsometimes difficult for the investor in a mutual fund to measure true expenses accurately. \nThis is because of the practice of paying for some expenses in    soft dollars.    A portfo-\nlio manager earns soft-dollar credits with a brokerage firm by directing the fund\u2019s trades \nto that broker. On the basis of those credits, the broker will pay for some of the mutual \nfund\u2019s expenses, such as databases, computer hardware, or stock-quotation systems. The \nsoft-dollar arrangement means that the stockbroker effectively returns part of the trading \ncommission to the fund. Purchases made with soft dollars are not included in the fund\u2019s \nexpenses, so funds with extensive soft-dollar arrangements may report artificially low \nexpense ratios to the public. However, the fund may have paid its broker needlessly high \ncommissions to obtain its soft-dollar \u201crebate.\u201d The impact of the higher trading commis-\nsion shows up in net investment performance rather than the reported expense ratio.    \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   102bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   102 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 4 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies 103\n Investment returns of mutual funds are granted \u201cpass-through status\u201d under the U.S. tax \ncode, meaning that taxes are paid only by the investor in the mutual fund, not by the fund itself. The income is treated as passed through to the investor as long as the fund meets sev-eral requirements, most notably that virtually all income is distributed to shareholders. A fund\u2019s short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains, and dividends are passed through to investors as though the investor earned the income directly. \n The pass-through of investment income has one important disadvantage for individual \ninvestors. If you manage your own portfolio, you decide when to realize capital gains and losses on any security; therefore, you can time those realizations to efficiently manage your tax liabilities. When you invest through a mutual fund, however, the timing of the sale of securities from the portfolio is out of your control, which reduces your ability to engage in tax management.  \n4    \n A fund with a high portfolio turnover rate can be particularly \u201ctax inefficient.\u201d    Turnover    \nis the ratio of the trading activity of a portfolio to the assets of the portfolio. It measures the fraction of the portfolio that is \u201creplaced\u201d each year. For example, a $100 million portfolio with $50 million in sales of some securities and purchases of other securities would have a turnover rate of 50%. High turnover means that capital gains or losses are being realized constantly, and therefore that the investor cannot time the realizations to manage his or her overall tax obligation. \n Turnover rates in equity funds in the last decade have typically been around 60% when \nweighted by assets under management. By contrast, a low-turnover fund such as an index fund may have turnover as low as 2%, which is both tax-efficient and economical with respect to trading costs.       4.5 Taxation of Mutual Fund Income  \n  4 An interesting problem that an investor needs to be aware of derives from the fact that capital gains and divi-\ndends on mutual funds are typically paid out to shareholders once or twice a year. This means that an investor \nwho has just purchased shares in a mutual fund can receive a capital gain distribution (and be taxed on that dis-tribution) on transactions that occurred long before he or she purchased shares in the fund. This is particularly a concern late in the year when such distributions typically are made.  An investor\u2019s portfolio currently is worth $1 million. During the year, the investor sells 1,000 shares of \nFedEx at a price of $80 per share and 4,000 shares of Cisco at a price of $20 per share. The proceeds are used to buy 800 shares of IBM at $200 per share.  \n    a.  What was the portfolio turnover rate?  \n    b.  If the shares in FedEx originally were purchased for $70 each and those in Cisco were purchased for \n$17.50, and the investor\u2019s tax rate on capital gains income is 20%, how much extra will the investor owe on this year\u2019s taxes as a result of these transactions?    CONCEPT CHECK 4.3 \n    Exchange-traded funds    (ETFs), first introduced in 1993, are offshoots of mutual funds \nthat allow investors to trade index portfolios just as they do shares of stock.

By 2012, about $1 trillion was invested in more than 1,100 U.S. ETFs. \n Table\u00a04.3 , panel A presents some of the major sponsors of ETFs, and panel B gives a small \nflavor of the types of funds offered.   \n  Figure\u00a0 4.2  shows the rapid growth in the ETF market since 1998. Until 2008, most \nETFs were required to track specified indexes, and ETFs tracking broad indexes still domi-\nnate the industry. However, there are dozens of industry-sector ETFs, and as  Figure\u00a04.2  \nmakes clear, commodity, bond, and international ETFs have grown especially dramatically \nin recent years. While only $1 billion was invested in commodity ETFs in 2004, by 2011 \nthis value had grown to $109 billion. Gold and silver ETFs dominate this sector, account-\ning for about three-quarters of commodity-based funds. Indeed, ETFs have become the \nmain way for investors to speculate in precious metals.  Figure\u00a0 4.3  shows that by 2011 \nETFs had captured a significant portion of the assets under management in the investment \ncompany universe.  \n Table 4.3 \n ETF sponsors and products A.

For more information on these \nfunds, go to   www.iShares.com.   \n More recently, a variety of new ETF products have been devised. Among these are lev-\neraged ETFs, with daily returns that are a targeted  multiple  of the returns on an index, and \ninverse ETFs, which move in the opposite direction to an index. In addition, there is now a small number of actively managed ETF funds that, like actively managed mutual funds, attempt to outperform market indexes. But these account for only about 3% of assets under management in the ETF industry. \n Other even more exotic variations are so-called synthetic ETFs such as exchange-\ntraded notes (ETNs) or exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs). These are nominally debt securities, but with payoffs linked to the performance of an index. Often that index mea-sures the performance of an illiquid and thinly traded asset class, so the ETF gives the investor the opportunity to add that asset class to his or her portfolio. However, rather than invest in those assets directly, the ETF achieves this exposure by entering a \u201ctotal return swap\u201d with an investment bank in which the bank agrees to pay the ETF the return on the index in exchange for a relatively fixed fee. These have become controversial, as the ETF is then exposed to risk that in a period of financial stress the investment bank will be unable to fulfill its obligation, leaving investors without the returns they were promised. \n ETFs offer several advantages over conventional mutual funds. First, as we just noted, \na mutual fund\u2019s net asset value is quoted\u2014and therefore, investors can buy or sell their shares in the fund\u2014only once a day. In contrast, ETFs trade continuously. Moreover, like other shares, but unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be sold short or purchased on margin. \n ETFs also offer a potential tax advantage over mutual funds. When large numbers \nof mutual fund investors redeem their shares, the fund must sell securities to meet the redemptions. This can trigger capital gains taxes, which are passed through to and must be paid by the remaining shareholders. In contrast, when small investors wish to redeem their position in an ETF, they simply sell their shares to other traders, with no need for the fund to sell any of the underlying portfolio. Large investors can exchange their ETF shares for shares in the underlying portfolio; this form of redemption also avoids a tax event. \n ETFs are often cheaper than mutual funds. Investors who buy ETFs do so through bro-\nkers rather than buying directly from the fund. Therefore, the fund saves the cost of mar-keting itself directly to small investors. This reduction in expenses may translate into lower management fees. \n There are some disadvantages to ETFs, however. First, while mutual funds can be \nbought at no expense from no-load funds, ETFs must be purchased from brokers for a fee. In addition, because ETFs trade as securities, their prices can depart from NA V , at least for short periods, and these price discrepancies can easily swamp the cost advan-tage that ETFs otherwise offer. While those discrepancies typically are quite small, they can spike unpredictably when markets are stressed. Chapter 2 briefly discussed the so-called flash crash of May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 583 points in  seven minutes,  leaving it down nearly 1,000 points for the day. Remarkably, the \nindex recovered more than 600 points in the next 10 minutes. In the wake of this incred-ible volatility, the stock exchanges canceled many trades that had gone off at what were viewed as distorted prices. Around one-fifth of all ETFs changed hands on that day at prices less than one-half of their closing price, and ETFs accounted for about two-thirds of all canceled trades. \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   106bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   106 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 4 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies 107\n We noted earlier that one of the benefits of mutual funds for the individual investor is the \nability to delegate management of the portfolio to investment professionals. The investor retains control over the broad features of the overall portfolio through the asset allocation decision: Each individual chooses the percentages of the portfolio to invest in bond funds versus equity funds versus money market funds, and so forth, but can leave the specific security selection decisions within each investment class to the managers of each fund. Shareholders hope that these portfolio managers can achieve better investment perfor-mance than they could obtain on their own. \n What is the investment record of the mutual fund industry? This seemingly straightfor-\nward question is deceptively difficult to answer because we need a standard against which to evaluate performance. For example, we clearly would not want to compare the invest-ment performance of an equity fund to the rate of return available in the money market. The vast differences in the risk of these two markets dictate that year-by-year as well as average performance will differ considerably. We would expect to find that equity funds outperform money market funds (on average) as compensation to investors for the extra risk incurred in equity markets. How then can we determine whether mutual fund portfolio managers are performing up to par  given  the level of risk they incur? In other words, what \nis the proper benchmark against which investment performance ought to be evaluated? \n Measuring portfolio risk properly and using such measures to choose an appropriate \nbenchmark is far from straightforward. We devote all of Parts Two and Three of the text to issues surrounding the proper measurement of portfolio risk and the trade-off between risk and return. In this chapter, therefore, we will satisfy ourselves with a first look at the question of fund performance by using only very simple performance benchmarks and ignoring the more subtle issues of risk differences across funds. However, we will return to this topic in Chapter 11, where we take a closer look at mutual fund performance after adjusting for differences in the exposure of portfolios to various sources of risk. \n Here we use as a benchmark for the performance of equity fund managers the rate of \nreturn on the Wilshire 5000 index. Recall from Chapter 2 that this is a value-weighted index of essentially all actively traded U.S. stocks. The performance of the Wilshire 5000 is a useful benchmark with which to evaluate professional managers because it corresponds to a simple passive investment strategy: Buy all the shares in the index in proportion to their outstanding market value. Moreover, this is a feasible strategy for even small investors, because the Vanguard Group offers an index fund (its Total Stock Market Portfolio) designed to replicate the performance of the Wilshire 5000 index. Using the Wilshire 5000 index as a benchmark, we may pose the problem of evaluat-ing the performance of mutual fund portfolio managers this way: How does the typical performance of actively managed equity mutual funds compare to the performance of a passively managed portfolio that simply replicates the composition of a broad index of the stock market?    4.7 Mutual Fund Investment Performance: A First Look   At least two problems were exposed in this episode. First, when markets are not work-\ning properly, it can be hard to measure the net asset value of the ETF portfolio, especially for ETFs that track less liquid assets. And, reinforcing this problem, some ETFs may be supported by only a very small number of dealers. If they drop out of the market during a period of turmoil, prices may swing wildly.   \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   107bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   107 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 0 8 PART I  Introduction\n Casual comparisons of the performance of the Wilshire 5000 index versus that of \nprofessionally managed mutual funds reveal disappointing results for active managers. \n Figure\u00a04.4  shows that the average return on diversified equity funds was below the return on \nthe Wilshire index in 25 of the 41 years from 1971 to 2011. The average annual return \non the index was 11.75%, which was 1% greater than that of the average mutual fund.  5    \n This result may seem surprising. After all, it would not seem unreasonable to expect \nthat professional money managers should be able to outperform a very simple rule such as \n\u201chold an indexed portfolio.\u201d As it turns out, however, there may be good reasons to expect \nsuch a result. We explore them in detail in Chapter 11, where we discuss the efficient mar-\nket hypothesis. \n Of course, one might argue that there are good managers and bad managers, and that \ngood managers can, in fact, consistently outperform the index. To test this notion, we \nexamine whether managers with good performance in one year are likely to repeat that per-\nformance in a following year. Is superior performance in any particular year due to luck, \nand therefore random, or due to skill, and therefore consistent from year to year? \n To answer this question, we can examine the performance of a large sample of equity \nmutual fund portfolios, divide the funds into two groups based on total investment return, \nand ask: \u201cDo funds with investment returns in the top half of the sample in one period con-\ntinue to perform well in a subsequent period?\u201d  \n5 Of course, actual funds incur trading costs while indexes do not, so a fair comparison between the returns on \nactively managed funds versus those on a passive index should first reduce the return on the Wilshire 5000 by an \nestimate of such costs. Vanguard\u2019s Total Stock Market Index portfolio, which tracks the Wilshire 5000, charges \nan expense ratio of less than .10%, and, because it engages in little trading, incurs low trading costs. Therefore, \nit would be reasonable to reduce the returns on the index by about .15%. This reduction would not erase the dif-\nference in average performance. \n Figure 4.4 Rates of return on actively managed equity funds versus Wilshire 5000 index, 1971\u20132011   \nSource: For Wilshire returns, see www.wilshire.com.

If performance were purely random from one period to the next, \nthere would be entries of 50% in each cell of the table, as top- or bottom-half performers \nwould be equally likely to perform in either the top or bottom half of the sample in the \nfollowing period. On the other hand, if performance were due entirely to skill, with no \nrandomness, we would expect to see entries of 100% on the diagonals and entries of 0% on \nthe off-diagonals: Top-half performers would all remain in the top half while bottom-half \nperformers similarly would all remain in the bottom half. In fact, the table shows that 65.1% of \ninitial top-half performers fall in the top half of the sample in the following period, while 64.5% \nof initial bottom-half performers fall in the bottom half in the following period. This evidence \nis consistent with the notion that at least part of a fund\u2019s performance is a function of skill as \nopposed to luck, so that relative performance tends to persist from one period to the next.  7    \n On the other hand, this relationship does not seem stable across different sample \nperiods. While initial-year performance predicts subsequent-year performance in the 1970s \n(panel A), the pattern of persistence in performance virtually disappears in the 1980s (panel B). \nTo summarize, the evidence that performance is consistent from one period to the next is \nsuggestive, but it is inconclusive. \n Other studies suggest that there is little performance persistence among professional \nmanagers, and if anything, bad performance is more likely to persist than good perfor-\nmance.  8   This makes some sense: It is easy to identify fund characteristics that will result in \nconsistently poor investment performance, notably high expense ratios, and high turnover \nratios with associated trading costs. It is far harder to identify the secrets of successful \nstock picking. (If it were easy, we would all be rich!) Thus the consistency we do observe \nin fund performance may be due in large part to the poor performers. This suggests that \nthe real value of past performance data is to avoid truly poor funds, even if identifying the \nfuture top performers is still a daunting task.      \n Table 4.4 \n Consistency of \ninvestment results Successive Period Performance\nInitial Period Performance Top Half Bottom Half\nA.

CONCEPT CHECK 4.4 \n The first place to find information on a mutual fund is in its prospectus. The Securities and \nExchange Commission requires that the prospectus describe the fund\u2019s investment objec-tives and policies in a concise \u201cStatement of Investment Objectives\u201d as well as in lengthy discussions of investment policies and risks. The fund\u2019s investment adviser and its port-folio manager are also described. The prospectus also presents the costs associated with purchasing shares in the fund in a fee table. Sales charges such as front-end and back-end loads as well as annual operating expenses such as management fees and 12b-1 fees are detailed in the fee table. \n Funds provide information about themselves in two other sources. The Statement of \nAdditional Information (SAI), also known as Part B of the prospectus, includes a list of the securities in the portfolio at the end of the fiscal year, audited financial statements, a list of the directors and officers of the fund\u2014as well as their personal investments in the fund, and data on brokerage commissions paid by the fund. However, unlike the fund prospec-tus, investors do not receive the SAI unless they specifically request it; one industry joke is that SAI stands for \u201csomething always ignored.\u201d The fund\u2019s annual report also includes portfolio composition and financial statements, as well as a discussion of the factors that influenced fund performance over the last reporting period. \n With thousands of funds to choose from, it can be difficult to find and select the \nfund that is best suited for a particular need. Several publications now offer \u201cencyclope-dias\u201d of mutual fund information to help in the search process. One prominent source is Morningstar\u2019s  Mutual Fund Sourcebook.  Morningstar\u2019s Web site,   www.morningstar.com,   \nis another excellent source of information, as is Yahoo!\u2019s site,   finance.yahoo.com/funds.   \nThe Investment Company Institute ( www.ici.org ), the national association of mutual \nfunds, closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts, publishes an annual  Directory of \nMutual Funds  that includes information on fees as well as phone numbers to contact funds. To illustrate the range of information available about funds, we consider Morningstar\u2019s report on Wells Fargo\u2019s Advantage Growth Fund, reproduced in  Figure\u00a04.5 . \n The table on the left labeled \u201cPerformance\u201d first shows the fund\u2019s quarterly returns \nin the last few years, and just below that, returns over longer periods. You can compare returns to both its standard index (the S&P 500) and its category index (the Russell 1000) in the rows labeled  1 /2 Index, as well as its percentile rank within its comparison group, \nor category. Continuing down the left column we see data on fees and expenses, as well as several measures of the fund\u2019s risk and return characteristics. (We will discuss all of these measures in Part 2 of the text.) The fund has provided good returns compared to risk, earning it the coveted Morningstar 5-star rating. Of course, we are all accustomed to the disclaimer that \u201cpast performance is not a reliable measure of future results,\u201d and this is true as well of Morningstar\u2019s star ratings. Consistent with this disclaimer, past results have little predictive power for future performance, as we saw in  Table\u00a04.4 .    4.8 Information on Mutual Funds  \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   110bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   110 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 4 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies 111\n Figure 4.5 Morningstar report   \nSource: Morningstar Mutual Funds, \u00a9 2012 Morningstar, Inc.

The line graph compares the growth of $10,000 invested in the fund versus its two \ncomparison indexes over the last 10 years. Below the graph are boxes for each year that depict the relative performance of the fund for that year. The shaded area on the box shows the quartile in which the fund\u2019s performance falls relative to other funds with the same objective. If the shaded band is at the top of the box, the firm was a top quartile performer in that period, and so on. The table below the bar charts presents historical data on the year-by-year performance of the fund. \n Below the table, the \u201cPortfolio Analysis\u201d table shows the asset allocation of the fund, and \nthen Morningstar\u2019s well-known style box. In this box, Morningstar evaluates style along two dimensions: One dimension is the size of the firms held in the portfolio as measured by the market value of outstanding equity; the other dimension is a value/growth measure. Morningstar defines  value stocks  as those with low ratios of market price per share to vari-\nous measures of value. It puts stocks on a growth-value continuum based on the ratios of stock price to the firm\u2019s earnings, book value, sales, cash flow, and dividends. Value stocks are those with a low price relative to these measures of value. In contrast,  growth stocks   \nhave high ratios, suggesting that investors in these firms must believe that the firm will experience rapid growth to justify the prices at which the stocks sell. The shaded box shows that the fund tends to hold larger firms (top row) and growth stocks (right column).  \n Finally, the tables in the right column provide information on the current composition \nof the portfolio. You can find the fund\u2019s 15 \u201cTop Holdings\u201d there as well as the weighting of the portfolio across various sectors of the economy.    \n    1 .   Unit investment trusts, closed-end management companies, and open-end management compa-\nnies are all classified and regulated as investment companies. Unit investment trusts are essen-tially unmanaged in the sense that the portfolio, once established, is fixed. Managed investment companies, in contrast, may change the composition of the portfolio as deemed fit by the portfo-lio manager. Closed-end funds are traded like other securities; they do not redeem shares for their investors. Open-end funds will redeem shares for net asset value at the request of the investor.  \n    2 .   Net asset value equals the market value of assets held by a fund minus the liabilities of the fund divided by the shares outstanding.  \n    3 .   Mutual funds free the individual from many of the administrative burdens of owning individual securities and offer professional management of the portfolio. They also offer advantages that are available only to large-scale investors, such as discounted trading costs. On the other hand, funds are assessed management fees and incur other expenses, which reduce the investor\u2019s rate of return. Funds also eliminate some of the individual\u2019s control over the timing of capital gains realizations.  \n    4 .   Mutual funds are often categorized by investment policy. Major policy groups include money market funds; equity funds, which are further grouped according to emphasis on income versus growth; fixed-income funds; balanced and income funds; asset allocation funds; index funds; and specialized sector funds.  \n    5 .   Costs of investing in mutual funds include front-end loads, which are sales charges; back-end loads, which are redemption fees or, more formally, contingent-deferred sales charges; fund oper-ating expenses; and 12b-1 charges, which are recurring fees used to pay for the expenses of mar-keting the fund to the public.  \n    6 .   Income earned on mutual fund portfolios is not taxed at the level of the fund. Instead, as long as the fund meets certain requirements for pass-through status, the income is treated as being earned by the investors in the fund.

The average rate of return of the average equity mutual fund in the last four decades has been \nbelow that of a passive index fund holding a portfolio to replicate a broad-based index like the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000. Some of the reasons for this disappointing record are the costs incurred by actively managed funds, such as the expense of conducting the research to guide stock-picking activities, and trading costs due to higher portfolio turnover. The record on the consistency of fund performance is mixed. In some sample periods, the better-performing funds continue to perform well in the following periods; in other sample periods they do not.

Would you expect a typical open-end fixed-income mutual fund to have higher or lower operat-\ning expenses than a fixed-income unit investment trust? Why?  \n   2. What are some comparative advantages of investing in the following: \n    a.  Unit investment trusts.  \n    b.  Open-end mutual funds.  \n    c.  Individual stocks and bonds that you choose for yourself.     \n   3. Open-end equity mutual funds find it necessary to keep a significant percentage of total invest-\nments, typically around 5% of the portfolio, in very liquid money market assets. Closed-end funds do not have to maintain such a position in \u201ccash equivalent\u201d securities. What difference between open-end and closed-end funds might account for their differing policies?  \n   4. Balanced funds, life-cycle funds, and asset allocation funds all invest in both the stock and bond \nmarkets. What are the differences among these types of funds?  \n   5. Why can closed-end funds sell at prices that differ from net asset value while open-end funds \ndo not?      \n   6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of exchange-traded funds versus mutual funds?  \n   7. An open-end fund has a net asset value of $10.70 per share. It is sold with a front-end load of \n6%. What is the offering price?  \n   8. If the offering price of an open-end fund is $12.30 per share and the fund is sold with a front-\nend load of 5%, what is its net asset value?  \n   9.

There are 4 million shares outstanding. What is the net asset value \nof the fund?  \n   10. Reconsider the Fingroup Fund in the previous problem. If during the year the portfolio \nmanager sells all of the holdings of stock D and replaces it with 200,000 shares of stock E at $50 per share and 200,000 shares of stock F at $25 per share, what is the portfolio turn-over rate?

The Closed Fund is a closed-end investment company with a portfolio currently worth $200 \nmillion. It has liabilities of $3 million and 5 million shares outstanding. \n    a.  What is the NA V of the fund?  \n    b.  If the fund sells for $36 per share, what is its premium or discount as a percent of net asset \nvalue?     \n   12. Corporate Fund started the year with a net asset value of $12.50. By year-end, its NA V equaled \n$12.10. The fund paid year-end distributions of income and capital gains of $1.50. What was the (pretax) rate of return to an investor in the fund?  \n   13. A closed-end fund starts the year with a net asset value of $12.00. By year-end, NA V equals \n$12.10. At the beginning of the year, the fund was selling at a 2% premium to NA V . By the end of the year, the fund is selling at a 7% discount to NA V . The fund paid year-end distributions of income and capital gains of $1.50. \n    a.  What is the rate of return to an investor in the fund during the year?  \n    b.  What would have been the rate of return to an investor who held the same securities as the \nfund manager during the year?     \n   14.      a.   Impressive Fund had excellent investment performance last year, with portfolio returns that \nplaced it in the top 10% of all funds with the same investment policy. Do you expect it to be a top performer next year? Why or why not?  \n    b.  Suppose instead that the fund was among the poorest performers in its comparison group. \nWould you be more or less likely to believe its relative performance will persist into the fol-lowing year? Why?     \n   15. Consider a mutual fund with $200 million in assets at the start of the year and with 10 million \nshares outstanding. The fund invests in a portfolio of stocks that provides dividend income at the end of the year of $2 million. The stocks included in the fund\u2019s portfolio increase in price by 8%, but no securities are sold, and there are no capital gains distributions. The fund charges 12b-1 fees of 1%, which are deducted from portfolio assets at year-end. What is net asset value at the start and end of the year? What is the rate of return for an investor in the fund?  \n   16. The New Fund had average daily assets of $2.2 billion last year. The fund sold $400 million \nworth of stock and purchased $500 million during the year. What was its turnover ratio?  \n   17. If New Fund\u2019s expense ratio (see the previous problem) was 1.1% and the management fee was \n.7%, what were the total fees paid to the fund\u2019s investment managers during the year? What were other administrative expenses?  \n   18. You purchased 1,000 shares of the New Fund at a price of $20 per share at the beginning of \nthe year. You paid a front-end load of 4%. The securities in which the fund invests increase in value by 12% during the year. The fund\u2019s expense ratio is 1.2%. What is your rate of return on the fund if you sell your shares at the end of the year?      \n   19. Loaded-Up Fund charges a 12b-1 fee of 1.0% and maintains an expense ratio of .75%. Econ-\nomy Fund charges a front-end load of 2% but has no 12b-1 fee and an expense ratio of .25%. Assume the rate of return on both funds\u2019 portfolios (before any fees) is 6% per year. How much will an investment in each fund grow to after: \n    a.  1 year.  \n    b.  3 years.  \n    c.  10 years.     \n   20. City Street Fund has a portfolio of $450 million and liabilities of $10 million. \n    a.  If 44 million shares are outstanding, what is net asset value?      b.  If a large investor redeems 1 million shares, what happens to the portfolio value, to shares \noutstanding, and to NA V?     \n   21. The Investments Fund sells Class A shares with a front-end load of 6% and Class B shares with \n12b-1 fees of .5% annually as well as back-end load fees that start at 5% and fall by 1% for each full year the investor holds the portfolio (until the fifth year). Assume the portfolio rate of return \nbod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   114bod61671_ch04_092-116.indd   114 6/18/13   8:35 PM6/18/13   8:35 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 4 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies 115\nnet of operating expenses is 10% annually. If you plan to sell the fund after 4 years, are Class A \nor Class B shares the better choice for you? What if you plan to sell after 15 years?  \n   22. You are considering an investment in a mutual fund with a 4% load and expense ratio of .5%. \nYou can invest instead in a bank CD paying 6% interest. \n    a.  If you plan to invest for 2 years, what annual rate of return must the fund portfolio earn for \nyou to be better off in the fund than in the CD? Assume annual compounding of returns.  \n    b.  How does your answer change if you plan to invest for 6 years? Why does your answer \nchange?  \n    c.  Now suppose that instead of a front-end load the fund assesses a 12b-1 fee of .75% per year. \nWhat annual rate of return must the fund portfolio earn for you to be better off in the fund \nthan in the CD? Does your answer in this case depend on your time horizon?     \n   23. Suppose that every time a fund manager trades stock, transaction costs such as commissions \nand bid\u2013ask spreads amount to .4% of the value of the trade. If the portfolio turnover rate is 50%, by how much is the total return of the portfolio reduced by trading costs?  \n   24. You expect a tax-free municipal bond portfolio to provide a rate of return of 4%. Management \nfees of the fund are .6%. What fraction of portfolio income is given up to fees? If the manage-ment fees for an equity fund also are .6%, but you expect a portfolio return of 12%, what frac-tion of portfolio income is given up to fees? Why might management fees be a bigger factor in your investment decision for bond funds than for stock funds? Can your conclusion help explain why unmanaged unit investment trusts tend to focus on the fixed-income market?  \n   25. Suppose you observe the investment performance of 350 portfolio managers for 5 years and \nrank them by investment returns during each year. After 5 years, you find that 11 of the funds have investment returns that place the fund in the top half of the sample in each and every year of your sample. Such consistency of performance indicates to you that these must be the funds whose managers are in fact skilled, and you invest your money in these funds.

However, the net return to the investor after 12b-1 fees will be only 9.5%. \nIn addition, there is a back-end load that reduces the sales proceeds by a percentage equal to (5 \u2013 years until sale) until the fifth year, when the back-end load expires.  \nClass A Shares Class B Shares\nHorizon $9,600\u00a03\u00a0(1.10)n$10,000\u00a03\u00a0(1.095)n\u00a03\u00a0(1\u00a02\u00a0percentage\u00a0exit\u00a0fee)\n 1 year $10,560 $10,000\u00a03\u00a0(1.095)\u00a03\u00a0(1\u00a02\u00a0.04) 5 $10,512\n 4 years $14,055 $10,000\u00a03\u00a0(1.095)4\u00a03\u00a0(1\u00a02\u00a0.01) 5 $14,233\n10 years $24,900 $10,000\u00a03\u00a0(1.095)10 5 $24,782\n   For a very short horizon such as 1 year, the Class A shares are the better choice. The front-end and \nback-end loads are equal, but the Class A shares don\u2019t have to pay the 12b-1 fees. For moderate horizons such as 4 years, the Class B shares dominate because the front-end load of the Class A shares is more costly than the 12b-1 fees and the now-smaller exit fee. For long horizons of 10 years or more, Class A again dominates. In this case, the one-time front-end load is less expensive than the continuing 12b-1 fees.  \n   3 .      a.

While we have theories about the relationship between risk and expected return that would prevail in rational capital markets, there is no theory about the levels of risk we should find in the marketplace. We can at best estimate the level of risk likely to confront investors from his-torical experience. \n This situation is to be expected because \nprices of investment assets fluctuate in response \nto news about the fortunes of corporations, as well as to macroeconomic developments. There is no theory about the frequency and impor-tance of such events; hence we cannot deter-mine a \u201cnatural\u201d level of risk. \n Compounding this difficulty is the fact that \nneither expected returns nor risk are directly \nobservable. We observe only  realized  rates of \nreturn. Hence, to make forecasts about future expected returns and risk, we must learn how to \u201cforecast\u201d their past values, that is, the expected returns and risk that investors actu-ally anticipated, from historical data. (There is an old saying that forecasting the future is even more difficult than forecasting the past.) Moreover, in learning from a historical record we face what has become known as the \u201cblack swan\u201d problem.  \n1   No matter how \nlong a historical record, there is never a guar-\nantee that it exhibits the worst (and best) that nature can throw at us in the future. This problem is particularly daunting when con-sidering the risk of long-run investments. In this chapter, we present the essential tools for estimating expected returns and risk from the historical record and consider implications for future investments.\n  \n We begin with interest rates and invest-\nments in safe assets and examine the history \nof risk-free investments in the U.S over the last 86 years. Moving to risky assets, we begin with scenario analysis of risky investments and the data inputs necessary to conduct it. With this in mind, we develop statistical tools needed to make inferences from historical time series of portfolio returns. We present a global view of the history of stock and bond returns worldwide. We end with implications of the historical record for future investments and risk measures commonly used in the industry.

For example, suppose you have $10,000 in a savings account. The bank pays you a variable interest rate tied to some short-term reference rate such as the 30-day Treasury bill rate. You have the option of moving some or all of your money into a longer-term certificate of deposit that offers a fixed rate over the term of the deposit. \n Your decision depends critically on your outlook for interest rates. If you think rates \nwill fall, you will want to lock in the current higher rates by investing in a relatively long-term CD. If you expect rates to rise, you will want to postpone committing any funds to long-term CDs. \n Forecasting interest rates is one of the most notoriously difficult parts of applied macro-\neconomics. Nonetheless, we do have a good understanding of the fundamental factors that determine the level of interest rates:\n    1. The supply of funds from savers, primarily households.  \n   2. The demand for funds from businesses to be used to finance investments in plant, \nequipment, and inventories (real assets or capital formation).  \n   3. The government\u2019s net demand for funds as modified by actions of the Federal \nReserve Bank.    \n Before we elaborate on these forces and resultant interest rates, we need to distinguish \nreal from nominal interest rates.  \n   Real and Nominal Rates of Interest \n An interest rate is a promised rate of return denominated in some unit of account (dollars, \nyen, euros, or even purchasing power units) over some time period (a month, a year, 20 years, or longer). Thus, when we say the interest rate is 5%, we must specify both the unit of account and the time period. \n Assuming there is no default risk, we can refer to the promised rate of interest as a \nrisk-free rate for that particular unit of account and time period. But if an interest rate is risk-free for one unit of account and time period, it will not be risk-free for other units or periods. For example, interest rates that are absolutely safe in dollar terms will be risky when evaluated in terms of purchasing power because of inflation uncertainty. \n To illustrate, consider a 1-year dollar (nominal) risk-free interest rate. Suppose \nexactly 1 year ago you deposited $1,000 in a 1-year time deposit guaranteeing a rate of interest of 10%. You are about to collect $1,100 in cash. What is the real return on your investment? That depends on what money can buy these days, relative to what you  could  buy a year ago. The consumer price index (CPI) measures purchasing power by \naveraging the prices of goods and services in the consumption basket of an average urban family of four. \n Suppose the rate of inflation (the percent change in the CPI, denoted by  i ) for the last year \namounted to  i \u00a0 5 \u00a06%. This tells you that the purchasing power of money is reduced by 6% \na year. The value of each dollar depreciates by 6% a year in terms of the goods it can buy. Therefore, part of your interest earnings are offset by the reduction in the purchasing power of the dollars you will receive at the end of the year. With a 10% interest rate, after you net out the 6% reduction in the purchasing power of money, you are left with a net increase in purchasing power of about 4%. Thus we need to distinguish between a    nominal \ninterest rate   \u2014the growth rate of your money\u2014and a    real interest rate   \u2014the growth rate \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   118bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   118 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 119\nof your purchasing power. If we call  rn  the nominal rate,  rr  the real rate, and  i  the inflation \nrate, then we conclude\n    rr < rn 2 i  (5.1)   \n In words, the real rate of interest is the nominal rate reduced by the loss of purchasing \npower resulting from inflation. \n In fact, the exact relationship between the real and nominal interest rate is given by   \n 1 1rr511rn\n11i  (5.2)   \n This is because the growth factor of your purchasing power, 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 rr,  equals the growth \nfactor of your money, 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 rn,  divided by the growth factor of prices, 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 i.  The exact rela-\ntionship can be rearranged to   \n rr5rn2i\n11i  (5.3)   \n which shows that the approximation rule (Equation 5.1) overstates the real rate by the \n factor 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 i.   \n If the nominal interest rate on a 1-year CD is 8%, and you expect inflation to be 5% \nover the coming year, then using the approximation formula, you expect the real rate of interest to be  rr \u00a0 5 \u00a0 8%\u00a0  2 \u00a0 5%\u00a0  5 \u00a0 3%. Using the exact formula, the real rate \nis    rr5.\n082.05\n11.055.0286,   or 2.86%. Therefore, the approximation rule overstates the \nexpected real rate by .14% (14 basis points). The approximation rule is more exact for \nsmall inflation rates and is perfectly exact for continuously compounded rates. We discuss further details in the next section.  Example 5.1 Approximating the Real Rate \n  2 You can find the  real  rate for a desired maturity from inflation-indexed bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, called \nTIPS. (See Chapter 14 for a fuller discussion.) The difference between TIPS yields and yields on comparable \nnominal Treasury bonds provides an estimate of the market\u2019s expectation of future inflation.   Notice that conventional certificates of deposit offer a guaranteed  nominal  rate of \ninterest. Thus you can only infer the expected real rate on these investments by adjusting \nfor your expectation of the rate of inflation. \n It is always possible to calculate the real rate after the fact. The inflation rate is pub-\nlished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The future real rate, however, is unknown, and one has to rely on expectations. In other words, because future inflation is risky, the real rate of return is risky even when the nominal rate is risk-free.  \n2     \n  The Equilibrium Real Rate of Interest \n Three basic factors\u2014supply, demand, and government actions\u2014determine the  real  inter-\nest rate. The nominal interest rate is the real rate plus the expected rate of inflation. And thus a fourth factor affecting the nominal interest rate is expected inflation. \n Although there are many different interest rates economywide (as many as there are types \nof debt securities), these rates tend to move together, so economists frequently talk as if \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   119bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   119 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 2 0 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nReal Interest Rate\nEquilibrium\nReal Rate\nof Interest\nEquilibrium Funds LentFundsEE'\nDemandSupply\nFigure 5.1 Determination of the equilibrium real rate of interest\n3 Experts disagree significantly on the extent to which household saving increases in response to an increase in \nthe real interest rate.there were a single rep resen-\ntative rate. We can use this \nabstraction to gain some \ninsights into the real rate of \ninterest if we consider the \nsupply and demand curves \nfor funds. \n  Figure\u00a0 5.1  shows a \ndownward-sloping demand \ncurve and an upward- \nsloping supply curve. On \nthe horizontal axis, we mea-\nsure the quantity of funds, \nand on the vertical axis, \nwe measure the real rate of \ninterest.     \n The supply curve slopes \nup from left to right because \nthe higher the real interest \nrate, the greater the supply \nof household savings. The assumption is that at higher real interest rates households will \nchoose to postpone some current consumption and set aside or invest more of their dispos-\nable income for future use.  3     \n The demand curve slopes down from left to right because the lower the real interest \nrate, the more businesses will want to invest in physical capital. Assuming that businesses \nrank projects by the expected real return on invested capital, firms will undertake more \nprojects the lower the real interest rate on the funds needed to finance those projects. \n Equilibrium is at the point of intersection of the supply and demand curves, point  E  in \n Figure\u00a05.1 . \n The government and the central bank (the Federal Reserve) can shift these supply \nand demand curves either to the right or to the left through fiscal and monetary policies. \nFor example, consider an increase in the government\u2019s budget deficit. This increases the \ngovernment\u2019s borrowing demand and shifts the demand curve to the right, which causes \nthe equilibrium real interest rate to rise to point  E  9 . That is, a forecast that indicates higher \nthan previously expected government borrowing increases expected future interest rates. The \nFed can offset such a rise through an expansionary monetary policy, which will shift the \nsupply curve to the right. \n Thus, although the fundamental determinants of the real interest rate are the propensity \nof households to save and the expected profitability of investment in physical capital, the \nreal rate can be affected as well by government fiscal and monetary policies.  \n  The Equilibrium Nominal Rate of Interest \n We\u2019ve seen that the nominal rate of return on an asset is approximately equal to the real \nrate plus inflation. Because investors should be concerned with real returns\u2014the increase \nin purchasing power\u2014we would expect higher nominal interest rates when inflation is \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   120bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   120 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 121\nhigher. This higher nominal rate is necessary to maintain the expected real return offered \nby an investment. \n Irving Fisher (1930) argued that the nominal rate ought to increase one-for-one with \nexpected inflation,  E(i ).  The so-called Fisher equation is   \n rn 5 rr 1 E(i )  (5.4)   \n The equation implies that when real rates are reasonably stable, changes in nominal rates ought to predict changes in inflation rates. This claim has been debated and empirically investigated with mixed results. Although the data do not strongly support the Fisher equation, nominal interest rates seem to predict inflation as well as alternative methods, in part because we are unable to forecast inflation well with any method. It is difficult to determine the empirical validity of the Fisher hypothesis because real rates also change unpredictably over time. Nominal interest rates can be viewed as the sum of the required real rate on nominally risk-free assets, plus a \u201cnoisy\u201d forecast of inflation. \n In Chapter 15 we discuss the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates. \nLonger rates incorporate forecasts for long-term inflation. For this reason alone, inter-est rates on bonds of different maturity may diverge. In addition, we will see that prices of longer-term bonds are more volatile than those of short-term bonds. This implies that expected returns on longer-term bonds may include a risk premium, so that the expected real rate offered by bonds of varying maturity also may vary. \n  \n     a.  Suppose the real interest rate is 3% per year and the expected inflation rate is 8%. According to the \nFisher hypothesis, what is the nominal interest rate?  \n    b.  Suppose the expected inflation rate rises to 10%, but the real rate is unchanged. What happens to the nominal interest rate?    CONCEPT CHECK 5.1 \n  Taxes and the Real Rate of Interest \n Tax liabilities are based on  nominal  income and the tax rate determined by the investor\u2019s \ntax bracket. Congress recognized the resultant \u201cbracket creep\u201d (when nominal income \ngrows due to inflation and pushes taxpayers into higher brackets) and mandated index-linked tax brackets in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. \n Index-linked tax brackets do not provide relief from the effect of inflation on the taxa-\ntion of savings, however. Given a tax rate ( t ) and a nominal interest rate,  rn,  the after-tax \ninterest rate is  rn (1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 t ). The real after-tax rate is approximately the after-tax nominal rate \nminus the inflation rate:   \n rn(1 2 t) 2 i 5 (rr 1 i)(1 2 t) 2 i 5 rr (1 2 t) 2 it  (5.5)   \n Thus the after-tax real rate falls as inflation rises. Investors suffer an inflation penalty \nequal to the tax rate times the inflation rate. If, for example, you are in a 30% tax bracket \nand your investments yield 12%, while inflation runs at the rate of 8%, then your before-tax real rate is approximately 4%, and you  should,  in an inflation-protected tax system, net \nafter taxes a real return of 4%(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.3)\u00a0 5 \u00a02.8%. But the tax code does not recognize that \nthe first 8% of your return is just compensation for inflation\u2014not real income\u2014and hence your after-tax return is reduced by 8%\u00a0 3 \u00a0.3\u00a0 5 \u00a02.4%, so that your after-tax real interest rate, \nat .4%, is almost wiped out.    \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   121bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   121 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n122 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n   5.2 Comparing Rates of Return for Different \nHolding Periods \n  Consider an investor who seeks a safe investment, say, in U.S. Treasury securities.  4   W e  \nobserve zero-coupon Treasury securities with several different maturities. Zero-coupon \nbonds, discussed more fully in Chapter 14, are sold at a discount from par value and pro-vide their entire return from the difference between the purchase price and the ultimate repayment of par value.  \n5   Given the price,  P ( T ), of a Treasury bond with $100 par value and \nmaturity of  T  years, we calculate the total risk-free return available for a horizon of  T  years \nas the percentage increase in the value of the investment.       \n rf(T)5100\nP(T)21  (5.6)   \n For  T \u00a0 5 \u00a01, Equation 5.6 provides the risk-free rate for an investment horizon of 1 year.  \n Suppose prices of zero-coupon Treasuries with $100 face value and various maturities \nare as follows.

How \nshould we compare returns on investments with differing horizons? This requires that we \nexpress each  total  return as a  rate  of return for a common period. We typically express all \ninvestment returns as an    effective annual rate (EAR),    defined as the percentage increase \nin funds invested over a 1-year horizon. \n For a 1-year investment, the EAR equals the total return,  r   f    (1), and the gross return, \n(1\u00a0  1 \u00a0 EAR), is the terminal value of a $1 investment. For investments that last less \nthan 1 year, we compound the per-period return for a full year. For the 6-month bill in \nExample\u00a05.2, we compound 2.71% half-year returns over two semiannual periods to obtain a terminal value of 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0EAR\u00a0 5 \u00a0(1.0271) \n2 \u00a0 5 \u00a01.0549, implying that EAR\u00a0 5 \u00a05.49%. \n For investments longer than a year, the convention is to express the EAR as the annual \nrate that would compound to the same value as the actual investment. For example, the \n  4 Yields on Treasury bills and bonds of various maturities are widely available on the Web, for example at Yahoo! \nFinance, MSN Money, or directly from the Federal Reserve. \n  5 The U.S. Treasury issues T-bills, which are pure discount (or zero-coupon) securities with maturities of up to \n1 year. However, financial institutions create zero-coupon Treasury bonds called Treasury strips with maturities \nup to 30 years by buying coupon-paying T-bonds, \u201cstripping\u201d off the coupon payments, and selling claims to the coupon payments and final payment of face value separately.

Conversely, we find values of EAR implied by an \nAPR of 5.8%. Example 5.4 EAR versus APR   Annual Percentage Rates \n Annualized rates on short-term investments (by convention,  T \u00a0,\u00a01\u00a0year) often are reported \nusing simple rather than compound interest. These are called    annual percentage rates,  \nor  APRs.    For example, the APR corresponding to a monthly rate such as that charged \non a credit card is reported as 12 times the monthly rate. More generally, if there are  n  \ncompounding periods in a year, and the per-period rate is  r   f   ( T  ), then the APR\u00a0 5 \u00a0 n \u00a0 3 \u00a0 r   f   ( T  ). \nConversely, you can find the per-period rate from the APR as  r   f   ( T  )\u00a0 5 \u00a0 T \u00a0 3 \u00a0APR. \n Using this procedure, the APR of the 6-month bond in Example 5.2 with a 6-month \nrate of 2.71% is 2\u00a0 3 \u00a02.71\u00a0 5 \u00a05.42%.

Put differently, what \nis the limit of [1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 T \u00a0 3 \u00a0APR] 1/  T  , as  T  gets ever smaller? As  T  approaches zero, we effec-\ntively approach  continuous compounding (CC),   and the relation of EAR to the annual \npercentage rate, denoted by  r   cc   for the continuously compounded case, is given by the \nexponential function\n    1  1 EAR 5 exp( rcc) 5 ercc  (5.9)   \n where  e  is approximately 2.71828. \n To find  r   cc   from the effective annual rate, we solve Equation 5.9 for  r   cc   as follows:\nln(1 1 EAR) 5 rcc     \n where ln(\u2022) is the natural logarithm function, the inverse of exp(\u2022). Both the exponen-\ntial and logarithmic functions are available in Excel, and are called EXP(\u2022) and LN(\u2022), \nrespectively.  \n The continuously compounded annual percentage rate,  r   cc  , that provides an EAR of 5.8% \nis 5.638% (see  Table\u00a05.1 ). This is virtually the same as the APR for daily compounding. \nBut for less frequent compounding, for example, semiannually, the APR necessary to \nprovide the same EAR is noticeably higher, 5.718%. With less frequent compounding, a \nhigher APR is necessary to provide an equivalent effective return.  Example 5.5 Continuously Compounded Rates \n While continuous compounding may at first seem to be a mathematical nuisance, work-\ning with such rates can actually simplify calculations of expected return and risk. For \nexample, given a continuously compounded rate, the total return for any period  T,   r   cc  ( T ), is \nsimply exp( T \u00a0 3 \u00a0 r   cc  ).  6   In other words, the total return scales up in direct proportion to the \ntime period,  T.

Nevertheless, nominal interest rates over \nthe recent period were still high enough to leave a higher average real rate, 0.95%, com-\npared with a paltry 10 basis points (.10%) for the earlier half.    5.3 Bills and Inflation, 1926\u20132012 \n Table 5.2 \n Statistics for \nT-bill rates, \ninflation rates, \nand real rates, \n1926\u20132012     Annualized Average Rates    Annualized Standard Deviations  *  \n    T-Bills    Inflation    Real T-Bill    T-Bills    Inflation    Real T-Bill  \n All months  3.55  3.04  0.52  2.95  4.06  3.95 \n First half  1.79  1.74  0.10  1.56  4.66  4.98 \n Recent half  5.35  4.36  0.95  3.02  2.82  2.44 \n  *Annualized standard deviations include the effect of serial correlations at lags 1\u201311 months.  \nSources: Annual rates of return from rolling over 1-month T-bills:  Kenneth French and Morningstar, Inc.; \nannual inflation rates:  Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   125bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   125 7/25/13   2:24 AM7/25/13   2:24 AMFinal PDF to printer\n1 2 6 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n An important lesson from this history is that even a moderate rate of inflation can erase \nmost of the nominal gains provided by these low-risk investments. In both halves of the \nsample, the real return was less than one-fifth the nominal return. \n We can demonstrate the cumulative gain from a particular investment over a given \nperiod using a  wealth index.   Assuming $1 was invested at the beginning of a period, we \ncompound the investment value, year by year, by 1 plus the gross annual rate of return. \nThe wealth index at the end of the last year shows the total increase in wealth per dollar \ninvested over the full investment period.  Figure\u00a05.2  shows that $1 invested in T-bills at the \nbeginning of 1970 would have grown to $9.20 by September 2012, a seemingly impres-\nsive gain for a low-risk investment. However, the wealth index in real (inflation-adjusted) \ndollars shows a meager ending value of only $1.20. Similarly, a dollar invested in T-bills \nfor the entire 1926\u20132012 period is shown (in the inset) to reach $20.25, but with a real \nvalue of only $1.55.     \n The standard deviation (SD) panel in  Table\u00a05.2  shows a lower SD of inflation in the \nrecent half, 2.82%, than in the earlier period, 4.66%. This contributed to a lower standard \ndeviation of the real rate in the recent half of the sample, 2.44%, compared with the earlier \nhalf, 4.98%. Notice that the SD of the nominal rate actually was higher in the recent period \n(3.02%) than in the earlier one (1.56%), indicating that the lower variation in realized real \nreturns must be attributed to T-bill rates more closely tracking inflation in that period. \nIndeed,  Figure\u00a05.3  documents a moderation in the rate of inflation as well as a consider-\nably tighter fit between inflation and nominal rates.     \n As we emphasized earlier, investors presumably focus on the real returns they can \nearn on their investments. For them to realize an acceptable real rate, they must earn a \nhigher nominal rate when inflation is expected to be higher. Therefore, the nominal T-bill \nrate observed at the beginning of a period should reflect anticipations of inflation over \nthat period.

At the other extreme, if investors either ignored or were very poor at predict-\ning inflation, its correlation with nominal T-bill rates would be zero and the correlation \nbetween inflation and real rates would be perfectly negative ( 2 1.0), since the real rate \nwould then fall one-for-one with any increase in inflation. \n The following table compares correlations of inflation with nominal and real T-bill rates \nin early and recent subperiods.

Holding-Period Returns \n You are considering investing in a stock-index fund. The fund currently sells for $100 per share. \nWith an investment horizon of 1 year, the realized rate of return on your investment will depend \non ( a ) the price per share at year\u2019s end and ( b ) the cash dividends you will collect over the year.    5.4 Risk and Risk Premiums \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   127bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   127 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 2 8 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n Suppose the price per share at year\u2019s end is $110 and cash dividends over the year \namount to $4. The realized return, called the  holding-period return,   HPR (in this case, the \nholding period is 1 year), is defined as   \nHPR 5Ending price of a share 2Beginning price 1Cash dividend\nBeginnin g price  (5.10)   \n Here we have   \nHPR 5$1102$1001$4\n$1005.14, or 14%    \n This definition of the HPR treats the dividend as paid at the end of the holding period. \nWhen dividends are received earlier, the HPR ignores reinvestment income between the \nreceipt of the payment and the end of the holding period. The percent return from dividends \nis called the    dividend yield,    and so dividend yield plus the rate of capital gains equals HPR.  \n  Expected Return and Standard Deviation \n There is considerable uncertainty about the price of a share plus dividend income 1 year \nfrom now, however, so you cannot be sure about your eventual HPR. We can quantify our \nbeliefs about the state of the market and the stock-index fund in terms of four possible \nscenarios with probabilities as presented in columns A through E of  Spreadsheet\u00a05.1 . \n How can we evaluate this probability distribution? To start, we characterize probability \ndistributions of rates of return by their expected or mean return,  E ( r ), and standard devia-\ntion,  s . The expected rate of return is a probability-weighted average of the rates of return \nin each scenario. Calling  p ( s ) the probability of each scenario and  r ( s ) the HPR in each \nscenario, where scenarios are labeled or \u201cindexed\u201d by  s,  we write the expected return as   \n E(r)5a\nsp(s)r(s)  (5.11)   \n Applying this formula to the data in  Spreadsheet\u00a05.1 , the expected rate of return on the \nindex fund is   \n E(r)5(.253.31)1(.453.14)13.253(2.0675 )413.053(2.52)45.0976   \nAB C D E F H GI\nPurchase Price 5 $100\nState of the\nMarket Probability\nExcellent\nGood\nPoor\n0.050.25\n0.45\n0.25\nExpected Value (mean)\nStandard Deviation of HPRVariance of HPRCrashYear-End\nPrice\n46.00126.50\n110.00\n89.75\n2.004.50\n4.00\n3.50\n20.56000.2700\n0.1000\n20.1075\n0.38150.0451\n0.0018\n0.0273\n20.52000.3100\n0.1400\n20.0675Cash\nDividendsT-bill Rate 50.04\nHPR\n20.61760.2124\n0.0424\n20.1651Squared\nDeviations\nfrom MeanDeviations\nfrom Mean\n0.38150.0451\n0.0018\n0.0273\n0.0380\n0.19490.0976Excess\nReturnsSquared\nDeviations\nfrom Mean1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16SUMPRODUCT (B8:B11, E8:E11) 5\nSUMPRODUCT (B8:B11, G8:G11) 5\nSQRT(G13)  5\n0.0576 Risk Premium\nStandard Deviation of Excess Return 0.1949 SQRT(SUMPRODUCT (B8:B11, I8:I11)) 5SUMPRODUCT (B8:B11, H8:H11) 5\n Spreadsheet 5.1\nScenario analysis of holding period return of the stock-index fund  eXcel\nPlease visit us at \nwww.mhhe.com/bkm\nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   128bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   128 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 129\n  Spreadsheet\u00a0 5.1  shows that this sum can be evaluated easily in Excel, using the \nSUMPRODUCT function, which first calculates the products of a series of number pairs, and then sums the products. Here, the number pair is the probability of each scenario and the rate of return.  \n The standard deviation of the rate of return ( s ) is a measure of risk. It is defined as the \nsquare root of the variance, which in turn is the expected value of the squared deviations from the expected return. The higher the volatility in outcomes, the higher will be the aver-age value of these squared deviations. Therefore, variance and standard deviation provide one measure of the uncertainty of outcomes. Symbolically,   \n s\n25a\nsp(s)3r(s)2E(r)42  (5.12)   \n Therefore, in our example   \n  s25.25(.312.0976 )21.45(.142.0976 )21.25(2.0675 2.0976 )2 \n 1.05(2.522.0976 )25.0380   \n This value is calculated in cell G13 of  Spreadsheet\u00a05.1  using the SUMPRODUCT func-\ntion. The standard deviation is calculated in cell G14 as   \ns5\".0380 5.1949 519.49%  \n Clearly, what would trouble potential investors in the index fund is the downside risk \nof a crash or poor market, not the upside potential of a good or excellent market. The stan-dard deviation of the rate of return does not distinguish between good or bad surprises; it treats both simply as deviations from the mean. As long as the probability distribution is more or less symmetric about the mean,  s  is a reasonable measure of risk. In the special \ncase where we can assume that the probability distribution is normal\u2014represented by the well-known bell-shaped curve\u2014 E ( r ) and  s  completely characterize the distribution.  \n  Excess Returns and Risk Premiums \n How much, if anything, should you invest in our index fund? First, you must ask how much of an expected reward is offered for the risk involved in investing money in stocks. \n We measure the reward as the difference between the  expected  HPR on the index stock \nfund and the    risk-free rate,    that is, the rate you can earn by leaving money in risk-free \nassets such as T-bills, money market funds, or the bank. We call this difference the    risk \npremium    on common stocks. The risk-free rate in our example is 4% per year, and the expected index fund return is 9.76%, so the risk premium on stocks is 5.76% per year. The difference in any particular period between the  actual  rate of return on a risky asset \nand the actual risk-free rate is called the    excess return.    Therefore, the risk premium is the \nexpected value of the excess return, and the standard deviation of the excess return is a measure of its risk. (See  Spreadsheet\u00a05.1  for these calculations.) \n The degree to which investors are willing to commit funds to stocks depends on    risk \naversion.    Investors are risk averse in the sense that, if the risk premium were zero, they would not invest any money in stocks. In theory, there must always be a positive risk premium on stocks in order to induce risk-averse investors to hold the existing supply of stocks instead of placing all their money in risk-free assets. \n Although the scenario analysis illustrates the concepts behind the quantification of risk \nand return, you may still wonder how to get a more realistic estimate of  E ( r ) and  s  for \ncommon stocks and other types of securities. Here, history has insights to offer. Analysis of the historical record of portfolio returns makes use of a variety of concepts and statisti-cal tools, and so we first turn to a preparatory discussion. \n    \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   129bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   129 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n130 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n You invest $27,000 in a corporate bond selling for $900 per $1,000 par value. Over the coming year, the \nbond will pay interest of $75 per $1,000 of par value. The price of the bond at year\u2019s end will depend on the level of interest rates that will prevail at that time. You construct the following scenario analysis: \nInterest Rates Probability Year-End Bond Price\nHigh .2 $850\nUnchanged .5  915\nLow .3  985\n Your alternative investment is a T-bill that yields a sure rate of return of 5%. Calculate the HPR for each \nscenario, the expected rate of return, and the risk premium on your investment. What is the expected end-of-year dollar value of your investment?  CONCEPT CHECK 5.3 \n   Time Series versus Scenario Analysis \n In a forward-looking scenario analysis we determine a set of relevant scenarios and asso-\nciated investment rates of return, assign probabilities to each, and conclude by comput-ing the risk premium (reward) and standard deviation (risk) of the proposed investment. In contrast, asset return histories come in the form of time series of realized returns that do not explicitly provide investors\u2019 original assessments of the probabilities of those returns; we observe only dates and associated HPRs. We must infer from this limited data the prob-ability distributions from which these returns might have been drawn or, at least, expected return and standard deviation.  \n  Expected Returns and the Arithmetic Average \n When we use historical data, we treat each observation as an equally likely \u201cscenario.\u201d So if there are  n  observations, we substitute equal probabilities of 1/ n  for each  p ( s ) in \nEquation 5.11. The expected return,  E ( r ), is then estimated by the arithmetic average of the \nsample rates of return:   \nE(r)5an\ns51p(s)r(s)51\nnan\ns51r(s) \n(5.13)\n 5Arithmetic avera ge of rates of return         5.5 Time Series Analysis of Past Rates of Return \n To illustrate,  Spreadsheet\u00a05.2  presents a (very short) time series of annual holding-period \nreturns for the S&P 500 index over the period 2001\u20132005. We treat each HPR of the \n n \u00a0 5 \u00a05 observations in the time series as an equally likely annual outcome during the sam-\nple years and assign it an equal probability of 1/5, or .2. Column B in  Spreadsheet\u00a05.2  \ntherefore uses .2 as probabilities, and Column C shows the annual HPRs. Applying \nEquation 5.13 (using Excel\u2019s SUMPRODUCT function) to the time series in  Spread-\nsheet\u00a05.2  demonstrates that adding up the products of probability times HPR amounts \nto taking the arithmetic average of the HPRs (compare cells C10 and C11).  Example 5.6 Arithmetic Average and Expected Return \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   130bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   130 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 131\n Example 5.6 illustrates the logic for the wide use of the arithmetic average in invest-\nments. If the time series of historical returns fairly represents the true underlying prob-\nability distribution, then the arithmetic average return from a historical period provides a \nforecast of the investment\u2019s expected future HPR.  \n  The Geometric (Time-Weighted) Average Return \n The arithmetic average provides an unbiased estimate of the  expected   future return. But \nwhat does the time series tell us about the  actual   performance of a portfolio over the  past\nsample period? Let\u2019s continue Example 5.6 using its very short sample period just to illus-\ntrate. We will present results for meaningful periods later in the chapter. \n Column F in  Spreadsheet\u00a05.2  shows the wealth index from investing $1 in an S&P 500 \nindex fund at the beginning of 2001. The value of the wealth index at the end of 2005, \n$1.0275, is the terminal value of the $1 investment, which implies a  5 - year  holding-period \nreturn (HPR) of 2.75%. \n An intuitive measure of performance over the sample period is the (fixed) annual HPR \nthat would compound over the period to the same terminal value as obtained from the \nsequence of actual returns in the time series. Denote this rate by  g,  so that   \nTerminal value 5 (1 1 r1) 3 (1 1 r2) 3\u00a0? ? ?\u00a03 (1 1 r5) 5 1.0275\n(1 1 g)n 5 Terminal value 5 1.0275 (cell F9 in Spreadsheet 5.2)  (5.14)   \ng5 Terminal value1/n 2 1 5 1.0751/5 2 1 5 .0054 5 .54% (cell E14)\n where 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 g  is the geometric average of the gross returns (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r ) from the time series \n(which can be computed with Excel\u2019s GEOMEAN function) and  g  is the annual HPR that \nwould replicate the final value of our investment.  \n Practitioners call  g  the  time-weighted   (as opposed to dollar-weighted) average return, \nto emphasize that each past return receives an equal weight in the process of averaging. \nThis distinction is important because investment managers often experience significant \nchanges in funds under management as investors purchase or redeem shares. Rates of \nreturn obtained during periods when the fund is large produce larger dollar profits than \nrates obtained when the fund is small. We discuss this distinction in the chapter on perfor-\nmance evaluation. \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15AB C D E F\nPeriodImplicitly Assumed\nProbability = 1/5Squared\nDeviationGross HPR =\n1 + HPRWealth\nIndex*\n2001 .2 \u22120.1189 0.0196\n0.0586\n0.0707\n0.0077\n0.17740.0008\n0.19830.8811 0.8811\n0.6864\n0.8833\n0.9794\n1.0275\nCheck:\n1.0054^5=0.7790\n1.2869\n1.1088\n1.0491\n0.0054 1.0275\u22120.2210\n0.2869\n0.1088\n0.0491\n0.0210\n0.0210HPR (decimal)\n.2\n.2\n.2\n.22002\n2003\n2004\n2005\nArithmetic average\nExpected HPR SUMPRODUCT(B5:B9, C5:C9) =\nSUMPRODUCT(B5:B9, D5:D9)^.5 =\nSTDEV(C5:C9) =\nGeometric average return\n*The value of $1 invested at the beginning of the sample period (1/1/2001).GEOMEAN(E5:E9) \u2212 1 =Standard deviationAVERAGE(C5:C9) =\n Spreadsheet 5.2\nTime series of HPR for the S&P 500  eXcel\nPlease visit us at \nwww.mhhe.com/bkm\nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   131bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   131 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n132 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n The larger the swings in rates of return, the greater the discrepancy between the arith-\nmetic and geometric averages, that is, between the compound rate earned over the sample \nperiod and the average of the annual returns. If returns come from a normal distribution, the expected difference is exactly half the variance of the distribution, that is,   \n E3Geometric avera\nge45E3Arithmetic avera ge42\u00bds2  (5.15)   \n (A warning: To use Equation 5.15, you must express returns as decimals, not percentages.) \nWhen returns are approximately normal, Equation 5.15 will be a good approximation.  9       \n  Variance and Standard Deviation \n When thinking about risk, we are interested in the likelihood of deviations from the \n expected  return. In practice, we usually cannot directly observe expectations, so we esti-\nmate the variance by averaging squared deviations from our  estimate  of the expected  The geometric average in Example 5.6 (.54%) is substantially less than the arithmetic \naverage (2.10%). This discrepancy sometimes is a source of confusion. It arises from the asymmetric effect of positive and negative rates of returns on the terminal value of the portfolio. \n Observe the returns in years 2002 ( 2 .2210) and 2003 (.2869). The arithmetic aver-\nage return over the 2 years is ( 2 .2210\u00a0 1 \u00a0.2869)/2\u00a0 5 \u00a0.03295\u00a0(3.295%). However, if \nyou had invested $100 at the beginning of 2002, you would have only $77.90 at the \nend of the year. In order to simply break even, you would then have needed to earn $21.10 in 2003, which would amount to a whopping return of 27.09% (21.10/77.90). Why is such a high rate necessary to break even, rather than the 22.10% you lost in 2002? The value of your investment in 2003 was much smaller than $100; the lower base means that it takes a greater subsequent percentage gain to just break even. Even a rate as high as the 28.69% realized in 2003 yields a portfolio value in 2003 of $77.90\u00a0 3 \u00a01.2869\u00a0 5 \u00a0$100.25, barely greater than $100. This implies a 2-year annually \ncompounded rate (the geometric average) of only .12%, significantly less than the arith-metic average of 3.295%.  Example 5.7 Geometric versus Arithmetic Average \n You invest $1 million at the beginning of 2018 in an S&P 500 stock-index fund. Given the rate of return for \n2018,  2 40%, what rate of return in 2019 will be necessary for your portfolio to recover to its original value?  CONCEPT CHECK 5.4 \n  9 We are told to measure historical performance over a particular sample period by the  geometric  average but to \nestimate expected future performance from that same sample as the  arithmetic  average. The question naturally \narises: If the same sample were to recur in the future, performance would be measured by the  geometric  aver-\nage, so isn\u2019t that the best estimator of expected return? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Future results will always \ncontain both positive and negative surprises compared to prior expectations. When compounded, a run of positive surprises has greater impact on final wealth than a run of equal-sized negative ones. Because of this asymmetry, the sample geometric average is actually a downward-biased estimate of the future average return drawn from the same distribution. The bias turns out to be half the variance, and thus using the arithmetic average corrects for this bias. \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   132bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   132 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 133\nreturn, the arithmetic average,    r .

The reason \nis that we have taken deviations from the sample arithmetic average,    r , instead of the \nunknown, true expected value,  E ( r ), and so have introduced an estimation error. Its effect \non the estimated variance is sometimes called a  degrees of freedom  bias. We can elimi-\nnate the bias by multiplying the arithmetic average of squared deviations by the factor \n n /( n \u00a0 2 \u00a01). The variance and standard deviation then become   \n s^25an\nn21b31\nnan\ns513r(s)2r4251\nn21an\ns513r(s)2r42\n s^5\u00c51\nn21an\ns513r(s)2r42  (5.17)\n   \n Cell D13 shows the unbiased estimate of standard deviation, .1983, which is higher than \nthe .1774 value obtained in cell D12. For large samples,  n /( n \u00a0 2 \u00a01) is close to 1, and the \nadjustment for degrees of freedom becomes trivially small.  \n  Mean and Standard Deviation Estimates \nfrom Higher-Frequency Observations \n Do more frequent observations lead to more accurate estimates? The answer to this ques-\ntion is surprising: Observation frequency has no impact on the accuracy of mean estimates. It is the  duration  of a sample time series (as opposed to the  number  of observations) that \nimproves accuracy. \n The total 10-year return divided by 10 is as accurate an estimate of the expected annual \nreturn as 12 times the average of 120 monthly returns. The average monthly return must be consistent with the average 10-year return, so the extra intra-year observations yield no additional information about average return. However, a longer sample, for example, a 100-year return, will provide a more accurate estimate of the mean return than a 10-year return,  provided  the probability distribution of returns remains unchanged over the 100 years. \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   133bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   133 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n134 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nThis suggests a rule: Use the longest sample that you still believe comes from the same \nreturn distribution. Unfortunately, in practice, old data may be less informative. Are return data from the 19th century relevant to estimating expected returns in the 21st century? Quite possibly not, implying that we face severe limits to the accuracy of our estimates of mean returns. \n In contrast to the mean, the accuracy of estimates of the standard deviation and \nhigher moments (all computed using  deviations from the average ) can be made more \nprecise by increasing the number of observations. Thus, we can improve accuracy of estimates of SD and higher moments of the distribution by using more frequent observations. \n Estimates of standard deviation begin with the variance. When monthly returns are \nuncorrelated from one month to another, monthly variances simply add up. Thus, when the variance is the same every month, we annualize by:  \n10      sA2512s M2.  In general, the  T -month \nvariance is  T  times the 1-month variance. Consequently, standard deviation grows at the \nrate of    \" T,  that is:    sA5\"12sM.  While the mean and variance grow in direct proportion \nto time, SD grows at the rate of square root of time.   \n  The Reward-to-Volatility (Sharpe) Ratio \n Finally, it is worth noting that investors presumably are interested in the expected \n excess  return they can earn by replacing T-bills with a risky portfolio, as well as the \nrisk they would thereby incur. While the T-bill rate is not constant over the entire period, we still know with certainty what nominal rate we will earn if we purchase a bill and hold it to maturity. Other investments typically entail accepting some risk in return for the prospect of earning more than the safe T-bill rate. Investors price risky assets so that the risk premium will be commensurate with the risk of that expected  excess  return, and hence it\u2019s best to measure risk by the standard deviation of excess, \nnot total, returns. \n The importance of the trade-off between reward (the risk premium) and risk (as mea-\nsured by standard deviation or SD) suggests that we measure the attraction of a portfolio by the ratio of risk premium to SD of excess returns.   \n Sharpe ratio 5Risk premium\nSD of excess return  (5.18)   \n This reward-to-volatility measure (first proposed by William Sharpe and hence called the \n Sharpe ratio ) is widely used to evaluate the performance of investment managers. \n Notice that the Sharpe ratio divides the risk premium (which rises in direct proportion \nto time) by the standard deviation (which rises in direct proportion to square root of unit of \ntime). Therefore, the Sharpe ratio will be higher when annualized from higher frequency returns. For example, to annualize the Sharpe ratio (SR) from monthly rates, we multiply \nthe numerator by 12 and the denominator by    \"12\n.  Hence the annualized Sharpe ratio is \nSRA 5 SRM    \"12 . In general, the Sharpe ratio of a long-term investment over  T  years will \nincrease by a factor of    \"T  when  T -period rates replace annual rates.      \n  10 When returns are uncorrelated, we do not have to worry about covariances among them. Therefore, the variance \nof the sum of 12 monthly returns (i.e., the variance of the annual return) is the sum of the 12 monthly variances. \nIf returns are correlated across months, annualizing is more involved and requires adjusting for the structure of serial correlation. \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   134bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   134 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 135\n   5.6 The Normal Distribution \n  The bell-shaped    normal distribution    appears naturally in many applications. For exam-\nple, heights and weights of newborns are well described by the normal distribution. In fact, many variables that are the end result of multiple random influences will exhibit a normal distribution, for example, the error of a machine that aims to fill containers with exactly 1 gallon of liquid. By the same logic, if return expectations implicit in asset prices are rational, actual rates of return should be normally distributed around these expectations. \n To see why the normal curve is \u201cnormal,\u201d consider a newspaper stand that turns a profit \nof $100 on a good day and breaks even on a bad day, with equal probabilities of .5. Thus, the mean daily profit is $50 dollars. We can build a tree that compiles all the possible outcomes at the end of any period. Here is an    event tree    showing outcomes after 2 days:  \n   \nTwo good days, profit = $200\nTwo bad days, profit = 0One good and one bad day, profit = $100\n Notice that 2 days can produce three different outcomes and, in general,  n  days can \nproduce  n \u00a0 1 \u00a0 1 possible outcomes. The most likely 2-day outcome is \u201cone good and  Take another look at  Spreadsheet\u00a05.1 . The scenario analysis for the proposed investment \nin the stock-index fund resulted in a risk premium of 5.76%, and standard deviation \nof excess returns of 19.49%. This implies a Sharpe ratio of .30, a value in line with the historical performance of stock-index funds. We will see that while the Sharpe ratio is an adequate measure of the risk\u2013return trade-off for diversified portfolios (the subject of this chapter), it is inadequate when applied to individual assets such as shares of stock.

The \nprobability of this outcome is .5. Less likely are the two extreme outcomes (both good \ndays or both bad days) with probability .25 each. \n What is the distribution of profits at the end of 200 days? There are 201 possible out-\ncomes and, again, the midrange outcomes are the most likely because there are more \nsequences that lead to them. While only one sequence can result in 200 consecutive bad \ndays, an enormous number of sequences result in 100 good days and 100 bad days. The \nprobability distribution will eventually take on the familiar bell shape.  11    \n  Figure\u00a05.4  shows a graph of the normal curve with mean of 10% and standard deviation \nof 20%. A smaller SD means that possible outcomes cluster more tightly around the mean, \nwhile a higher SD implies more diffuse distributions. The likelihood of realizing any \nparticular outcome when sampling from a normal distribution is fully determined by the \nnumber of standard deviations that separate that outcome from the mean. Put differently, \nthe normal distribution is completely characterized by two parameters, the mean and SD.     \n Investment management is far more tractable when rates of return can be well approxi-\nmated by the normal distribution. First, the normal distribution is symmetric, that is, the \nprobability of any positive deviation above the mean is equal to that of a negative devia-\ntion of the same magnitude. Absent symmetry, measuring risk as the standard deviation \nof returns is inadequate. Second, the normal distribution belongs to a special family of \ndistributions characterized as \u201cstable,\u201d because of the following property: When assets \nwith normally distributed returns are mixed to construct a portfolio, the portfolio return \nalso is normally distributed. Third, scenario analysis is greatly simplified when only two \nparameters (mean and SD) need to be estimated to obtain the probabilities of future sce-\nnarios.   Fourth, when constructing portfolios of securities, we must account for the statis-\ntical dependence of returns across securities. Generally, such dependence is a complex, \n23s2 2s2 1s 0 11s1 2s1 3s\n250 230 210 30 50 7068.26%\n95.44%\n99.74%\n10\nFigure 5.4 The normal distribution with mean 10% and standard deviation 20%.\n11 Early descriptions of the normal distribution in the 18th century were based on the outcomes of a \u201cbinomial \ntree\u201d like that of the newspaper stand. This representation is used in practice to price many option contracts, as we \nwill see in Chapter 21.

But when securities are normally distributed, the statistical rela-\ntionships between returns can be summarized with a straightforward correlation coeffi-cient. Thus we need to estimate only one parameter to summarize the dependence of any two securities. \n How closely must actual return distributions fit the normal curve to justify its use in \ninvestment management? Clearly, the normal curve cannot be a perfect description of real-ity. For example, actual returns cannot be less than  2 100%, which the normal distribution \nwould not rule out. But this does not mean that the normal curve cannot still be useful. A similar issue arises in many other contexts. For example, birth weight is typically evalu-ated in comparison to a normal curve of newborn weights, although no baby is born with a negative weight. The normal distribution still is useful here because the SD of the weight is small relative to its mean, and the likelihood of a negative weight would be too trivial to matter.  \n12   In a similar spirit, we must identify criteria to determine the adequacy of the \nnormality assumption for rates of return.        \n Suppose the monthly rate of return on the S&P 500 is approximately normally distrib-\nuted with a mean of 1% and standard deviation of 6%. What is the probability that the return on the index in any month will be negative? We can use Excel\u2019s built-in func-tions to quickly answer this question. The probability of observing an outcome less than some cutoff according to the normal distribution function is given as NORMDIST(cutoff, mean, standard deviation, TRUE). In this case, we want to know the probability of an outcome below zero, when the mean is 1% and the standard deviation is 6%, so we compute NORMDIST(0,\u00a01,\u00a06,\u00a0TRUE)\u00a0 5 \u00a0.4338. We could also use Excel\u2019s built-in  standard  \nnormal function, NORMSDIST, which uses a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and ask for the probability of an outcome 1/6 of a standard deviation below the mean: NORMSDIST( 2 1/6)\u00a0 5 \u00a0.4338.  Example 5.10 Normal Distribution Function in Excel \n What is the probability that the return on the index in Example 5.10 will be below  2 15%?  CONCEPT CHECK 5.6 \n 12 In fact, the standard deviation is 511 grams while the mean is 3,958 grams. A negative weight would therefore \nbe 7.74 standard deviations below the mean, and according to the normal distribution would have probability of \nonly 4.97\u00a0 3 \u00a010  2 15 . The issue of negative birth weight clearly isn\u2019t a  practical  concern.  As we noted earlier (but you can\u2019t repeat it too often!), normality of excess returns hugely \nsimplifies portfolio selection. Normality assures us that standard deviation is a complete measure of risk and hence the Sharpe ratio is a complete measure of portfolio performance. Unfortunately, deviations from normality of asset returns are quite significant and difficult to ignore. \n Deviations from normality may be discerned by calculating the higher moments of \nreturn distributions. The  n th central moment of a distribution of excess returns,  R,  is esti-\nmated as the average value of    (R2R\n)n.  The first moment ( n \u00a0 5 \u00a0 1) is necessarily zero    5.7 Deviations from Normality and Risk Measures \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   137bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   137 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 3 8 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n(the average deviation from the sample average \nmust be zero). The second moment ( n \u00a0 5 \u00a02) is \nthe estimate of the variance of returns,    s^2.   13    \n A measure of asymmetry called    skew    uses \nthe ratio of the average  cubed   deviations from \nthe average, called the third moment, to the \ncubed standard deviation to measure asymme-\ntry or \u201cskewness\u201d of a distribution.   \n Skew 5Average B(R2R)3\ns^3R  (5.19)   \n Cubing deviations maintains their sign (the \ncube of a negative number is negative). When \na distribution is \u201cskewed to the right,\u201d as is the \ndark curve in  Figure\u00a0 5.5A , the extreme posi-\ntive values, when cubed, dominate the third \nmoment, resulting in a positive skew. When a \ndistribution is \u201cskewed to the left,\u201d the cubed \nextreme negative values dominate, and the \nskew will be negative.  \n When the distribution is positively skewed (skewed \nto the right), the standard deviation overestimates \nrisk, because extreme positive surprises (which do not \nconcern investors) nevertheless increase the estimate \nof volatility. Conversely, and more important, when \nthe distribution is negatively skewed, the SD will \nunderestimate risk. \n Another potentially important deviation from nor-\nmality, kurtosis, concerns the likelihood of extreme \nvalues on either side of the mean at the expense \nof a smaller likelihood of moderate deviations. \nGraphically speaking, when the tails of a distribu-\ntion are \u201cfat,\u201d there is more probability mass in the \ntails of the distribution than predicted by the normal \ndistribution, at the expense of \u201cslender shoulders,\u201d \nthat is, less probability mass near the center of the \ndistribution.  Figure\u00a05.5B  superimposes a \u201cfat-tailed\u201d \ndistribution on a normal with the same mean and SD. \nAlthough symmetry is still preserved, the SD will \nunderestimate the likelihood of extreme events: large \nlosses as well as large gains.  \n13 For distributions that are symmetric about the average, as is the case for the normal distribution, all odd \nmoments ( n \u00a0 5 \u00a01,\u00a03,\u00a05,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.) have expectations of zero. For the normal distribution, the expectations of all higher \neven moments ( n \u00a0 5 \u00a04,\u00a06,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.) are functions  only  of the standard deviation,  s . For example, the expected fourth \nmoment ( n \u00a0 5 \u00a04) is 3 s  4 , and for  n \u00a0 5 \u00a06, it is 15 s  6 . Thus, for normally distributed returns the standard devia-\ntion,  s , provides a complete measure of risk, and portfolio performance may be measured by the Sharpe ratio, \n   R/s.  For other distributions, however, asymmetry may be measured by higher nonzero odd moments. Higher \neven moments (in excess of those consistent with the normal distribution), combined with large, negative odd \nmoments, indicate higher probabilities of extreme negative outcomes. \n Figure 5.5A Normal and skewed distributions \n(mean\u00a0 5 \u00a06%,\u00a0SD\u00a0 5 \u00a017%)    \n.00\nRate of Return.20 .40 .60 \u2212.60 Probability\n\u2212.40 \u2212.20.030\n.025\n.020\n.015\n.010\n.005\n.000Skew = \u2212.75Skew = .75Negatively Skewed\nNormalPositively Skewed\n Figure 5.5B Normal and fat-tailed distributions \n(mean\u00a0 5 \u00a0.1,\u00a0SD\u00a0 5 \u00a0.2)    \n\u2212.4 \u2212.2 \u2212.6 .2 .4 .6 0\nRate of ReturnKurtosis\n=.35Probability Density\n.8Normal\nFat-Tailed\n.00.10.20.30.50\n.40.60\nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   138bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   138 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 139\n    Kurtosis    measures the degree of fat tails. We use deviations from the average raised to \nthe  fourth  power, scaled by the fourth power of the SD,   \n Kurtosis 5Average B(R2R)4\ns^4R23  (5.20)   \n We subtract 3 in Equation 5.20, because the ratio for a \nnormal distribution is 3. Thus, the kurtosis of a normal distribution is defined as zero, and any kurtosis above zero is a sign of fatter tails. The kurtosis of the distribu-tion in  Figure\u00a05.5B , which has visible fat tails, is .35. \n In addition to a shift of observations between the \nshoulders and the tails, kurtosis can be affected by a shift from the shoulders to the center of the distribution (which decreases kurtosis), or vice versa. This element of kurtosis is called  peakedness,  as it affects the height of the peak of \nthe distribution at its center. It is not shown in  Figure\u00a05.5B , but we often encounter peaked-ness in histograms of actual distributions. \n Notice that both skew and kurtosis are pure numbers. They do not change when annual-\nized from higher frequency observations. \n \n Higher frequency of extreme negative returns may result from negative skew and/or \nkurtosis (fat tails). Therefore, we would like a risk measure that indicates vulnerability to extreme negative returns. We discuss four such measures that are most frequently used in practice: value at risk, expected shortfall, lower partial standard deviation, and the frequency of extreme (3-sigma) returns.  \n   Value at Risk \n The    value at risk    (denoted  VaR   to distinguish it from  Var,  the abbreviation for vari-\nance) is the loss corresponding to a very low percentile of the entire return distribution, for example, the 5th or 1st percentile return. VaR is actually written into regulation of banks and closely watched by risk managers. It is another name for  quantile  of a \ndistribution. The quantile,  q,  of a distribution is the value below which lies  q % of the \npossible values. Thus the median is  q \u00a0 5 \u00a050th quantile. Practitioners commonly estimate \nthe 5% VaR, meaning that 95% of returns will exceed the VaR, and 5% will be worse. Therefore, the 5% VaR may be viewed as the best rate of return out of the 5%  worst-\ncase  future scenarios. \n When portfolio returns are normally distributed, the VaR is determined by the mean and \nSD of the distribution. Recalling that  2 1.65 is the 5th percentile of the standard normal \ndistribution (with mean\u00a0 5 \u00a00 and SD\u00a0 5 \u00a01), the VaR for a normal distribution is   \nVaR(.05, normal) 5 Mean 2 1.65 SD  \n To obtain a sample estimate of VaR, we sort the observations from high to low. The VaR is the return at the 5th percentile of the sample distribution. Almost always, 5% of the  number of observations will not be an integer, and so we must interpolate. Suppose a sample comprises 84 annual returns so that 5% of the number of observations is 4.2. We must interpolate between the fourth and fifth observation from the bottom. Suppose the bottom five returns are   \n225.03% 2 25.69% 2 33.49% 2 41.03% 2 45.64%  \n The VaR is therefore between  2 25.03% and  2 25.69% and would be calculated as   \nVaR 5 225.69 1 0.2(25.69 2 25.03) 5 225.56%    Estimate the skew and kurtosis of the five rates \nin  Spreadsheet\u00a05.2 .

A more realistic view of downside exposure would focus instead on the  expected  loss given \nthat we find ourselves in one of the worst-case scenarios. This value, unfortunately, has two names: either    expected shortfall (ES)    or    conditional tail expectation (CTE);    the \nlatter emphasizes that this expectation is conditioned on being in the left tail of the distri-bution. ES is the more commonly used terminology. \n Extending the previous VaR example, we assume equal probabilities for all values. \nHence, we need to average across the bottom 5% of the observations. We sum the bottom 4 returns plus 0.2 of the fifth from the bottom, and divide by 4.2 to find ES\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 35.94%, \nsignificantly less than the  2 25.56% VaR.  \n14     \n  Lower Partial Standard Deviation and the Sortino Ratio \n The use of standard deviation as a measure of risk when the return distribution is non-normal presents two problems: (1) the asymmetry of the distribution suggests we should look at negative outcomes separately; and (2) because an alternative to a risky portfolio is a risk-free investment, we should look at deviations of returns from the risk-free rate rather than from the sample average, that is, at negative excess returns. \n A risk measure that addresses these issues is the    lower partial standard deviation \n(LPSD)    of excess returns, which is computed like the usual standard deviation, but using \nonly \u201cbad\u201d returns. Specifically, it uses only negative deviations from the risk-free rate (rather than negative deviations from the sample average), squares those deviations to obtain an analog to variance, and then takes the square root to obtain a \u201cleft-tail standard devia-tion.\u201d The LPSD is therefore the square root of the average squared deviation,  conditional  on \na negative excess return. Notice that this measure ignores the frequency of negative excess returns, that is, portfolios with the same average squared negative excess returns will yield the same LPSD regardless of the relative frequency of negative excess returns. \n Practitioners who replace standard deviation with this LPSD typically also replace the \nSharpe ratio (the ratio of average excess return to standard deviation) with the ratio of aver-age excess returns to LPSD. This variant on the Sharpe ratio is called the    Sortino ratio.     \n  Relative Frequency of Large, Negative 3-Sigma Returns \n Here we concentrate on the relative frequency of large, negative returns compared with those frequencies in a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. Extreme returns are often called  jumps,  as the stock price makes a big sudden movement. We compare \nthe fraction of observations with returns 3 or more standard deviations below the mean to the relative frequency of negative 3-sigma returns in the corresponding normal distribution. \n  14 A formula for the ES in the case of normally distributed returns is given in Jonathan Treussard, \u201cThe Non-\nmonotonicity of Value-at-Risk and the Validity of Risk Measures over Different Horizons,\u201d  IFCAI Journal of \nFinancial Risk Management,  March 2007. The formula is   \nES51\n.05 exp(m)N32s2F(.95)421  \n where  m  is the mean of the continuously compounded returns,  s  is the SD,  N (\u2022\u00a0) is the cumulative standard nor-\nmal, and  F  is its inverse. In the sample above,  m  and  s  were estimated as 5.47% and 19.54%. Assuming normal-\nity, we would have ES\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 30.57%, suggesting that this distribution has a larger left tail than the normal. It should \nbe noted, however, that estimates of VaR and ES from historical samples, while unbiased, are subject to large \nestimation errors because they are estimated from a small number of extreme returns. \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   140bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   140 6/18/13   8:03 PM6/18/13   8:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\nSome Funds Stop Grading on the Curve\nIn 2008 a typical investment portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% \nbonds lost roughly a fifth of its value. Standard portfolio-construction tools assume that will happen only once every 111 years. Though mathematicians and many investors have long known market behavior isn\u2019t a pretty picture, standard portfolio construction assumes returns fall along a tidy, bell-curve-shaped distribution. With that approach, a 2008-type decline would fall near the skinny left tail, indicating its rarity.\nRecent history would suggest such meltdowns aren\u2019t so \nrare. In a little more than two decades, investors have been buffeted by the 1987 market crash, the implosion of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, the bursting of the tech-stock bubble, and other crises.\nMany of Wall Street\u2019s new tools assume market returns \nfall along a \u201cfat-tailed\u201d distribution, where, say, the nearly 40% stock-market decline in 2008 would be more common than previously thought. These new assumptions present a far different picture of risk. Consider the 60% stock, 40% bond portfolio that fell about 20%. Under the fat-tailed distribution, that should occur once every 40 years, not once every 111 years as assumed under a bell-curve-type distribution. (The last year as bad as 2008 was 1931.)\nOne potential pitfall: Number-crunchers have a smaller \nsupply of historical observations to construct models focused on rare events. \u201cData are intrinsically sparse,\u201d says Lisa Goldberg, executive director of analytic initiatives at MSCI Barra.\nMany of the new tools also limit the role of conven-\ntional risk measures. Standard deviation, proposed as a risk measure by Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Harry Markowitz in the 1950s, can be used to gauge how much an investment\u2019s returns vary over time. But it is equally affected by upside and downside moves, whereas many investors fear losses much more than they value gains. And it doesn\u2019t fully gauge risk in a fat-tailed world.\nA newer measure that has gained prominence in recent \ndecades ignores potential gains and looks at downside risk. That measure, called \u201cvalue at risk,\u201d might tell you that you have a 5% chance of losing 3% or more in a single day, but it doesn\u2019t home in on the worst downside scenarios.\nTo focus on extreme risk, many firms have begun using \na measure called \u201cexpected shortfall\u201d or \u201cconditional value at risk,\u201d which is the expected portfolio loss when value at risk has been breached. Conditional value at risk helps estimate the magnitudes of expected loss on the very bad days. Firms such as J.P. Morgan and MSCI Barra are employing the measure.\nSource: Eleanor Laise, The Wall Street Journal, September 8, 2009, \np. C1. Reprinted with permission. \u00a9 2009 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Observe from  Figure\u00a05.4  that the relative frequency \nof negative 3-sigma jumps in a standard normal distribution is only 0.13%, that is, 1.3 observations per 1,000. Thus in a small sample, it is hard to obtain a representative out-come, one that reflects true statistical expectations of extreme events. \n In the analysis of the history of some popular investment vehicles in the next section \nwe will show why practitioners need this plethora of statistics and performance measures to analyze risky investments. The nearby box discusses the growing popularity of these measures, and particularly the new focus on fat tails and extreme events.    \n  We can now apply the analytical tools worked out in previous sections to six interesting \nrisky portfolios. \n Our base portfolio is the broadest possible U.S. equity portfolio, including all stocks \nlisted on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ. We shall denote it as \u201cAll U.S.\u201d Logic sug-gests that an unmanaged (passive) portfolio should invest more in larger firms, and hence the natural benchmark is a value-weighted portfolio. Firm capitalization, or market cap, is highly skewed to the right, with many small but a few gigantic firms. Because it is value weighted, the All U.S. portfolio is dominated by the large-firm corporate sector. \n The data include monthly excess returns on all U.S. stocks from July 1926 to September \n2012, a sample period spanning just over 86 years. We break this period into three subpe-riods, different in length and economic circumstances. We would like to see how portfolio performance varies across the subperiods.    5.8 Historic Returns on Risky Portfolios \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   141bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   141 8/1/13   7:51 AM8/1/13   7:51 AMFinal PDF to printer\n142 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n The early subperiod stretches over the second quarter of the 20th century, July 1926 to \nDecember 1949, and its 282 months span the Great Depression, WWII, and its immediate \naftermath. \n The second subperiod is the second half of the 20th century (January 1950 to December \n1999) and its 600 months cover a relatively stable period, albeit with three wars (Korea, Vietnam, and the first Gulf War) and eight relatively mild recessions and recoveries. It ends with the tech bubble of the late 1990s. \n The third subperiod covers the first 153 months of the 21st century, a difficult period. \nIt includes two deep recessions of different types: one following the bursting of the tech bubble in 2001, and the other following the bursting of the housing-price bubble beginning in 2007; each episode slashed stock values by about 40%. The prolonged Iraq war and the Afghan conflict put further strain on the U.S. economy in these years. \n We also present four portfolios to compare with the benchmark All U.S portfolio. These \ncomparison groups are motivated by empirical evidence that two variables (other than risk) have been associated with stock returns: firm size (measured by market capitalization) and the ratio of firm book value to market value of equity. \n Average realized returns have generally been higher for stocks of small rather than large \ncapitalization firms, other things equal. \u201cOther things\u201d in this context means risk as best as we can measure it. Hence, two of the four portfolios include stocks of firms in the top half of the distribution of market capitalization, while the other two portfolios include firms from the bottom half. \n The accounting value of a firm reported on its balance sheet reflects the historical cost \nof its  past  investments in assets, often dubbed  assets in place  and therefore is a backward-\nlooking measure of value. Book value of equity equals total firm value minus the par value of outstanding debt. In contrast, the  market  value of equity reflects the present value of \n future  cash flows from existing lines of business, expected growth in those businesses, \nas well as cash flows from projects yet to be started, often dubbed  growth opportunities.  \nA good portion of the difference between the book value and market value of equity will depend on the relative proportions of assets in place versus growth opportunities. A low ratio of book-to-market value (B/M) is typical of firms whose market value derives mostly from growth prospects. A high B/M ratio is typical of \u201cvalue\u201d firms, whose market values derive mostly from assets in place. Realized average returns, other things equal, histori-cally have been higher for value firms than for growth firms. \n Eugene Fama and Kenneth French extensively documented the firm size and B/M regu-\nlarities, and these patterns have since been corroborated in stock exchanges around the world.  \n15   The Fama-French database includes returns on portfolios of U.S. stocks sorted \nby size (Big; Small) and by B/M ratios (High; Medium; Low) and rebalances these six portfolios every midyear.  \n16    \n We drop the medium B/M portfolios, identify high B/M firms as \u201cValue firms\u201d and low \nB/M firms as \u201cGrowth firms,\u201d and thus obtain four comparison portfolios as Big/Value; Big/Growth; Small/Value; Small/Growth. While it is common to use value weighting, we will use equally weighted versions of these portfolios in order to give greater emphasis to smaller firms and thus sharpen the contrast with the large-cap heavy All U.S. benchmark. \n  Table\u00a05.3  shows the number of firms, average firm size, and average B/M ratio for each \nportfolio at the outset and end of each subperiod. The number of stocks in the portfolios steadily increases, except during the 21st century, when bad times killed off a large num-ber of small firms. The exit of so many small firms from the sample generally increased the average capitalization of the remaining firms, despite their loss of market value.

The vertical \naxis shows the fraction of returns in each bin. (The dark columns in the histograms are based \non the historical sample while the light columns describe a normal distribution.) The bins \nare 2.5 basis points (.025%) wide for T-bill returns, and 50 basis points wide for the All U.S. \nportfolio. The extreme bins at the far right and left of each histogram are actually the sums \nof the frequencies of all returns beyond the reported range (less than  2 20% or greater than \n20%). Panels C and D show histograms of excess returns on the two \u201cBig\u201d or large-cap port-\nfolios (one for Big/Value stocks and the other for Big/Growth stocks) while panels E and F \nare excess return histograms on the two \u201cSmall\u201d portfolios (Small/Value and Small/Growth).\n A first look at the actual excess returns on stocks verifies that the tails are uniformly fat-\nter than would be observed in a normal distribution, implying higher incidence of extreme \nresults.

Compared to subperiod averages, the 21st century so far has been particularly \nhard on very large firms, as we see from the value-weighted All U.S. portfolio. Not sur-\nprisingly, the second half of the 20th century, politically and economically the most stable \nsubperiod, offered the highest average returns, particularly for the equally-weighted port-\nfolios.  Table\u00a05.4A , which reports a subset of  Table\u00a05.4 , shows these average returns.        \n As we would expect, the second quarter of the 20th century, dominated by the Great \nDepression and legendary for upheaval in stock values, exhibits the highest standard devia-\ntions ( Table\u00a05.4B ).   \n All portfolios attained their highest Sharpe ratios over the second half of the 20th \ncentury ( Table\u00a05.4C ). The 21st century has witnessed the lowest performance from the large \ncap-weighted All U.S. portfolio and a middling performance from the equally weighted \nportfolios. More surprising is the fact that average returns were not particularly low over \nthe second quarter of the 20th century, despite the deep setbacks of the Depression period. \n    All U.S.    Big/\nValue    Big/\nGrowth    Small/\nValue    Small/\nGrowth    Average of Four \nComparison Portfolios  \n All years  7.52  12.34  10.98  26.28  8.38  14.49 \n 21st century  1.82  8.80  14.51  17.89  4.83  11.51 \n 20th cent. 2 nd  half  8.64  16.02  11.49  50.48  12.81  22.70 \n 20th cent. 2 nd  quarter  8.44  11.50  9.83  17.05  7.20  11.40 \n Table 5.4A \n Average excess returns over time \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   147bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   147 6/18/13   8:04 PM6/18/13   8:04 PMFinal PDF to printer\n148 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nHowever, given the considerable imprecision of these estimates (standard errors of around \n0.20 or 20%), we cannot be sure Sharpe ratios are all that different either across subperiods or across portfolios.    \n  Portfolio Returns \n The major objective is to compare the five equity portfolios. We started with the prem-ise that the value-weighted All U.S. portfolio is a natural choice for passive investors. We chose the other four portfolios because empirical evidence suggests that size (big vs. small) and B/M ratios (value vs. growth) are important drivers of performance. \n The average returns in  Table\u00a05.4A  show that the Small/Value portfolio did in fact offer \na higher average return in all periods, and the differences from the averages of the other portfolios are all statistically significant.  \n19   In addition, the average of the returns on the \nequally weighted comparison portfolios (the right-most column in  Table\u00a05.4A ) was signif-icantly higher than that of the All U.S. portfolio. But before deeming these performances superior or inferior, it must be shown that the differences in their average returns cannot be explained by differences in risk. Here, we must question the use of standard deviation as a measure of risk for any particular asset or portfolio. Standard deviation measures overall volatility and hence is a legitimate risk measure only for portfolios that are consid-ered appropriate for an investor\u2019s entire wealth-at-risk, that is, for broad capital allocation. Assets or portfolios that are considered to be  added  to the rest of an investor\u2019s entire-\nwealth portfolio must be judged on the basis of  incremental  risk. This distinction requires \nrisk measures other than standard deviation, and we will return to this issue in great detail in later chapters.\n \n  Table\u00a0 5.4B  shows the large standard deviation involved in these broad-based stock \ninvestments. Annual SD ranges from 15% to as much as 63%. Even using the smallest SD suggests that losing 15% of portfolio value in one year would not be so unusual. Apparently, size is correlated with volatility, as suggested by the higher SD of the two small portfolios, and the lowest volatility of the large-cap All U.S. portfolio. While it appears that value portfolios generally are more volatile than growth portfolios, the difference is not suffi-cient to make us confident of this assertion. \n Regardless of how we resolve the question of performance of these portfolios, we \nmust determine whether SD is an adequate measure of risk in the first place, in view of deviations from normality.  Table\u00a05.4  shows that negative skew is present in some of the portfolios some of the time, and positive kurtosis is present in  all  portfolios  all  the time. \nThis implies that we must carefully evaluate the effect of these deviations on value-at-risk (VaR), expected shortfall (ES), and negative 3-sigma frequencies. Finally, since  Figure\u00a05.6  separates the distributions of monthly excess returns to those within a range of  6 10% and \nthose outside that range, we can quantify the implication of extreme returns. \n We start with the difference between VaR from the actual distribution of returns and the \nequivalent normal distribution (with the same mean and variance). Recall that the 5% VaR is the loss corresponding to the 5th percentile of the rate of return distribution. It is one measure of the risk of extreme outcomes, often called  tail risk  because it focuses on out-\ncomes in the far left tail of the distribution. We compare historical tail risk to that predicted by the normal distribution by comparing actual VaR to the VaR of the equivalent normal distribution. The excess VaR is the VaR of the historical distribution versus the VaR of the corresponding normal, where negative numbers indicate greater losses. \n  Table\u00a05.4D  shows that for the overall period, VaR indicates no greater tail risk than is \ncharacteristic of the equivalent normal. The worst excess VaR compared to the normal \n19The t-statistic of the difference in average return is: Average difference/SD(Difference).\nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   148bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   148 6/18/13   8:04 PM6/18/13   8:04 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 149\n    All U.S.    Big/\nValue    Big/\nGrowth    Small/\nValue    Small/\nGrowth  \n Number of negative jumps  7.7  4.8  9.7  2.9  3.9 \n Expected jumps for equivalent normal  0.9  0.9  0.8  0.6  1.0 \n Difference  5  excess jumps  6.8  4.0  8.9  2.3  2.8 \n Average years between excess jumps  12.24  21.06  9.42  36.23  29.37 \n Expected excess returns between extra \njumps (in units of SD)  16.90  32.91  17.16  104.23  28.98 \n Table 5.4F \n Incidence of negative 3-sigma returns \n    All U.S.    Big/\nValue    Big/\nGrowth    Small/\nValue    Small/\nGrowth    Average of Four \nComparison Portfolios  \n All years  0.12  0.93  0.85  2.81  0.72  1.33 \n 21st century   2 1.02   2 1.71  0.34   2 0.67   2 0.37   2 0.60 \n 20th cent. 2 nd  quarter  0.06   2 0.19  0.19  0.47  0.34  0.20 \n 20th cent. 2 nd  half   2 1.16   2 0.09   2 0.08   2 0.39  0.18   2 0.09 \n Table 5.4D \n VaR (excess over normal distribution) expressed as a fraction of monthly standard deviation \n    All U.S.    Big/\nValue    Big/\nGrowth    Small/\nValue    Small/\nGrowth    Average of Four \nComparison Portfolios  \n All years   2 0.41   2 0.33   2 0.34   2 0.08   2 0.25   2 0.25 \n 21st century   2 0.28   2 0.47   2 0.17   2 0.19   2 0.11   2 0.24 \n 20th cent. 2 nd  quarter   2 0.18   2 0.06   2 0.13   2 0.07   2 0.18   2 0.11 \n 20th cent. 2 nd  half   2 0.77   2 0.59   2 0.77   2 0.37   2 0.26   2 0.50 \n Table 5.4E \n Expected shortfall (excess over normal distribution) expressed as a fraction of monthly standard deviation \n( 2 1.71% for the Big/Value portfolio in the 21st century) is less than a third of the monthly \nSD of this portfolio, 6.01%. Hence, VaR figures indicate that the normal is a decent \napproximation to the actual return distribution.   \n However, other measures indicate that tail risk may be somewhat greater than in the \nnormal distribution. The expected shortfall (ES) figures in  Table\u00a05.4  are more negative \nfor the actual than for the equivalent normal excess returns (consistent with the fat tails \nindicated by the positive kurtosis). To assess the economic significance of the differ-\nences from normal, we present them in  Table\u00a05.4E  as fractions of the monthly SDs of \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   149bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   149 6/18/13   8:04 PM6/18/13   8:04 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 5 0 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nthe various portfolios. The negative signs tell us that while the most negative 5% of the \nactual observations are always worse than the equivalent normal, the differences are not \nsubstantial: The magnitudes are never larger than 0.77 of the portfolio SD. Measured over \nthe entire period, the excess shortfall does not exceed 0.41 of the monthly standard devia-\ntion. Here, again, we don\u2019t see evidence that seriously undermines the adequacy of the \nnormality assumption.   \n  Table\u00a05.4F  shows the actual number of negative monthly returns or \u201cjumps\u201d of magni-\ntude greater than 3 standard deviations, compared with the expected number correspond-\ning to the equivalent normal distributions. The actual numbers range from 2.9 to 9.7 per \n1,000 months, compared with only 0.6 to 1.0 for equivalent normal distributions. What are \nwe to make of this? Negative 3-sigma returns are very bad surprises indeed. To help inter-\npret these differences, we compute the expected length of time (number of years) between \n\u201cextra jumps,\u201d i.e., jumps beyond the expected number based on the normal distribution. \nWe also calculate the expected total return over this period, also in units of standard devia-\ntion of the actual distribution. \n  Table\u00a0 5.4F  shows the results of these calculations. We see that one excess jump is \nobserved every 9 to 36 years, and that over such periods, the portfolios are expected to \nyield excess returns of 16 to 104 standard deviations compared with the loss of 3 SD or \nmore due to these jumps. Thus, jump risk does not appear large enough to affect the risk \nand return of long-term stock returns.   \n Finally, we interpret the  size  of the jumps outside the range of  6 10% that appear so \nominous in  Figure\u00a05.6 . To quantify this risk, we ask: \u201cWhen we look at all excess returns \nbelow  2 10% in our history of 1,035 months, what is the SD of all these (extremely bad) \nreturns?\u201d And a follow-up question: \u201cWhat would be the tail SD of a normal return with \nthe same mean and overall SD as our sample, conditional on return falling below  2 10%?\u201d \n Table\u00a05.4G  answers these two questions. It is evident that the actual history suggests a \nlarger SD than a normal distribution would imply, consistent with  Figure\u00a05.6 . The differ-\nence can be as large as 43% of the SD of the equivalent normal in the extreme negative \nrange. Of all the statistics we have examined so far, this is the most damning for a straight-\nforward approximation of actual distributions by the normal.   \n We can conclude from all this that a simple normal distribution is generally not a bad \napproximation of portfolio returns, despite the fact that in some circumstances it may \nunderstate investment risk. However, we can make up for this pitfall by more careful esti-\nmation of the SD of extreme returns. Nevertheless, we should be cautious about application \nof theories and inferences that require normality of returns. In general, one should verify \nthat standard deviations assumed for assets or portfolios adequately represent tail risk. \n In the next chapters we will return to these portfolios and ask whether the All U.S. \nportfolio is the most efficient in terms of its risk-return trade-off.

It is comforting that the assumption of approximately nor-\nmal distributions of asset returns, which makes this investigation tractable, is also rea-\nsonably accurate. \n  A Global View of the Historical Record \n As financial markets around the world grow and become more transparent, U.S. investors \nlook to improve diversification by investing internationally. Foreign investors that tradi-\ntionally used U.S. financial markets as a safe haven to supplement home-country invest-\nments also seek international diversification to reduce risk. The question arises as to how \nhistorical U.S. experience compares with that of stock markets around the world. \n  Figure\u00a0 5.7  shows a century-long history (1900\u20132000) of average nominal and real \nreturns in stock markets of 16 developed countries. We find the United States in fourth \nplace in terms of average real returns, behind Sweden, Australia, and South Africa. \n Figure\u00a05.8  shows the standard deviations of real stock and bond returns for these same \ncountries. We find the United States tied with four other countries for third place in terms \nof lowest standard deviation of real stock returns. So the United States has done well, but \nnot abnormally so, compared with these countries.   \n One interesting feature of these figures is that the countries with the worst results, \nmeasured by the ratio of average real returns to standard deviation, are Italy, Belgium, \nGermany, and Japan\u2014the countries most devastated by World War II. The top-performing \ncountries are Australia, Canada, and the United States, the countries least devastated by \nthe wars of the 20th century. Another, perhaps more telling feature is the insignificant \ndifference between the real returns in the different countries. The difference between the \nhighest average real rate (Sweden, at 7.6%) and the average return across the 16 countries \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   151bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   151 6/18/13   8:04 PM6/18/13   8:04 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 5 2 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n(5.1%) is 2.5%. Similarly, the difference between the average and the lowest country return \n(Belgium, at 2.5%) is 2.6%.

We conclude that the U.S. \nexperience cannot be dismissed as an outlier. Hence, using the U.S. stock market as a yard-\nstick for return characteristics may be reasonable. \n These days, practitioners and scholars are debating whether the historical U.S. average \nrisk-premium of large stocks over T-bills of 7.52% ( Table\u00a05.4 ) is a reasonable forecast \nfor the long term. This debate centers around two questions: First, do economic factors \nthat prevailed over that historic period (1926\u20132012) adequately represent those that may \nprevail over the forecasting horizon? Second, is the arithmetic average from the available \nhistory a good yardstick for long-term forecasts?    \n Figure 5.8 Standard deviations of real equity and bond returns around the world, 1900\u20132000   \nSource: Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton,  Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Returns   \n(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002), p. 61.

We see that \na monthly risk premium of just .5% produces a retirement fund that is more than four times that of the risk-free alternative. Such is the power of compounding. Why, then, would any-one invest in Treasuries? Obviously, this is an issue of trading excess return for risk. What is the nature of this return-to-risk trade-off? The risk of an investment that compounds at fluctuating rates over the long run is important, but is widely misunderstood. \n We can construct the probability distribution of the stock-fund terminal value from \na binomial tree just as we did earlier for the newspaper stand, except that instead of  adding  monthly profits, the portfolio value  compounds  monthly by a rate drawn from \na given distribution. For example, suppose we can approximate the portfolio monthly \ndistribution as follows: Each month the rate of return is either 5.54% or  2 3.54%, \nwith equal probabilities of .5. This configuration generates an expected return of 1% per month. The portfolio volatility is measured as the monthly standard deviation: \n   \".53(5.54 21)\n21.53(23.54 21)254.54%.   After 2 months, the event tree looks \nlike this:     \nPortfolio value = $1 \u00d7 1.0554 \u00d7 1.0554 = $1.1139\nPortfolio value = $1 \u00d7 1.0554 \u00d7 .9646 = $1.0180\nPortfolio value = $1 \u00d7 .9646 \u00d7 .9646 = $.9305\n \u201cGrowing\u201d the tree for 300 months will result in 301 different possible outcomes. The \nprobability of each outcome can be obtained from Excel\u2019s BINOMDIST function. From \nthe 301 possible outcomes and associated probabilities we compute the mean ($19.79) and the standard deviation ($18.09) of the terminal value. Can we use this standard deviation as a measure of risk to be weighed against the risk premium of 19.79\u00a0 2 \u00a04.29\u00a0 5 \u00a015.5\u00a0(1,550%)? \nRecalling the effect of asymmetry on the validity of standard deviation as a measure of risk, we must first view the shape of the probability distribution at the end of the tree. \n  Figure\u00a05.9  plots the probability of possible outcomes against the terminal value. The \nasymmetry of the distribution is striking. The highly positive skewness suggests the stan-dard deviation of terminal value will not be useful in this case. Indeed, the binomial dis-tribution, when period returns compound, converges to a    lognormal,    rather than a normal, \n   distribution.    The lognormal describes the distribution of a variable whose  logarithm  is \nnormally distributed.   \n   Normal and Lognormal Returns \n As we mentioned earlier, one of the important properties of the normal distribution is its \nstability, in the sense that adding up normally distributed returns results in a return that also is normally distributed. But this property does not extend to  multiplying  normally \ndistributed returns; yet this is what we need to do to find returns over longer horizons. For example, even if two returns,  r  \n1  and  r  2 , are normal, the two-period return will compound \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   153bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   153 6/18/13   8:04 PM6/18/13   8:04 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 5 4 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n Figure 5.9 Probability of investment outcomes after 25 years with \na lognormal distribution (approximated from a binomial tree)  \n0.005.01.015.02.025.03.035.04.045.05\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200Probability of Outcome\nInvestment Outcome (truncated at $200)Tail = $0.00002Tail = $10,595,634to (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  1 )(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  2 )\u00a0 2 \u00a01, which is  not\nnormally distributed. Perhaps the \nnormal distribution does not qualify \nas the simplifying distribution we \npurported it to be. But the lognor-\nmal distribution does! What is this \ndistribution? \n Technically, a random variable  X\nis lognormal if its logarithm, ln( X ), \nis normally distributed. It turns \nout that if stock prices are \u201cinstan-\ntaneously\u201d normal (i.e., returns \nover the shortest time intervals are \nnormally distributed) then their \n longer-term compounded returns and \nthe future stock price will be log-\nnormal.  20   Conversely, if stock prices \nare distributed lognormally, then \nthe continuously compounded rate \nof return will be normally distrib-\nuted. Thus, if we work with continuously compounded (CC) returns rather than effec-\ntive per period rates of return, we can preserve the simplification provided by the \nnormal distribution, since those CC returns will be normal regardless of the invest-\nment horizon.   \n Recall that the continuously compounded rate is  r   CC  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 ln(1\u00a0  1 \u00a0 r ), so if we observe \neffective rates of return, we can use this formula to compute the CC rate. With  r   CC   nor-\nmally distributed, we can do all our analyses and calculations using the normally distrib-\nuted CC rates. If needed, we can always recover the effective rate,  r , from the CC rate \nfrom:    r5erCC21.  \n Let\u2019s see what the rules are when a stock price is lognormally distributed. Suppose the \nlog of the stock price is normally distributed with an expected annual growth rate of  g\nand a SD of  s . When a normal rate compounds by random shocks from instant to instant, \nthe fluctuations do not produce symmetric effects on price. A positive uptick raises the \nbase, so the next tick is expected to be larger than the previous one. The reverse is true \nafter a downtick; the base is smaller and the next tick is expected to be smaller. As a \nresult, a sequence of positive shocks will have a larger upward effect than the downward \neffect of a sequence of negative shocks. Thus, an upward drift is created just by volatil-\nity, even if  g  is zero. How big is this extra drift? It depends on the amplitude of the ticks; \nin fact, it amounts to half their variance. Therefore  m,  the expected continuously com-\npounded expected rate of return, is larger than  g.  The rule for the expected CC annual \nrate becomes,   \n E(rCC)5m5g1  \u00bd  s2   (5.21)   \n20 We see a similar phenomenon in the binomial tree example depicted in  Figure\u00a0 5.9 . Even with many bad \nreturns, stock prices cannot become negative, so the distribution is bounded at zero. But many good returns can \nincrease stock prices without limit, so the compound return after many periods has a long right tail, but a left tail \nbounded by a worst-case cumulative return of  2 100%. This gives rise to the asymmetric skewed shape that is \ncharacteristic of the log-normal distribution. \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   154bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   154 6/18/13   8:04 PM6/18/13   8:04 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 155\n With a normally distributed CC rate, we expect that some initial wealth of $ W  0  will com-\npound over one year to    W0eg1\u00bd s25Wem,  and hence the expected effective rate of return is   \n E(r)5eg1\u00bd s2215em21  (5.22)   \n If an annual CC rate applies to an investment over any period  T,  either longer or shorter \nthan one year, the investment will grow by the proportion    r(T)5erCCT21.  The expected \ncumulative return,  r   CC   T , is proportional to  T , that is,    E(rCCT)5mT5gT1\u00bd s2T  and \nexpected final wealth is   \n E(WT)5W0 emT5W0e(g1\u00bd s2)T  (5.23)   \n The variance of the cumulative return is also proportional to the time horizon: \nVar( r   CC   T )\u00a0 5 \u00a0 T Var( r   CC  ),  21   but standard deviation rises only in proportion to the square root \nof time:    s(rCCT)5\"TVar(rCC)5s\"T.   \n This  appears  to offer a mitigation of investment risk in the long run: Because \nthe expected return increases with horizon at a faster rate than the standard deviation, the \nexpected return of a long-term risky investment becomes ever larger relative to its standard deviation. Perhaps shortfall risk declines as investment horizon increases. We look at this possibility in Example 5.11. \n \n  21 The variance of the effective annual rate when returns are lognormally distributed is: Var( r )\u00a0 5 \u00a0 e  2 m  (      es2\u00a0 2 \u00a01). \n   22 In some versions of Excel, the function is NORM.S.DIST(z, TRUE).  An expected effective monthly rate of return of 1% is equivalent to a CC rate of \nln(1.01)\u00a0 5 \u00a00.00995 (0.995% per month). The risk-free rate is assumed to be 0.5% per \nmonth, equivalent to a CC rate of ln(1.005)\u00a0 5 \u00a00.4988%. The effective SD of 4.54% \nimplies (see footnote   21  ) a monthly SD of the CC rate of 4.4928%. Hence the monthly \nCC risk premium is 0.995\u00a0 2 \u00a00.4988\u00a0 5 \u00a00.4963%, with a SD of 4.4928%, and a Sharpe \nratio of .4963/4.4928\u00a0 5 \u00a00.11. In other words, returns would have to be .11 standard \ndeviations below the mean before the stock portfolio underperformed T-bills. Using the normal distribution, we see that the probability of a rate of return shortfall relative to the risk-free rate is 45.6%. (You can confirm this by entering  2 .11 in Excel\u2019s NORMSDIST \nfunction.  \n22  ) This is the probability of investor \u201cregret,\u201d that after the fact, the investor \nwould have been better off in T-bills than investing in the stock portfolio. \n For a 300-month horizon, however, the expected value of the cumulative excess \nreturn is .4963%\u00a0 3 \u00a0300\u00a0 5 \u00a0148.9% and the standard deviation is    4.4928\" 300 577.82,  \nimplying a whopping Sharpe ratio of 1.91. Enter  2 1.91 in Excel\u2019s NORMSDIST function, \nand you will see that the probability of shortfall over a 300-month horizon is only .029.

We show in later chap-\nters how the fair market price of portfolio insurance can be estimated from option-pricing \nmodels. \n Despite the low probability that a portfolio insurance policy would have to pay up (only \n2.9% for the 25-year policy), the magnitude and timing  23   of possible losses would make \nsuch long-term insurance surprisingly costly. For example, standard option-pricing models \nsuggest that the value of insurance against shortfall risk over a 10-year horizon would cost \nnearly 20% of the initial value of the portfolio. And contrary to any intuition that a longer \nhorizon reduces shortfall risk, the value of portfolio insurance increases dramatically with \nthe maturity of the contract. For example, a 25-year policy would be about 50% more \ncostly, or about 30% of the initial portfolio value.   \n23 By \u201ctiming,\u201d we mean that a decline in stock prices is associated with a bad economy when extra income would \nbe most important to an investor. The fact that the insurance policy would pay off in these scenarios contributes \nto its market value. \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   156bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   156 6/18/13   8:04 PM6/18/13   8:04 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 157\n  Simulation of Long-Term Future Rates of Return \n The frequency distributions in  Figure\u00a05.6  provide only rough descriptions of the nature of \nthe return distributions and are even harder to interpret for long-term investments. One way \nto learn from history about the distribution of long-term future returns is to simulate these \nfuture returns from that history. The method to accomplish this task is called  bootstrapping.   \n Bootstrapping is a procedure that avoids any assumptions about the return distribution, \nexcept that all rates of return in the sample history are equally likely. For example, we \ncould simulate 25 years of possible future returns by sampling (with replacement) 25 ran-\ndomly selected annual returns from our available history. We compound those 25 returns \nto obtain one possible 25-year holding-period return. This procedure is repeated thousands \nof times to generate a probability distribution of long-term total returns that is anchored in \nthe historical frequency distribution. \n The cardinal decision when embarking on a bootstrapping exercise is the choice of \nhow far into the past we should go to draw observations for \u201cfuture\u201d return sequences.

The black swan is a symbol of tail risk\u2014highly unlikely but extreme and important outcomes that are all but impossible to predict from experience. The implication for bootstrapping is that limiting possible future returns to the range of past returns, or extreme returns to their historical frequency, may easily underes-timate actual exposure to tail risk. Notice that when simulating from a normal distribution, we do allow for unbounded bad outcomes, although without allowing for fat tails, we may greatly underestimate their probabilities. However, using  any  particular probability dis-\ntribution predetermines the shape of future events based on measurements from the past.\n  \n The dilemma of how to describe uncertainty largely comes down to how investors \nshould respond to the possibility of low-probability disasters. Those who argue that an investment is less risky in the long run implicitly downplay extreme events. The high price of portfolio insurance provides proof positive that a majority of investors certainly do not ignore them. As far as the present exercise is concerned, we show that even a simulation based on generally benign past U.S. history will produce cases of investor ruin. \n An important objective of this exercise is to assess the potential effect of deviations \nfrom normality on the probability distribution of a long-term investment in U.S. stocks. For this purpose, we bootstrap 50,000 25-year simulated \u201chistories\u201d for large and small stocks, and produce for each history the average annual return. We contrast these samples to simi-lar samples drawn from normal distributions that (due to compounding) result in lognor-mally distributed long-term total returns. Results are shown in  Figure\u00a05.10 . Panel A shows frequency distributions of large U.S. stocks, constructed by sampling both from actual returns and from the normal distribution. Panel B shows the same frequency distributions for small U.S. stocks. The boxes inside  Figure\u00a05.10  show the statistics of the distributions. \n We first review the results for large stocks in panel A. We see that the difference in \nfrequency distributions between the simulated history and the normal curve is small but distinct. Despite the very small differences between the averages of 1-year and 25-year annual returns, as well as between the standard deviations, the small differences in skewness and kurtosis combine to produce significant differences in the probabilities of shortfalls and losses, as well as in the potential terminal loss. For small stocks, shown in panel B, the smaller differences in skewness and kurtosis lead to almost identical figures for the probability and magnitude of losses. \n We should also consider the risk of long-term investments. The probability of ruin is \nminiscule, and indeed, as the following table indicates, the probability of  any  loss is less \nthan 1% for large stocks and 5% for small stocks. This is in line with our calculations in Example 5.11 showing that shortfall probabilities fall as the investment horizon extends. But look at the top line of the table, showing the potential  size  of your loss in the (admit-\ntedly unlikely) worst-case scenarios. Risk depends on both the probability and the size of the potential loss, and here that worst-case scenario is very bad indeed.   \n    Statistic    Actual    Normal Distribution  \n  Large Stocks    Small Stocks    Large Stocks    Small Stocks  \n Maximum terminal loss (%)  95  99  82  98 \n Probability of loss  .0095  .0415  .0064  .0428 \n Probability of shortfall  .1044  .1178  .0603  .1232 \n  24  The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,  New York, Random House, 2010. \nbod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   158bod61671_ch05_117-167.indd   158 6/18/13   8:04 PM6/18/13   8:04 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record 159\n What about risk for investors with \nother long-term horizons?  Figure\u00a05.11  \ncompares 25-year to 10-year invest-\nments in large and small stocks. For \nan appropriate comparison we must \nsupplement the 10-year investment \nwith a 15-year investment in T-bills. \nTo accomplish this comparison, we \nbootstrap 15-year samples from the \nhistory of T-bill rates and augment \neach sample with 10 annual rates \ndrawn from the history of the risky \ninvestment. Panels A1 and A2 in \n Figure\u00a05.11  show the comparison for \nlarge stocks. The frequency distribu-\ntions reveal a substantial difference in \nthe risks of the terminal portfolio. This \ndifference is clearly manifested in the \nportfolio performance statistics. The \nsame picture arises in panels B1 and \nB2 for small stocks. Notice that even \na 10-year investment in small stocks \ncould lead to a terminal loss of 94%.  \n  Figure\u00a0 5.12  shows trajectories of \nwealth indexes for some of the pos-\nsible outcomes of a 25-year invest-\nment in large stocks, compared with the wealth index of the average outcome of a T-bill \nportfolio. The outcomes of the stock portfolio in  Figure\u00a05.12  range from the worst, through \nthe bottom 1% and 5% of terminal value, and up to the mean and median terminal values. \nThe bottom 5% still results in a significant shortfall relative to the T-bill portfolio. In sum, \nthe analysis clearly rejects the notion that stocks become less risky in the long run.  \n Yet many practitioners hold on to the view that investment risk is less pertinent to long-\nterm investors. A typical demonstration shown in the nearby box relies on the fact that the \nstandard deviation (or range of likely outcomes) of  annualized   returns is lower for longer-\nterm horizons. But the demonstration is silent on the range of  total  returns.   \n  The Risk-Free Rate Revisited \n At the outset of this chapter we put forward a simple view of the real and nominal risk-\nfree rate, where we were not very explicit about investment horizon. But as a general \nrule, the maturity of the risk-free rate should match the investment horizon. Investors \nwith long maturities will view the rate on long-term safe bonds as providing their bench-\nmark risk-free rate. Interest rates generally vary with maturity and, surely, inflation is \nmore difficult to predict over longer horizons. Thus inflation risk becomes more potent \nwith maturity. \n It is important to realize that the risk premium on risky assets is a  real  quantity. The \nexpected rate on a risky asset equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. That risk pre-\nmium is incremental to the risk-free rate and makes for the same  incremental   addition, \nwhether we state the risk-free rate in real or nominal terms. \n An investor views the  real  rate for each maturity as the benchmark for investments of \nthat maturity, and hence a real risky rate should be displayed as a real risk-free rate plus \n Figure 5.12 Wealth indexes of selected outcomes of large stock \nportfolios and the average T-bill portfolio.

Even default-free nominal rates on long-maturity Treasury bonds may \nembody a risk premium due to uncertainty about future inflation and interest rates. \n Enter TIPS, the Treasury bond that promises investors an inflation-indexed real rate for \na desired maturity. Now we can think of the expected real rate on a risky investment of a given maturity as the rate on the same-maturity TIPS bond plus a risk premium. \n The existence of both nominal Treasuries and TIPS also has informational value. The \ndifference in the expected rates on these bonds is called the  forward  rate of inflation, which \nincludes both the  expected  rate and the appropriate risk premium. \n Why then do we see excess returns usually stated relative to one-month T-bill rates? \nThis is because most discussions refer to short-term investments. To seriously consider a long-term investment, however, we must account for the relevant real, risk-free rate.  \n  Where Is Research on Rates of Return Headed? \n In order to learn more about the distribution of returns, particularly the behavior of rela-tively rare extreme events, we need a lot more data. The speed with which we accumulate even daily rates of return will not get us there; by the time we have a large enough sample, the distributions may well have changed. But it may be that help is on the way. \n The highest frequency we can obtain for rates of return comes from trade-by-trade data. \nStatistical methods recently developed by astrophysicists can glean from these observa-tions the essential components of the return distributions. The return process can usefully be described as a sum of an instantaneous normal that develops into a lognormal compound  Time vs. Risk \n  MANY BEGINNING INVESTORS  eye the stock market with \na bit of suspicion. They view equity investing as an anx-\nious game of Russian roulette: The longer they stay in, the greater their chance of experiencing more losses. In fact, history shows that the opposite is true. The easiest way to reduce the risk of investing in equities\u2014and improve the gain\u2014is to increase the time you hang on to your portfolio. \n See for yourself. The demonstration below uses histori-\ncal data from 1950 through 2005 to compare investment \nreturns over different lengths of time for small-cap stocks, large caps, long-term bonds, and T-bills. \n  \nSource: CRSP, Federal ReserveTime vs. Risk\n125%\n100%75%50%\n25%\n0%\n\u221225%\n\u221250%\u221275%\nBondsT\u2013bills Large\ncapSmall\ncap\n1\u2013year periods\nBest\nAverage\nWorstzoom in\nadjust for in\ufb02ationRange of annualized returns\nover 1\u2013year periods, The graph starts out showing results for investments \nheld over one-year periods. There\u2019s no doubt about it: Over \nsuch short intervals, small-cap stocks are definitely the risk-iest bet. \n But what about investing for more than a year? If you \nmove the slider at the bottom right of the graph, you can \nsee the range of returns for longer time periods. Even investing for two years instead of one cuts your risk sig-nificantly. As the length of time increases, the volatility of equities decreases sharply\u2014so much so that you may need to click the \u201czoom in\u201d button to get a closer view. Over 10-year periods, government bonds look safer than large-cap equities on the downside. Click the \u201cadjust for infla-tion\u201d box, however, and you\u2019ll see that bond \u201csafety\u201d can be illusory. Inflation has an uncanny ability to erode the value of securities that don\u2019t grow fast enough. \n Now move the slider all the way to the right to see \nthe results of investing for 20-year intervals. Adjusting \nfor inflation, the best 20-year gain a portfolio of long-term Treasury bonds could muster is much lower than that achieved by small- and large-cap stocks. And contrary to popular belief, over their worst 20-year period, long-term bonds actually  lost  money when adjusted for infla-\ntion. Meanwhile, small-cap investors still had gains over a 20-year-period, even when stocks were at their worst. \n Source: Abridged from \u201dTime vs. Risk,\u201d SmartMoney.com, July 31, \n2010. \u00a9 2013 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The jump process itself can be \ndecomposed to an aggregation of small jumps plus large jumps that dominate the tails of the distributions.  \n25    \n We expect that before long practitioners will be able to purchase output of such research \nand obtain accurate risk parameters of a large array of investments. These will add rel-evance to the insights and investment practices described in future chapters.  \n  Forecasts for the Long Haul \n We use arithmetic averages to forecast future rates of return because they are unbiased estimates of expected rates over equivalent holding periods. But the arithmetic average of short-term returns can be misleading when used to forecast long-term cumulative returns. This is because sampling errors in the estimate of expected return will have asymmetric impact when compounded over long periods. Positive sampling variation will compound to greater upward errors than negative variation. \n Jacquier, Kane, and Marcus show that an unbiased forecast of total return over long \nhorizons requires compounding at a weighted average of the arithmetic and geometric historical averages.  \n26   The proper weight applied to the geometric average equals the ratio \nof the length of the forecast horizon to the length of the estimation period. For example, if we wish to forecast the cumulative return for a 25-year horizon from an 80-year history, an unbiased estimate would be to compound at a rate of   \nGeometric average 325\n801Arithmetic average 3(80225)\n80    \n This correction would take about .6% off the historical arithmetic average risk premium on large stocks and about 2% off the arithmetic average premium of small stocks. A forecast for the next 80 years would require compounding at only the geometric average, and for longer horizons at an even lower number. The forecast horizons that are relevant for cur-rent investors would depend on their life expectancies.     \n  25 For an introduction to this approach, see Yacine A\u00eft-Sahalia and Jean Jacod, \u201cAnalyzing the Spectrum of Asset \nReturns: Jump and V olatility Components in High Frequency Data,\u201d  Journal of Economic Literature  50 (2012), \npp. 1007\u201350. \n  26 Eric Jacquier, Alex Kane, and Alan J.

The economy\u2019s equilibrium level of real interest rates depends on the willingness of households \nto save, as reflected in the supply curve of funds, and on the expected profitability of business investment in plant, equipment, and inventories, as reflected in the demand curve for funds. It depends also on government fiscal and monetary policy.  \n    2 .   The nominal rate of interest is the equilibrium real rate plus the expected rate of inflation. In gen-eral, we can directly observe only nominal interest rates; from them, we must infer expected real rates, using inflation forecasts.  \n    3 .

The basis of the argument that stocks are safe in the long run is the fact that the probability of a shortfall becomes smaller. However, probability of shortfall is a poor measure of the safety of an investment. It ignores the magnitude of possible losses.  \n    8 .   Historical returns on stocks exhibit more frequent large negative deviations from the mean than would be predicted from a normal distribution. The lower partial standard deviation (LPSD), the skew, and kurtosis of the actual distribution quantify the deviation from nor-mality. The LPSD, instead of the standard deviation, is sometimes used by practitioners as a measure of risk.  \n    9 .   Widely used measures of tail risk are value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall or, equivalently, conditional tail expectations. VaR measures the loss that will be exceeded with a specified prob-ability such as 5%. The VaR does not add new information when returns are normally distrib-uted. When negative deviations from the average are larger and more frequent than the normal distribution, the 5% VaR will be more than 1.65 standard deviations below the average return. Expected shortfall (ES) measures the expected rate of return conditional on the portfolio falling below a certain value. Thus, 1% ES is the expected return of all possible outcomes in the bottom 1% of the distribution.

You\u2019ve just stumbled on a new dataset that enables you to compute historical rates of return on \nU.S. stocks all the way back to 1880.

You are considering two alternative 2-year investments: You can invest in a risky asset with a \npositive risk premium and returns in each of the 2 years that will be identically distributed and uncorrelated, or you can invest in the risky asset for only 1 year and then invest the proceeds in a risk-free asset. Which of the following statements about the first investment alternative (com-pared with the second) are true?\n     a.  Its 2-year risk premium is the same as the second alternative.  \n    b.  The standard deviation of its 2-year return is the same.  \n    c.  Its annualized standard deviation is lower.      d.  Its Sharpe ratio is higher.      e.

The second step is called  capital \nallocation to risky assets.  \n Clearly, to decide on your capital  allocation \nyou need to know the risky portfolio and evalu-\nate its properties. Can the construction of that risky portfolio be delegated to an expert? An affirmative answer is necessary for a viable  investments management industry. A negative \nanswer would require every investor to learn and implement portfolio management for himself. \n To understand the existence of a portfolio \nmanagement industry in the face of personal investor preferences, we need insight into the \nnature of risk aversion. We characterize a per-sonal utility function that provides a score for the attractiveness of candidate overall portfo-lios on the basis of expected return and risk. By choosing the portfolio with the highest score, investors maximize their satisfaction with their choice of investments; that is, they achieve the optimal allocation of capital to risky assets. \n The utility model also reveals the appropri-\nate objective function for the construction of \nan optimal  risky  portfolio and thus explains \nhow an industry can serve investors with highly diverse preferences without the need to know each of them personally.       CHAPTER SIX \n Capital Allocation \nto Risky Assets  PART II     6.1 Risk and Risk Aversion \n  In Chapter 5 we introduced the concepts of the holding-period return (HPR) and the excess \nrate of return over the risk-free rate. We also discussed estimation of the    risk premium  \n(the  expected  excess return) and the standard deviation of the excess return, which we use \nas the measure of portfolio risk. We demonstrated these concepts with a scenario analysis of a specific risky portfolio (Spreadsheet 5.1). To emphasize that bearing risk typically must be accompanied by a reward in the form of a risk premium, we first differentiate between speculation and gambling.  \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   168bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   168 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 6 Capital Allocation to Risky Assets  169\n   Risk, Speculation, and Gambling \n One definition of  speculation  is \u201cthe assumption of considerable investment risk to obtain \ncommensurate gain.\u201d However, this definition is useless without specifying what is meant \nby \u201cconsiderable risk\u201d and \u201ccommensurate gain.\u201d \n By \u201cconsiderable risk\u201d we mean that the risk is sufficient to affect the decision. An indi-\nvidual might reject an investment that has a positive risk premium because the potential gain is insufficient to make up for the risk involved. By \u201ccommensurate gain\u201d we mean a positive risk premium, that is, an expected profit greater than the risk-free alternative. \n To gamble is \u201cto bet or wager on an uncertain outcome.\u201d The central difference between \ngambling and speculation is the lack of \u201ccommensurate gain.\u201d Economically speaking, a gamble is the assumption of risk for enjoyment of the risk itself, whereas speculation is undertaken  in spite  of the risk involved because one perceives a favorable risk\u2013return \ntrade-off. To turn a gamble into a speculative venture requires an adequate risk premium to compensate risk-averse investors for the risks they bear. Hence,  risk aversion and specula-\ntion are consistent.  Notice that a risky investment with a risk premium of zero, sometimes called a    fair game    ,  amounts to a gamble. A risk-averse investor will reject it. \n In some cases a gamble may  appear  to be speculation. Suppose two investors disagree \nsharply about the future exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the British pound. They may choose to bet on the outcome: Paul will pay Mary $100 if the value of \u00a31 exceeds $1.60 one year from now, whereas Mary will pay Paul if the pound is worth less than $1.60. There are only two relevant outcomes: (1) the pound will exceed $1.60, or (2) it will fall below $1.60. If both Paul and Mary agree on the probabilities of the two possible outcomes, and if neither party anticipates a loss, it must be that they assign  p \u00a05\u00a0.5 to each \noutcome. In that case the expected profit to both is zero and each has entered one side of a gambling prospect. \n What is more likely, however, is that Paul and Mary assign different probabilities to \nthe outcome. Mary assigns it  p \u00a0.\u00a0.5, whereas Paul\u2019s assessment is  p \u00a0,\u00a0.5. They perceive, \nsubjectively, two different prospects. Economists call this case of differing beliefs \u201chet-erogeneous expectations.\u201d In such cases investors on each side of a financial position see themselves as speculating rather than gambling. \n Both Paul and Mary should be asking, Why is the other willing to invest in the side of \na risky prospect that I believe offers a negative expected profit? The ideal way to resolve heterogeneous beliefs is for Paul and Mary to \u201cmerge their information,\u201d that is, for each party to verify that he or she possesses all relevant information and processes the informa-tion properly. Of course, the acquisition of information and the extensive communication that is required to eliminate all heterogeneity in expectations is costly, and thus up to a point heterogeneous expectations cannot be taken as irrational. If, however, Paul and Mary enter such contracts frequently, they would recognize the information problem in one of two ways: Either they will realize that they are creating gambles when each wins half of the bets, or the consistent loser will admit that he or she has been betting on the basis of inferior forecasts. \n  \n Assume that dollar-denominated T-bills in the United States and pound-denominated bills in the United \nKingdom offer equal yields to maturity. Both are short-term assets, and both are free of default risk. Neither offers investors a risk premium.

This implies \nthat most investors are risk averse. \n Investors who are    risk averse    reject investment portfolios that are fair games or worse. \nRisk-averse investors consider only risk-free or speculative prospects with positive risk \npremiums. Loosely speaking, a risk-averse investor \u201cpenalizes\u201d the expected rate of return \nof a risky portfolio by a certain percentage (or penalizes the expected profit by a dollar \namount) to account for the risk involved. The greater the risk, the larger the penalty. We \nbelieve that most investors would accept this view from simple introspection, but we dis-\ncuss the question more fully in Appendixes A through C of this chapter. \n To illustrate the issues we confront when choosing among portfolios with  varying \ndegrees of risk, suppose the risk-free rate is 5% and that an investor considers three \n alternative risky portfolios as shown in  Table\u00a06.1 . The risk premiums and degrees of risk \n(standard deviation, SD) represent the properties of low-risk bonds ( L ), high-risk bonds \n( M ), and large stocks ( H ). Accordingly, these portfolios offer progressively higher risk \n premiums to compensate for greater risk. How might investors choose among them?  \n Intuitively, a portfolio is more attractive when its expected return is higher and its risk \nis lower. But when risk increases along with return, the most attractive portfolio is not \nobvious. How can investors quantify the rate at which they are willing to trade off return \nagainst risk? \n We will assume that each investor can assign a welfare, or    utility    ,  score to competing \nportfolios on the basis of the expected return and risk of those portfolios. Higher  utility \nvalues are assigned to portfolios with more attractive risk\u2013return profiles. Portfolios \nreceive higher utility scores for higher expected returns and lower scores for higher \n volatility. Many particular \u201cscoring\u201d systems are legitimate. One reasonable  function that \nhas been employed by both financial theorists and the CFA Institute assigns a  portfolio \nwith expected return  E ( r ) and variance of returns  s  2  the following utility score:   \nU 5 E(r) 2 \u00bdA s  2   (6.1)   \n where  U  is the utility value and  A  is an index of the investor\u2019s risk aversion. The factor of \n\u00bd is just a scaling convention. To use Equation 6.1, rates of return must be expressed as \ndecimals rather than percentages. Notice that the portfolio in question here is the all-wealth \ninvestment. Hence, assuming normality, standard deviation is the appropriate  measure \nof risk. \n Equation 6.1 is consistent with the notion that utility is enhanced by high expected \nreturns and diminished by high risk. Notice that risk-free portfolios receive a utility \nscore equal to their (known) rate of return, because they receive no penalty for risk. \nThe extent to which the variance of risky portfolios lowers utility depends on  A,  the \n  Portfolio    Risk Premium    Expected Return    Risk (SD)  \n  L  (low risk)  2%   7%   5% \n  M  (medium risk)  4   9  10 \nH  (high risk)  8  13  20  Table 6.1 \n Available risky \nportfolios (Risk-free \nrate\u00a0 5\u00a05%) \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   170bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   170 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 6 Capital Allocation to Risky Assets 171\n investor\u2019s degree of risk aversion. More risk-averse investors (who have the larger values \nof  A ) penalize risky investments more severely. Investors choosing among competing \ninvestment portfolios will select the one providing the highest utility level. The box on \npage 174 discusses some techniques that financial advisers use to gauge the risk aversion \nof their clients.   \n We can interpret the utility score of  risky   portfolios as a    certainty equivalent rate    of \nreturn. The certainty equivalent rate is the rate that a risk-free investment would need to \noffer to provide the same utility score as the risky portfolio. In other words, it is the rate \nthat, if earned with certainty, would provide a utility score equivalent to that of the port-\nfolio in question. The certainty equivalent rate of return is a natural way to compare the \nutility values of competing portfolios. \n A portfolio can be desirable only if its certainty equivalent return exceeds that of the \nrisk-free alternative. A sufficiently risk-averse investor may assign any risky portfolio, \neven one with a positive risk premium, a certainty equivalent rate of return that is below \nthe risk-free rate, which will cause the investor to reject the risky portfolio. At the same \ntime, a less risk-averse investor may assign the same portfolio a certainty equivalent rate \nthat exceeds the risk-free rate and thus will prefer the portfolio to the risk-free alternative. \nIf the risk premium is zero or negative to begin with, any downward adjustment to utility \nonly makes the portfolio look worse. Its certainty equivalent rate will be below that of the \nrisk-free alternative for all risk-averse investors.  \n  Investor Risk \nAversion (  A  )    Utility Score of Portfolio   L  \n [  E  (  r  )\u00a05\u00a0.07;\u00a0 s \u00a05\u00a0.05]    Utility Score of Portfolio   M  \n [  E  (  r  )\u00a05\u00a0.09;\u00a0 s \u00a05\u00a0.10]    Utility Score of Portfolio   H \n  [  E  (  r  )\u00a05\u00a0.13;\u00a0 s \u00a05\u00a0.20]  \n 2.0  .07\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 3 \u00a02\u00a0 3 \u00a0.05 2 \u00a05\u00a0.0675  .09\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 3 \u00a02\u00a0 3 \u00a0.1 2 \u00a05\u00a0.0800   .13\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 3 \u00a02\u00a0 3 \u00a0.2 2 \u00a05\u00a0.09  \n 3.5  .07\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 3 \u00a03.5\u00a0 3 \u00a0.05 2 \u00a05\u00a0.0656   .09\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 3 \u00a03.5\u00a03\u00a0.1 2 \u00a05\u00a0.0725    .13\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 3 \u00a03.5\u00a0 3 \u00a0.2 2 \u00a05\u00a0.06 \n 5.0  .07\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 3 \u00a05\u00a0 3 \u00a0.05 2 \u00a05\u00a0.0638   .09\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 3 \u00a05\u00a0 3 \u00a0.1 2 \u00a05\u00a0.0650    .13\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 3 \u00a05\u00a0 3 \u00a0.2 2 \u00a05\u00a0.03 \n Table 6.2 \n Utility scores of alternative portfolios for investors with varying degrees of risk aversion  Consider three investors with different degrees of risk aversion:  A  1 \u00a05\u00a02,\u00a0 A  2 \u00a05\u00a03.5, and \n A  3 \u00a05\u00a05, all of whom are evaluating the three portfolios in  Table\u00a06.1 .

T-bills offer a safe rate \nof return of 7%. Would an investor with risk-aversion parameter  A \u00a05\u00a04 prefer to invest in T-bills or the \nrisky portfolio? What if  A \u00a05\u00a02?  CONCEPT CHECK 6.2 \n In contrast to risk-averse investors,    risk-neutral    investors (with  A \u00a05\u00a0 0) judge risky \nprospects solely by their expected rates of return. The level of risk is irrelevant to the risk-\nneutral investor, meaning that there is no penalty for risk. For this investor a portfolio\u2019s \ncertainty equivalent rate is simply its expected rate of return. \n A    risk lover    (for whom  A \u00a0,\u00a00) is happy to engage in fair games and gambles; this \ninvestor adjusts the expected return  upward   to take into account the \u201cfun\u201d of confronting \nthe prospect\u2019s risk. Risk lovers will always take a fair game because their upward adjust-\nment of utility for risk gives the fair game a certainty equivalent that exceeds the alterna-\ntive of the risk-free investment. \n We can depict the individual\u2019s trade-off between risk and return by plotting the char-\nacteristics of portfolios that would be equally attractive on a graph with axes measuring \nthe expected value and standard deviation of portfolio returns.  Figure\u00a06.1  plots the char-\nacteristics of one portfolio denoted  P.  \n  Portfolio  P,  which has expected return  E ( r   P  ) and standard deviation  s   P  , is preferred \nby risk-averse investors to any portfolio in quadrant IV because its expected return is \nequal to or greater than any portfolio in that quadrant and its standard deviation is equal \nto or smaller than any portfolio in that quadrant. Conversely, any portfolio in quadrant I \ndominates portfolio  P  because its expected return is equal to or greater than  P \u2019s and its \nstandard deviation is equal to or smaller than  P \u2019s. \nP\nE(rP)E(r)\n\u03c3P\u03c3II I\nIII IVNorthwest\n(preferred direction)\n Figure 6.1 The trade-off between risk and return of a potential  investment \n portfolio,  P\nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   172bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   172 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 6 Capital Allocation to Risky Assets 173\n This is the mean-standard devia-\ntion, or equivalently,    mean- variance \n(M-V) criterion    .  It can be stated as \nfollows: portfolio  A  dominates  B  if   \nE(rA)$E(rB)  \n and   \nsA#sB  \n and at least one inequality is strict \n(to rule out indifference). \n In the expected return\u2013standard \ndeviation plane in  Figure\u00a0 6.1 , the \npreferred direction is northwest, \nbecause in this direction we simul-\ntaneously increase the expected \nreturn  and  decrease the variance of \nthe rate of return. Any portfolio that \nlies northwest of  P  is superior to it. \n What can be said about portfolios \nin quadrants II and III? Their desir-\nability, compared with  P,  depends on \nthe exact nature of the investor\u2019s risk \naversion. Suppose an investor iden-\ntifies all portfolios that are equally attractive as portfolio  P.  Starting at  P,  an increase in stan-\ndard deviation lowers utility; it must be compensated for by an increase in expected return. \nThus point  Q  in  Figure\u00a06.2  is equally desirable to this investor as  P.  Investors will be equally \nattracted to portfolios with high risk and high expected returns compared with other port-\nfolios with lower risk but lower expected returns. These \nequally preferred portfolios will lie in the mean\u2013standard \ndeviation plane on a curve called the     indifference curve    ,\nwhich connects all portfolio points with the same utility \nvalue ( Figure\u00a06.2 ). \n  To determine some of the points that appear on the \nindifference curve, examine the utility values of sev-\neral possible portfolios for an investor with  A \u00a05\u00a04 ,  \npresented in  Table\u00a06.3 .

R-I-S-K.  Risk is the potential for realizing low returns or even \nlosing money, possibly preventing you from meeting \nimportant objectives, like sending your kids to the college of their choice or having the retirement lifestyle you crave. \n But many financial advisers and other experts say that \nwhen times are good, some investors don\u2019t take the idea of \nrisk as seriously as they should, and overexpose themselves to stocks. So before the market goes down and stays down, be sure that you understand your tolerance for risk and that your portfolio is designed to match it. \n Assessing your risk tolerance, however, can be tricky. \nYou must consider not only how much risk you can  afford  \nto take but also how much risk you can  stand  to take. \n Determining how much risk you can stand\u2014your tem-\nperamental tolerance for risk\u2014is more difficult. It isn\u2019t easy \nto quantify. \n To that end, many financial advisers, brokerage firms \nand mutual-fund companies have created risk quizzes to \nhelp people determine whether they are conservative, moderate or aggressive investors. Some firms that offer such quizzes include Merrill Lynch, T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Baltimore, Zurich Group Inc.\u2019s Scudder Kemper Invest-ments Inc., New York, and Vanguard Group in Malvern, Pa. \n Typically, risk questionnaires include seven to 10 ques-\ntions about a person\u2019s investing experience, financial secu-\nrity and tendency to make risky or conservative choices. \n The benefit of the questionnaires is that they are an \nobjective resource people can use to get at least a rough \nidea of their risk tolerance. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for someone to assess their risk tolerance alone,\u201d says Mr. Bernstein. \u201cI may say I don\u2019t like risk, yet will take more risk than the average person.\u201d  Many experts warn, however, that the questionnaires \nshould be used simply as a first step to assessing risk toler-\nance. \u201cThey are not precise,\u201d says Ron Meier, a certified public accountant. \n The second step, many experts agree, is to ask yourself \nsome difficult questions, such as: How much you can stand \nto lose over the long term? \n \u201cMost people can stand to lose a heck of a lot tempo-\nrarily,\u201d says Mr. Schatsky, a financial adviser in New York. \nThe real acid test, he says, is how much of your portfolio\u2019s value you can stand to lose over months or years. \n As it turns out, most people rank as middle-of-the-road \nrisk-takers, say several advisers. \u201cOnly about 10% to 15% \nof my clients are aggressive,\u201d says Mr. Roge. \n  WHAT\u2019S YOUR RISK TOLERANCE? \n Circle the letter that corresponds to your answer \n      1.

A number of meth-ods may be used. The questionnaire in the nearby box is of the simplest variety and, indeed, can distinguish only between high (conservative), medium (moderate), or low (aggressive) levels of the coefficient of risk aversion. More complex questionnaires, allowing subjects to pinpoint specific levels of risk aversion coefficients, ask would-be investors to choose from various sets of hypothetical lotteries. \n  \n Access to investment accounts of active investors would provide observations of how \nportfolio composition changes over time. Coupling this information with estimates of the \nrisk\u2013return combinations of these positions would in principle allow us to calculate inves-tors\u2019 implied risk aversion coefficients. \n Finally, researchers track behavior of groups of individuals to obtain average degrees \nof risk aversion. These studies range from observed purchase of insurance policies and durables warranties to labor supply and aggregate consumption behavior.    \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   174bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   174 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n175   2B.

WORDS FROM THE STREET \n   6.2 Capital Allocation across Risky \nand Risk-Free Portfolios \n  History shows us that long-term bonds have been riskier investments than Treasury bills \nand that stocks have been riskier still. On the other hand, the riskier investments have offered higher average returns. Investors, of course, do not make all-or-nothing choices from these investment classes. They can and do construct their portfolios using securities from all asset classes. Some of the portfolio may be in risk-free Treasury bills, some in high-risk stocks. \n The most straightforward way to control the risk of the portfolio is through the fraction \nof the portfolio invested in Treasury bills and other safe money market securities versus risky assets. A capital allocation decision implies an asset allocation choice among broad investment classes, rather than among the specific securities within each asset class. Most investment professionals consider asset allocation the most important part of portfolio \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   175bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   175 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n176 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nconstruction. Consider this statement by John Bogle, made when he was chairman of the \nVanguard Group of Investment Companies: \n  The most fundamental decision of investing is the allocation of your assets: How much \nshould you own in stock? How much should you own in bonds? How much should you own in cash reserves? .\u00a0.\u00a0. That decision [has been shown to account] for an astonish-ing 94% of the differences in total returns achieved by institutionally managed pension funds.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. There is no reason to believe that the same relationship does not also hold true for individual investors.  \n1     \n Therefore, we start our discussion of the risk\u2013return trade-off available to investors by \nexamining the most basic asset allocation choice: the choice of how much of the portfolio to place in risk-free money market securities versus other risky asset classes. \n We denote the investor\u2019s portfolio of risky assets as  P  and the risk-free asset as  F.  We \nassume for the sake of illustration that the risky component of the investor\u2019s overall portfo-lio comprises two mutual funds, one invested in stocks and the other invested in long-term bonds. For now, we take the composition of the risky portfolio as given and focus only on the allocation between it and risk-free securities. In the next chapter, we turn to asset allo-cation and security selection across risky assets. \n When we shift wealth from the risky portfolio to the risk-free asset, we do not change \nthe relative proportions of the various risky assets within the risky portfolio. Rather, we reduce the relative weight of the risky portfolio as a whole in favor of risk-free assets. \n For example, assume that the total market value of an initial portfolio is $300,000, of \nwhich $90,000 is invested in the Ready Asset money market fund, a risk-free asset for practical purposes. The remaining $210,000 is invested in risky securities\u2014$113,400 in equities ( E ) and $96,600 in long-term bonds ( B ).

In \nthis sense we may treat the risky fund as a single risky asset, that asset being a particular bundle of securities. As we shift in and out of safe assets, we simply alter our holdings of that bundle of securities commensurately. \n With this simplification, we turn to the desirability of reducing risk by changing the \nrisky/risk-free asset mix, that is, reducing risk by decreasing the proportion  y.  As long as \nwe do not alter the weights of each security within the risky portfolio, the probability dis-tribution of the rate of return on the risky portfolio remains unchanged by the asset reallo-cation. What will change is the probability distribution of the rate of return on the  complete  \nportfolio that consists of the risky asset and the risk-free asset. \n    Suppose that the owner of this portfolio wishes to decrease risk by reducing the alloca-\ntion to the risky portfolio from  y \u00a05\u00a0.7 to  y \u00a05\u00a0.56. The risky portfolio would then total only \n.56\u00a0 3 \u00a0$300,000\u00a0 5\u00a0$168,000, requiring the sale of $42,000 of the original $210,000 of \nrisky holdings, with the proceeds used to purchase more shares in Ready Asset (the money \nmarket fund). Total holdings in the risk-free asset will increase to $300,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.56)\u00a0 5\u00a0\n$132,000, the original holdings plus the new contribution to the money market fund:   \n $90,0001$42,0005$132,000  \n The key point, however, is that we leave the proportions of each asset in the risky port-\nfolio unchanged. Because the weights of  E  and  B  in the risky portfolio are .54 and .46, \nrespectively, we sell .54\u00a0 3 \u00a0$42,000\u00a0 5\u00a0$22,680 of  E  and .46\u00a0 3 \u00a0$42,000\u00a0 5\u00a0$19,320 of  B.  \nAfter the sale, the proportions of each asset in the risky portfolio are in fact unchanged:   \n  E:\u00a0wE5113,400222,680\n210,000242,0005.54\n  B:\u00a0wB596,600219,320\n210,000242,0005.46   Example 6.2 The Risky Portfolio \n What will be the dollar value of your position in equities ( E ), and its proportion in your overall portfolio, if \nyou decide to hold 50% of your investment budget in Ready Asset?  CONCEPT CHECK 6.4 \n   6.3 The Risk-Free Asset \n  By virtue of its power to tax and control the money supply, only the government can issue \ndefault-free bonds. Even the default-free guarantee by itself is not sufficient to make the bonds risk-free in real terms. The only risk-free asset in real terms would be a perfectly price-indexed bond. Moreover, a default-free perfectly indexed bond offers a guaranteed real rate to an investor only if the maturity of the bond is identical to the investor\u2019s desired holding period. Even indexed bonds are subject to interest rate risk, because real interest rates change unpredictably through time. When future real rates are uncertain, so is the future price of indexed bonds. \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   177bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   177 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 7 8 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n Nevertheless, it is \ncom mon practice to \nview Treasury bills as \n\u201cthe\u201d    risk-free asset    .\nTheir short-term nature \nmakes their values \ninsensitive to inter-\nest rate fluctuations. \nIndeed, an investor can \nlock in a short-term \nnominal return by buy-\ning a bill and holding it \nto maturity. Moreover, \ninflation uncertainty \nover the course of a few \nweeks, or even months, \nis negligible compared \nwith the uncertainty of \nstock market returns. \n In practice, most \ninvestors use a broad \nrange of money market \ninstruments as a risk-\nfree asset. All the money market instruments are virtually free of interest rate risk because \nof their short maturities and are fairly safe in terms of default or credit risk. \n Most money market funds hold, for the most part, three types of securities\u2014Treasury \nbills, bank certificates of deposit (CDs), and commercial paper (CP)\u2014differing slightly \nin their default risk. The yields to maturity on CDs and CP for an identical maturity, for \nexample, are always somewhat higher than those of T-bills. The recent history of this yield \nspread for 90-day CDs is shown in  Figure\u00a06.3 . \n  Money market funds have changed their relative holdings of these securities over time \nbut, by and large, T-bills make up only about 15% of their portfolios.  2   Nevertheless, the risk \nof such blue-chip short-term investments as CDs and CP is minuscule compared with that of \nmost other assets such as long-term corporate bonds, common stocks, or real estate. Hence \nwe treat money market funds as the most easily accessible risk-free asset for most investors.     \n Figure 6.3 Spread between 3-month CD and T-bill rates  \n1970\n1972\n1974\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014OPEC I\nOPEC ll\nPenn Square\nMarket Crash\nLTCMCredit Crisis\n0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.55.0\nPercentage Points\n  2 See   http://www.icifactbook.org/  , Section 4 of Data Tables.    6.4 Portfolios of One Risky Asset \nand a Risk-Free Asset \n  In this section we examine the feasible risk\u2013return combinations available to investors \nwhen the choice of the risky portfolio has already been made.

The remaining proportion, 1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 y,  is to be invested in the risk-free \nasset,  F.  \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   178bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   178 7/25/13   6:16 AM7/25/13   6:16 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 6 Capital Allocation to Risky Assets 179\n Denote the risky rate of return of  P  by  r   P  , its expected rate of return by  E ( r   P  ), and its \nstandard deviation by  s   P  . The rate of return on the risk-free asset is denoted as  r   f  . In the \nnumerical example we assume that  E ( r   P  )\u00a05\u00a0 15%,\u00a0  s   P  \u00a05\u00a0 22%, and the risk-free rate is \n r   f  \u00a05\u00a07%. Thus the risk premium on the risky asset is  E ( r   P  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a05\u00a08%. \n With a proportion,  y,  in the risky portfolio, and 1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 y  in the risk-free asset, the rate of \nreturn on the  complete   portfolio, denoted  C,  is  r   C   where   \n rC5yrP1(12y)rf  (6.2)   \n Taking the expectation of this portfolio\u2019s rate of return,   \n  E(rC)5yE(rP)1(12y)rf\n  5rf1y3E(rP)2rf4571y(1527)  (6.3)\n   \n This result is easily interpreted. The base rate of return for any portfolio is the risk-free \nrate. In addition, the portfolio is  expected   to earn a proportion,  y,  of the risk premium of the \nrisky portfolio,  E ( r   P  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  . Investors are assumed risk averse and unwilling to take a risky \nposition without a positive risk premium. \n With a proportion  y  in a risky asset, the standard deviation of the complete portfolio is \nthe standard deviation of the risky asset multiplied by the weight,  y,  of the risky asset in \nthat portfolio.  3   Because the standard deviation of the risky portfolio is  s   P  \u00a05\u00a022%,   \n sC5ysP522y  (6.4)    \n which makes sense because the standard deviation of the portfolio is proportional to both \nthe standard deviation of the risky asset and the proportion invested in it. In sum, the \nexpected return of the complete portfolio is  E ( r   C  )\u00a05\u00a0 r   f  \u00a01\u00a0 y [ E ( r   P  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  ]\u00a05\u00a07\u00a01\u00a08 y  and the \nstandard deviation is  s   C  \u00a05\u00a022 y.  \n The next step is to plot the  portfolio characteristics (with various choices for  y ) in the \nexpected return\u2013standard deviation plane in  Figure\u00a0 6.4 . The risk-free asset,  F,  appears \non the vertical axis because its standard \ndeviation is zero. The risky asset,  P,  is \nplotted with a standard deviation  of  22%, \nand expected return of 15%. If an investor \nchooses to invest solely in the risky asset, \nthen  y \u00a05\u00a01.0, and the complete portfolio \nis  P.  If the chosen position is  y \u00a05\u00a00, then \n1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 y \u00a05\u00a01.0, and the complete portfolio is \nthe risk-free portfolio  F.  \n What about the more interesting mid-\nrange portfolios where  y  lies between 0 \nand 1? These portfolios will graph on the \nstraight line connecting points  F  and  P.  \nThe slope of that line is [ E ( r   P  )\u00a0  2 \u00a0 r   f  ]/ s   P   \n(rise/run), in this case, 8/22. \n The conclusion is straightforward. \nIncreasing the fraction of the overall port-\nfolio invested in the risky asset increases \nexpected return at a rate of 8%, according \nto Equation 6.3. It also increases portfolio \n3 This is an application of a basic rule from statistics: If you multiply a random variable by a constant, the standard \ndeviation is multiplied by the same constant. In our application, the random variable is the rate of return on the \nrisky asset, and the constant is the fraction of that asset in the complete portfolio. We will elaborate on the rules \nfor portfolio return and risk in the following chapter. \n Figure 6.4 The investment opportunity set with a risky asset and \na risk-free asset in the expected return\u2013standard  deviation plane  \nE(r)\n \u03c3P = 22%E(rP) = 15%\n\u03c3r\u0192 = 7%\nFP\nE(rP) \u2212 r\u0192 = 8%CAL = Capital\n           Allocation\n           Line\n S = 8/22\nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   179bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   179 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n180 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nstandard deviation at the rate of 22%, according to Equation 6.4. The extra return per extra risk \nis thus 8/22\u00a05 \u00a0.36. \n To derive the exact equation for the straight line between  F  and  P,  we rearrange \nEquation 6.4 to find that  y \u00a05\u00a0 s   C  / s   P  , and we substitute for  y  in Equation 6.3 to describe the \nexpected return\u2013standard deviation trade-off:   \n  E(rC)5rf1y3E(rP)2rf4\n  5rf1sC\nsP 3E(rP)2rf45718\n22 sC  (6.5)\n   \n Thus the expected return of the complete portfolio as a function of its standard devia-\ntion is a straight line, with intercept  r   f   and slope   \n S5E(rP)2rf\nsP58\n22  (6.6)   \n  Figure\u00a06.4  graphs the  investment opportunity set,  which is the set of feasible expected \nreturn and standard deviation pairs of all portfolios resulting from different values of  y.  The \ngraph is a straight line originating at  r   f   and going through the point labeled  P.  \n  This straight line is called the    capital allocation line    (CAL). It depicts all the risk\u2013return \ncombinations available to investors. The slope of the CAL, denoted  S,  equals the increase \nin the expected return of the complete portfolio per unit of additional standard deviation\u2014\nin other words, incremental return per incremental risk. For this reason, the slope is called the    reward-to-volatility ratio    .   It also is called the Sharpe ratio (see Chapter 5). \n A portfolio equally divided between the risky asset and the risk-free asset, that is, where \n y \u00a05\u00a0.5, will have an expected rate of return of  E ( r  \n C  )\u00a05\u00a07\u00a01\u00a0.5\u00a0 3 \u00a08\u00a05\u00a011%, implying a risk \npremium of 4%, and a standard deviation of  s   C  \u00a05\u00a0.5\u00a0 3 \u00a022\u00a0 5\u00a011%.

The investor confronting the CAL now must choose \none optimal portfolio,  C,  from the set of feasible choices. This choice entails a trade-off \nbetween risk and return. Individual differences in risk aversion lead to different capital \nallocation choices even when facing an identical opportunity set (that is, a risk-free rate \nand a reward-to-volatility ratio). In particular, more risk-averse investors will choose to \nhold less of the risky asset and more of the risk-free asset. \n The expected return on the complete portfolio is given by Equation 6.3: \nE ( r   C  )\u00a05\u00a0 r   f  \u00a01\u00a0 y [ E ( r   P  )\u00a0  2 \u00a0 r   f  ]. Its variance is, from Equation 6.4,    sC25y2sP2.  Investors \nchoose the allocation to the risky asset,  y,  that maximizes their utility function as given by \nEquation 6.1:  U \u00a05\u00a0 E ( r )\u00a0 2 \u00a0\u00bd\u00a0 A  s  2 . As the allocation to the risky asset increases (higher \ny ), expected return increases, but so does volatility, so utility can increase or decrease. \n Table\u00a0 6.4  shows utility levels corresponding to different values of  y.  Initially, utility \nincreases as  y  increases, but eventually it declines.  \n  Figure\u00a06.6  is a plot of the utility function from  Table\u00a06.4 . The graph shows that utility \nis highest at  y \u00a05\u00a0.41. When  y  is less than .41, investors are willing to assume more risk to \nincrease expected return. But at higher levels of  y,  risk is higher, and additional allocations \nto the risky asset are undesirable\u2014beyond this point, further increases in risk dominate the \nincrease in expected return and reduce utility. \n  To solve the utility maximization problem more generally, we write the problem as follows:\n Max y U5E(rC)2\u00bd AsC25rf1y3E(rP)2rf42\u00bd Ay2sP2\n   Students of calculus will recognize that the maximization problem is solved by setting \nthe derivative of this expression to zero.

To illustrate how to build an indifference curve, consider an investor with \nrisk aversion  A5\u00a04 who currently holds all her wealth in a risk-free portfolio yielding  Using our numerical example [ r   f  \u00a05\u00a07%,\u00a0 E ( r   P  )\u00a05\u00a015%, and  s   P  \u00a05\u00a022%], and expressing all \nreturns as decimals, the optimal solution for an investor with a coefficient of risk aver-\nsion  A \u00a05\u00a04 is   \ny*5.152.07\n43.2225.41  \n In other words, this particular investor will invest 41% of the investment budget in the \nrisky asset and 59% in the risk-free asset. As we saw in  Figure\u00a06.6 , this is the value of  y\nat which utility is maximized. \n With 41% invested in the risky portfolio, the expected return and standard deviation \nof the complete portfolio are   \n E(rC)5713.413(1527)4510.28%\n  sC5.4132259.02%  \n The risk premium of the complete portfolio is  E ( r   C  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a05\u00a03.28%, which is obtained by \ntaking on a portfolio with a standard deviation of 9.02%.

Because the variance of such a portfolio is zero, Equation 6.1 tells us that its \nutility value is  U \u00a05\u00a0.05. Now we find the expected return the investor would require \nto maintain the  same   level of utility when holding a risky portfolio, say, with  s \u00a05\u00a01%. \nWe use Equation 6.1 to find how much  E ( r ) must increase to compensate for the higher \nvalue of  s :   \n U5E(r)2\u00bd3A3s2\n .055E(r)2\u00bd343.012  \n This implies that the necessary expected return increases to   \n  Required E(r)5.051\u00bd3A3s2\n  5.051\u00bd343.0125.0502   (6.8)   \n We can repeat this calculation for other levels of  s , each time finding the value of  E ( r ) \nnecessary to maintain  U \u00a05\u00a0.05. This process will yield all combinations of expected return \nand volatility with utility level of .05; plotting these combinations gives us the indifference \ncurve. \n We can readily generate an investor\u2019s indifference curves using a spreadsheet.  Table\u00a06.5  \ncontains risk\u2013return combinations with utility values of .05 and .09 for two investors, one \nwith  A \u00a05\u00a02 and the other with  A \u00a05\u00a04. The plot of these indifference curves appears in \n Figure\u00a06.7 . Notice that the intercepts of the indifference curves are at .05 and .09, exactly \nthe level of utility corresponding to the two curves.  \n Any investor would prefer a portfolio on the higher indifference curve with a higher cer-\ntainty equivalent (utility). Portfolios on higher indifference curves offer a higher expected \nreturn for any given level of risk. For example, both indifference curves for  A \u00a05\u00a02 have \nthe same shape, but for any level of volatility, a portfolio on the curve with utility of .09 \noffers an expected return 4% greater than the corresponding portfolio on the lower curve, \nfor which  U \u00a05\u00a0.05. \n  Figure\u00a0 6.7  demonstrates that more risk-averse investors have steeper indifference \ncurves than less risk-averse investors.

The tangency point occurs at  s   C  \u00a05\u00a09.02% \nand  E ( r   C  )\u00a05\u00a010.28%, the risk\u2013return parameters of the optimal complete portfolio with \ny *\u00a05\u00a00.41. These values match our algebraic solution using Equation 6.7. \n We conclude that the choice for  y *, the fraction of overall investment funds to place in \nthe risky portfolio, is determined by risk aversion (the slope of indifference curves) and the \nSharpe ratio (the slope of the opportunity set). \n In sum, capital allocation determines the complete portfolio, which constitutes the \ninvestor\u2019s entire wealth. Portfolio  P  represents all-wealth-at-risk. Hence, when returns are \nnormally distributed, standard deviation is the appropriate measure of risk. In future chap-\nters we will consider augmenting  P  with \u201cgood\u201d additions, meaning assets that improve \nthe feasible risk-return trade-off. The risk of these potential additions will have to be mea-\nsured by their  incremental   effect on the standard deviation of  P.  \n  Nonnormal Returns \n In the foregoing analysis we assumed normality of returns by taking the standard devia-\ntion as the appropriate measure of risk. But as we discussed in Chapter 5, departures from \nnormality could result in extreme losses with far greater likelihood than would be plausible \nunder a normal distribution. These exposures, which are typically measured by value at \nrisk (VaR) or expected shortfall (ES), also would be important to investors. \n Therefore, an appropriate extension of our analysis would be to present investors with \nforecasts of VaR and ES. Taking the capital allocation from the normal-based analysis \nas a benchmark, investors facing fat-tailed distributions might consider reducing their \nallocation to the risky portfolio in favor of an increase in the allocation to the risk-free \nvehicle. \n    s      U \u00a0 5\u00a0.07    U \u00a0 5\u00a0.078    U \u00a0 5\u00a0.08653    U \u00a0 5\u00a0.094    CAL  \n 0  .0700  .0780  .0865  .0940  .0700 \n .02  .0708  .0788  .0873  .0948  .0773 \n .04  .0732  .0812  .0897  .0972  .0845 \n .06  .0772  .0852  .0937  .1012  .0918 \n .08  .0828  .0908  .0993  .1068  .0991 \n .0902  .0863  .0943  .1028  .1103  .1028 \n .10  .0900  .0980  .1065  .1140  .1064 \n .12  .0988  .1068  .1153  .1228  .1136 \n .14  .1092  .1172  .1257  .1332  .1209 \n .18  .1348  .1428  .1513  .1588  .1355 \n .22  .1668  .1748  .1833  .1908  .1500 \n .26  .2052  .2132  .2217  .2292  .1645 \n .30  .2500  .2580  .2665  .2740  .1791  Table 6.6 \n Expected returns on \nfour indifference \ncurves and the CAL. \nInvestor\u2019s risk aver-\nsion is  A \u00a05\u00a04. \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   186bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   186 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 6 Capital Allocation to Risky Assets  187\n There are signs of advances in dealing with extreme values (in addition to new tech-\nniques to handle transaction data mentioned in Chapter 5). Back in the early 20th century, \nFrank Knight, one of the great economists of the time, distinguished  risk  from  uncertainty,  \nthe difference being that risk is a known problem in which probabilities can be ascertained while uncertainty is characterized by ignorance even about probabilities (reminiscent of the black swan problem). Hence, Knight argued, we must use different methods to handle uncertainty and risk. \n Probabilities of moderate outcomes in finance can be readily assessed from experience \nbecause of the high relative frequency of such observations. Extreme negative values are blissfully rare, but for that very reason, accurately assessing their probabilities is virtually impossible. However, the Bayesian statistics that took center stage in decision making in later periods rejected Knight\u2019s approach on the argument that even if probabilities are hard to estimate objectively, investors nevertheless have a notion, albeit subjective, of what they may be and must use those beliefs to make economic decisions. In the Bayesian frame-work, these so-called priors must be used even if they apply to unprecedented events that characterize uncertainty. Accordingly, in this school of thought, the distinction between risk and uncertainty is deemed irrelevant. \n Economists today are coming around to Knight\u2019s position. Advanced utility functions \nattempt to distinguish risk from uncertainty and give these uncertain outcomes a larger role in the choice of portfolios. These approaches have yet to enter everyday practice, but as they are developed, practical measures are certain to follow.      \n   6.6 Passive Strategies: The Capital Market Line     a.  If an investor\u2019s coefficient of risk aversion is  A \u00a05\u00a03, how does the optimal asset mix change? What are \nthe new values of  E ( r   C  ) and  s   C  ?  \n    b.  Suppose that the borrowing rate,    rfB59%  is greater than the lending rate,  r   f  \u00a05\u00a07%. Show graphically \nhow the optimal portfolio choice of some investors will be affected by the higher borrowing rate. \nWhich investors will  not  be affected by the borrowing rate?    CONCEPT CHECK 6.7  \n  The CAL is derived with the risk-free and \u201cthe\u201d risky portfolio,  P.  Determination of the \nassets to include in  P  may result from a passive or an active strategy. A    passive strategy    \ndescribes a portfolio decision that avoids  any  direct or indirect security analysis.  6   At first \nblush, a passive strategy would appear to be naive. As will become apparent, however, \nforces of supply and demand in large capital markets may make such a strategy the reason-able choice for many investors.\n  \n In Chapter 5, we presented a compilation of the history of rates of return on differ-\nent portfolios. The data are available at Professor Kenneth French\u2019s Web site,   mba.tuck\n.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html  . We can use these data to \nexamine various passive strategies. \n A natural candidate for a passively held risky asset would be a well-diversified portfolio \nof common stocks such as \u201cAll U.S.\u201d described in Chapter 5. Because a passive strategy \n  6 By \u201cindirect security analysis\u201d we mean the delegation of that responsibility to an intermediary such as a \n professional money manager. \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   187bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   187 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1 8 8 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nrequires that we devote no resources to acquiring information on any individual stock or \ngroup of stocks, we must follow a \u201cneutral\u201d diversification strategy. One way is to select \na diversified portfolio of stocks that mirrors the value of the corporate sector of the U.S. \neconomy. This results in a portfolio in which, for example, the proportion invested in \nMicrosoft stock will be the ratio of Microsoft\u2019s total market value to the market value of \nall listed stocks. \n The most popular value-weighted index of U.S. stocks is the Standard & Poor\u2019s \nComposite Index of 500 large capitalization U.S. corporations (the S&P 500).  Table 6.7  \n summarizes the performance of the S&P 500 portfolio over the 87-year period 1926\u20132012, \nas well as for four subperiods.  Table 6.7  shows the average return for the portfolio, the return \non rolling over 1-month T-bills for the same period, as well as the resultant average excess \nreturn and its standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio was .40 for the overall period, 1926\u20132012. \nIn other words, stock market investors enjoyed a .40% average excess return over the T-bill \nrate for every 1% of standard deviation. The large standard deviation of the excess return \n(20.48%) is one reason we observe a wide range of average excess returns and Sharpe ratios \nacross subperiods (varying from .21 to .74). Using the statistical distribution of the difference \nbetween the Sharpe ratios of two portfolios, we can estimate the probability of observing a \ndeviation of the Sharpe ratio for a particular subperiod from that of the overall period, assum-\ning the latter is the true value. The last column of  Table 6.7  shows that the probabilities of \nfinding such widely different Sharpe ratios over the subperiods are actually quite substantial.  \n We call the capital allocation line provided by 1-month T-bills and a broad index of \ncommon stocks the    capital market line    (CML). A passive strategy generates an invest-\nment opportunity set that is represented by the CML. \n How reasonable is it for an investor to pursue a passive strategy? We cannot answer \nsuch a question without comparing the strategy to the costs and benefits accruing to an \nactive portfolio strategy. Some thoughts are relevant at this point, however. \n First, the alternative active strategy is not free. Whether you choose to invest the time \nand cost to acquire the information needed to generate an optimal active portfolio of risky \nassets, or whether you delegate the task to a professional who will charge a fee, constitution \nof an active portfolio is more expensive than a passive one.

At the same time, they poured $30.4 billion into U.S. stock exchange-traded funds. \n The move reflects the fact that many money manag-\ners of stock funds, which charge fees but also dangle the \nprospect of higher returns, have underperformed the benchmark stock indexes. As a result, more investors are choosing simply to invest in funds tracking the indexes, which carry lower fees and are perceived as having less risk. \n The mission of stock pickers in a managed mutual fund \nis to outperform the overall market by actively trading \nindividual stocks or bonds, with fund managers receiving higher fees for their effort. In an ETF (or indexed mutual fund), managers balance the share makeup of the fund so it accurately reflects the performance of its underlying index, charging lower fees.  Morningstar says that when investors have put money in \nstock funds, they have chosen low-cost index funds and ETFs. \nSome index ETFs cost less than 0.1% of assets a year, while many actively managed stock funds charge 1% a year or more. \n While the trend has put increasing pressure lately on \nstock pickers, it is shifting the fortunes of some of the big-\ngest players in the $14 trillion mutual-fund industry. \n Fidelity Investments and American Funds, among the \nlargest in the category, saw redemptions or weak investor \ninterest compared with competitors, according to an anal-ysis of mutual-fund flows done for  The Wall Street Journal  \nby research firm Strategic Insight, a unit of New York-based Asset International. \n At the other end of the spectrum, Vanguard, the \nworld\u2019s largest provider of index mutual funds, pulled in a \nnet $141 billion last year through December, according to the company. \n Many investors say they are looking for a way to invest \ncheaply, with less risk. \n  Source:  Adapted from Kirsten Grind,  The   Wall Street Journal,  \nJanuary 3, 2013.

Vanguard, for example, oper-\nates the Index 500 Portfolio that mimics the S&P 500 index fund. It purchases shares of the firms constituting the S&P 500 in proportion to the market values of the outstanding equity of each firm, and therefore essentially replicates the S&P 500 index. The fund thus dupli-cates the performance of this market index. It has one of the lowest operating expenses (as a percentage of assets) of all mutual stock funds precisely because it requires minimal managerial effort. \n A second reason to pursue a passive strategy is the free-rider benefit. If there are many \nactive, knowledgeable investors who quickly bid up prices of undervalued assets and force down prices of overvalued assets (by selling), we have to conclude that at any time most assets will be fairly priced. Therefore, a well-diversified portfolio of common stock will be a reasonably fair buy, and the passive strategy may not be inferior to that of the average active investor. (We will elaborate on this argument and provide a more comprehensive analysis of the relative success of passive strategies in later chapters.) The nearby box points out that passive index funds have actually outperformed most actively managed funds in the past decades and that investors are responding to the lower costs and better performance of index funds by directing their investments into these products. \n To summarize, a passive strategy involves investment in two passive portfolios: virtu-\nally risk-free short-term T-bills (or, alternatively, a money market fund) and a fund of com-mon stocks that mimics a broad market index. The capital allocation line representing such a strategy is called the  capital market line.  Historically, based on 1926 to 2012 data, the \npassive risky portfolio offered an average risk premium of 8.1% and a standard deviation of 20.48%, resulting in a reward-to-volatility ratio of .40.  \n Passive investors allocate their investment budgets among instruments according to \ntheir degree of risk aversion. We can use our analysis to deduce a typical investor\u2019s risk-aversion parameter. From Table 1.1 in Chapter 1, we estimate that approximately 65.6% \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   189bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   189 8/1/13   7:56 AM8/1/13   7:56 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm190 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nof net worth is invested in a broad array of risky assets.  7   We assume this portfolio has \nthe same reward\u2013risk characteristics that the S&P 500 has exhibited since 1926, as docu-\nmented in  Table 6.7.  Substituting these values in Equation 6.7, we obtain   \ny*5E(rM)2rf\nAsM25.081\nA3.204825.656   \n which implies a coefficient of risk aversion of   \nA5.081\n.6563.2048252.94  \n Of course, this calculation is highly speculative. We have assumed that the average \ninvestor holds the naive view that historical average rates of return and standard devia-\ntions are the best estimates of expected rates of return and risk, looking to the future. To the extent that the average investor takes advantage of contemporary information in addition to simple historical data, our estimate of  A \u00a05\u00a02.94 would be an unjustified \ninference. Nevertheless, a broad range of studies, taking into account the full range of available assets, places the degree of risk aversion for the representative investor in the range of 2.0 to 4.0.  \n8       \n  7 We include in the risky portfolio real assets, half of pension reserves, corporate and noncorporate equity, and \nhalf of mutual fund shares. This portfolio sums to $50.05 trillion, which is 65.6% of household net worth. (See \nTable 1.1.) \n   8 See, for example, I. Friend and M. Blume, \u201cThe Demand for Risky Assets,\u201d  American Economic Review  64 \n(1974); or S. J. Grossman and R. J. Shiller, \u201cThe Determinants of the Variability of Stock Market Prices,\u201d \n American Economic Review  71 (1981).   Suppose that expectations about the S&P 500 index and the T-bill rate are the same as they were in 2012, \nbut you find that a greater proportion is invested in T-bills today than in 2012. What can you conclude about the change in risk tolerance over the years since 2012?  CONCEPT CHECK 6.8 \n   SUMMARY      1 .   Speculation is the undertaking of a risky investment for its risk premium. The risk premium has to be large enough to compensate a risk-averse investor for the risk of the investment.  \n    2.  A fair game is a risky prospect that has a zero risk premium. It will not be undertaken by a risk-averse investor.  \n    3.  Investors\u2019 preferences toward the expected return and volatility of a portfolio may be expressed by a utility function that is higher for higher expected returns and lower for higher portfolio variances. More risk-averse investors will apply greater penalties for risk. We can describe these preferences graphically using indifference curves.  \n    4.  The desirability of a risky portfolio to a risk-averse investor may be summarized by the cer-tainty equivalent value of the portfolio. The certainty equivalent rate of return is a value that, if it is received with certainty, would yield the same utility as the risky portfolio.  \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   190bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   190 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 6 Capital Allocation to Risky Assets  191\n    5.  Shifting funds from the risky portfolio to the risk-free asset is the simplest way to reduce risk. \nOther methods involve diversification of the risky portfolio and hedging. We take up these methods in later chapters.  \n    6.  T-bills provide a perfectly risk-free asset in nominal terms only. Nevertheless, the standard deviation of real rates on short-term T-bills is small compared to that of other assets such as long-term bonds and common stocks, so for the purpose of our analysis we consider T-bills as the risk-free asset. Money market funds hold, in addition to T-bills, short-term relatively safe obligations such as CP and CDs. These entail some default risk, but again, the additional risk is small relative to most other risky assets. For convenience, we often refer to money market funds as risk-free assets.  \n    7 .   An investor\u2019s risky portfolio (the risky asset) can be characterized by its reward-to- volatility ratio,  S \u00a05\u00a0[  E ( r  \n P  )\u00a0  2 \u00a0 r   f  ]/ s   P  . This ratio is also the slope of the CAL, the line that, when \ngraphed, goes from the risk-free asset through the risky asset. All combinations of the risky \nasset and the risk-free asset lie on this line. Other things equal, an investor would prefer a steeper-sloping CAL, because that means higher expected return for any level of risk. If the borrowing rate is greater than the lending rate, the CAL will be \u201ckinked\u201d at the point of the risky asset.  \n    8.  The investor\u2019s degree of risk aversion is characterized by the slope of his or her indifference curve. Indifference curves show, at any level of expected return and risk, the required risk pre-mium for taking on one additional percentage point of standard deviation. More risk-averse investors have steeper indifference curves; that is, they require a greater risk premium for taking on more risk.  \n    9.  The optimal position ,   y *, in the risky asset, is proportional to the risk premium and inversely \nproportional to the variance and degree of risk aversion:\n   \ny*5E(rP)2rf\nAsP2  \n   Graphically, this portfolio represents the point at which the indifference curve is tangent to the \nCAL.  \n    10.  A passive investment strategy disregards security analysis, targeting instead the risk-free asset \nand a broad portfolio of risky assets such as the S&P 500 stock portfolio. If in 2012 inves-tors took the mean historical return and standard deviation of the S&P 500 as proxies for its expected return and standard deviation, then the values of outstanding assets would imply a degree of risk aversion of about  A \u00a05\u00a02.94 for the average investor. This is in line with other stud-\nies, which estimate typical risk aversion in the range of 2.0 through 4.0.

Which of the following choices best completes the following statement? Explain. An investor \nwith a higher degree of risk aversion, compared to one with a lower degree, will prefer invest-\nment portfolios \n    a.  with higher risk premiums.  \n    b.  that are riskier (with higher standard deviations).  \n    c.  with lower Sharpe ratios.  \n    d.  with higher Sharpe ratios.  \n    e.  None of the above is true.     \n   2. Which of the following statements are true? Explain. \n    a.  A lower allocation to the risky portfolio reduces the Sharpe (reward-to-volatility) ratio.      b .  The higher the borrowing rate, the lower the Sharpe ratios of levered portfolios.  \n    c.  With a fixed risk-free rate, doubling the expected return and standard deviation of the risky \nportfolio will double the Sharpe ratio.  \n    d.  Holding constant the risk premium of the risky portfolio, a higher risk-free rate will increase \nthe Sharpe ratio of investments with a positive allocation to the risky asset.     \n   3. What do you think would happen to the expected return on stocks if investors perceived higher \nvolatility in the equity market? Relate your answer to Equation 6.7.      \n   4. Consider a risky portfolio. The end-of-year cash flow derived from the portfolio will be either \n$70,000 or $200,000 with equal probabilities of .5. The alternative risk-free investment in T-bills pays 6% per year. \n    a .  If you require a risk premium of 8%, how much will you be willing to pay for the \nportfolio?  \n    b.  Suppose that the portfolio can be purchased for the amount you found in ( a ). What will be \nthe expected rate of return on the portfolio?  \n    c.  Now suppose that you require a risk premium of 12%. What is the price that you will be \n willing to pay?  \n    d.  Comparing your answers to ( a ) and ( c ), what do you conclude about the relationship \nbetween the required risk premium on a portfolio and the price at which the portfolio \nwill sell?     \n   5. Consider a portfolio that offers an expected rate of return of 12% and a standard deviation of \n18%. T-bills offer a risk-free 7% rate of return. What is the maximum level of risk aversion for which the risky portfolio is still preferred to bills?  \n   6. Draw the indifference curve in the expected return\u2013standard deviation plane corresponding \nto a utility level of .05 for an investor with a risk aversion coefficient of 3. ( Hint:  Choose \nseveral possible standard deviations, ranging from 0 to .25, and find the expected rates of return providing a utility level of .05. Then plot the expected return\u2013standard deviation points so derived.)  \n   7. Now draw the indifference curve corresponding to a utility level of .05 for an investor \nwith risk aversion coefficient  A \u00a05\u00a0 4. Comparing your answer to Problem 6, what do you \nconclude?  \n   8. Draw an indifference curve for a risk-neutral investor providing utility level .05.  \n   9.

Consider the following information about a risky portfolio that you manage, and a risk-free \nasset:  E ( r   P  )\u00a05\u00a011%,\u00a0 s   P  \u00a05\u00a015%,\u00a0 r   f  \u00a05\u00a05%. \n    a .

What \n proportion should she invest in the risky portfolio,  P,  and what proportion in the risk-free \nasset?  \n    b.  What will be the standard deviation of the rate of return on her portfolio?  \n    c.  Another client wants the highest return possible subject to the constraint that you limit his \nstandard deviation to be no more than 12%. Which client is more risk averse?  \n   22. Investment Management Inc. (IMI) uses the capital market line to make asset allocation recom-\nmendations. IMI derives the following forecasts: \n   \u2022 Expected return on the market portfolio: 12%.  \n   \u2022 Standard deviation on the market portfolio: 20%.     \u2022 Risk-free rate: 5%.    \n   Samuel Johnson seeks IMI\u2019s advice for a portfolio asset allocation. Johnson informs IMI that \nhe wants the standard deviation of the portfolio to equal half of the standard deviation for the market portfolio. Using the capital market line, what expected return can IMI provide subject to Johnson\u2019s risk constraint?    \n  For Problems 23 through 26:  Suppose that the borrowing rate that your client faces is \n9%. Assume that the S&P 500 index has an expected return of 13% and standard devia-\ntion of 25%, that  r  \n f  \u00a05\u00a05%, and that your fund has the parameters given in Problem 21. \n   23. Draw a diagram of your client\u2019s CML, accounting for the higher borrowing rate. Superimpose \non it two sets of indifference curves, one for a client who will choose to borrow, and one who \nwill invest in both the index fund and a money market fund.  \n   24.

The investor is taking on exchange rate risk by investing in a pound-denominated asset. If the \nexchange rate moves in the investor\u2019s favor, the investor will benefit and will earn more from \nthe U.K. bill than the U.S. bill. For example, if both the U.S. and U.K. interest rates are 5%, and the current exchange rate is $2 per pound, a $2 investment today can buy 1 pound, which can be invested in England at a certain rate of 5%, for a year-end value of 1.05 pounds. If the year-end exchange rate is $2.10 per pound, the 1.05 pounds can be exchanged for 1.05\u00a0 3 \u00a0$2.10\u00a0 5\u00a0$2.205 \nfor a rate of return in dollars of 1\u00a0 1\u00a0 r \u00a05\u00a0$2.205/$2\u00a0 5\u00a01.1025, or  r \u00a05\u00a010.25%, more than is \navailable from U.S. bills. Therefore, if the investor expects favorable exchange rate movements, the U.K. bill is a speculative investment. Otherwise, it is a gamble.  \n   2.

(Of course, a mixture of bills and the portfolio \nmight be even better, but that is not a choice here.) \n   Even for the  A \u00a05\u00a02 investor, the utility of the risky portfolio is   \nU5.202(\u00bd323.32)5.11  \n   while the utility of bills is again .07. The less risk-averse investor prefers the risky portfolio.  \n   3. The less risk-averse investor has a shallower indifference curve.

All investors whose degree of risk aversion is such that they would hold the risky portfolio in \na proportion equal to 100% or less ( y \u00a0\u2264\u00a01.00) are lending rather than borrowing, and so are \nunaffected by the borrowing rate. The least risk-averse of these investors hold 100% in the \nrisky portfolio ( y \u00a05\u00a01).

If all the investment parameters remain unchanged, the only reason for an investor to decrease the \ninvestment proportion in the risky asset is an increase in the degree of risk aversion. If you think \nthat this is unlikely, then you have to reconsider your faith in your assumptions. Perhaps the S&P \n500 is not a good proxy for the optimal risky portfolio. Perhaps investors expect a higher real rate \non T-bills.    \n  APPENDIX A:\u00a0  Risk Aversion, Expected Utility, and the St. Petersburg \nParadox \n  We digress in this appendix to examine the rationale behind our contention that investors \nare risk averse. Recognition of risk aversion as central in investment decisions goes back at \nleast to 1738. Daniel Bernoulli, one of a famous Swiss family of distinguished mathemati-\ncians, spent the years 1725 through 1733 in St. Petersburg, where he analyzed the follow-\ning coin-toss game. To enter the game one pays an entry fee. Thereafter, a coin is tossed \nuntil the  first  head appears. The number of tails, denoted by  n,  that appears until the first \nhead is tossed is used to compute the payoff, $ R,  to the participant, as   \nR(n)52n  \n The probability of no tails before the first head ( n \u00a05\u00a00) is 1/2 and the corresponding payoff is \n2 0 \u00a05\u00a0$1. The probability of one tail and then heads ( n \u00a05\u00a01) is 1/2\u00a0 3 \u00a01/2 with payoff 2 1 \u00a05\u00a0$2, \nthe probability of two tails and then heads ( n \u00a05\u00a02) is 1/2\u00a0 3 \u00a01/2\u00a0 3 \u00a01/2, and so forth. \n The following table illustrates the probabilities and payoffs for various outcomes: \nTails Probability Payoff\u00a0 5\u00a0$\u00a0R(n) Probability\u00a0 3\u00a0\u00a0Payoff\n0 1/2 $1 $1/2\n1 1/4 $2 $1/2\n2 1/8 $4 $1/2\n3 1/16 $8 $1/2\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nn (1/2)n\u00a01\u00a01   $ 2n$1/2\n The expected payoff is therefore   \nE(R)5a`\nn50Pr(n)R(n)51@211@21c5`   \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   199bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   199 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm200 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n The evaluation of this game is called the \u201cSt. Petersburg Paradox.\u201d Although the expected \npayoff is infinite, participants obviously will be willing to purchase tickets to play the game only at a finite, and possibly quite modest, entry fee. \n Bernoulli resolved the paradox by noting that investors do not assign the same value \nper dollar to all payoffs. Specifically, the greater their wealth, the less their \u201capprecia-tion\u201d for each extra dollar. We can make this insight mathematically precise by assigning a welfare or utility value to any level of investor wealth. Our utility function should increase as wealth is higher, but each extra dollar of wealth should increase utility by progres-sively smaller amounts.  \n9   (Modern economists would say that investors exhibit \u201cdecreasing \nmarginal utility\u201d from an additional payoff dollar.) One particular function that assigns a subjective value to the investor from a payoff of $ R,  which has a smaller value per dollar \nthe greater the payoff, is the function ln( R ) where ln is the natural logarithm function. If \nthis function measures utility values of wealth, the subjective utility value of the game is indeed finite, equal to .693.  \n10   The certain wealth level necessary to yield this utility value \nis $2.00, because ln(2.00)\u00a0 5\u00a0 .693. Hence the certainty equivalent value of the risky \npayoff is $2.00, which is the maximum amount that this investor will pay to play the game.  \n V on Neumann and Morgenstern adapted this approach to investment theory in a com-\nplete axiomatic system in 1946. Avoiding unnecessary technical detail, we restrict our-selves here to an intuitive exposition of the rationale for risk aversion. \n Imagine two individuals who are identical twins, except that one of them is less fortunate \nthan the other. Peter has only $1,000 to his name while Paul has a net worth of $200,000. How many hours of work would each twin be willing to offer to earn one extra dollar? It is likely that Peter (the poor twin) has more essential uses for the extra money than does Paul. Therefore, Peter will offer more hours. In other words, Peter derives a greater personal wel-fare or assigns a greater \u201cutility\u201d value to the 1,001st dollar than Paul does to the 200,001st.  Figure\u00a06A.1  depicts graphically the relationship between the wealth and the utility value of wealth that is consistent with this notion of decreasing marginal utility. \n  Individuals have different rates of decrease in their marginal utility of wealth. What \nis constant is the  principle  that the per-dollar increment to utility decreases with wealth. \nFunctions that exhibit the property of decreasing per-unit value as the number of units grows are called concave. A simple example is the log function, familiar from high school mathematics. Of course, a log function will not fit all investors, but it is consistent with the risk aversion that we assume for all investors. \n Now consider the following simple prospect: \n$100,000$150,000\n$50,000p\u00a05\u00a0\u00bd\n1\u00a02\u00a0p\u00a05\u00a0\u00bd\n This is a fair game in that the expected profit is zero. Suppose, however, that the curve \nin  Figure\u00a06A.1  represents the investor\u2019s utility value of wealth, assuming a log utility func-\ntion.  Figure\u00a06A.2  shows this curve with numerical values marked. \n   Figure\u00a06A.2  shows that the loss in utility from losing $50,000 exceeds the gain from win-\nning $50,000. Consider the gain first. With probability  p \u00a05\u00a0.5, wealth goes from $100,000 \n   9 This utility is similar in spirit to the one that assigns a satisfaction level to portfolios with given risk and return \nattributes. However, the utility function here refers not to investors\u2019 satisfaction with alternative portfolio choices \nbut only to the subjective welfare they derive from different levels of wealth.  \n  10 If we substitute the \u201cutility\u201d value, ln( R ), for the dollar payoff,  R,  to obtain an expected utility value of the game \n(rather than expected dollar value), we have, calling  V ( R ) the expected utility,   \nV(R)5a`\nn50Pr(n) ln3R(n)45a`\nn50(1/2)n11 ln(2n)5.693  \nbod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   200bod61671_ch06_168-204.indd   200 6/18/13   8:08 PM6/18/13   8:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 6 Capital Allocation to Risky Assets  201\nto $150,000.

You buy a $200,000 house and invest the remainder in a \nrisk-free asset paying an annual interest rate of 6%. There is a probability of .001 that your house \nwill burn to the ground and its value will be reduced to zero. With a log utility of end-of-year wealth, how much would you be willing to pay for insurance (at the beginning of the year)? (Assume that if the house does not burn down, its end-of-year value still will be $200,000.)  \n   2.

Essentially, a dollar in bad times (when wealth is low) is more valuable than a dollar in good times (when wealth is high). \n Suppose that all investors hold the risky S&P 500 portfolio. Then, if the portfolio value \nfalls in a worse-than-expected economy, all investors will, albeit to different degrees, expe-rience a \u201clow-wealth\u201d scenario. Therefore, the equilibrium value of a dollar in the low-wealth economy would be higher than the value of a dollar when the portfolio performs better than expected. This observation helps explain the apparently high cost of portfolio insurance that we encountered when considering long-term investments in the previous chapter. It also helps explain why an investment in a stock portfolio (and hence in individ-ual stocks) has a risk premium that appears to be so high and results in probability of short-fall that is so low. Despite the low probability of shortfall risk, stocks still do not dominate the lower-return risk-free bond, because if an investment shortfall should transpire, it will coincide with states in which the value of dollar returns is high. \n Does revealed behavior of investors demonstrate risk aversion? Looking at prices \nand past rates of return in financial markets, we can answer with a resounding yes. With remarkable consistency, riskier bonds are sold at lower prices than are safer ones with otherwise similar characteristics. Riskier stocks also have provided higher average rates of return over long periods of time than less risky assets such as T-bills. For example, over the 1926 to 2012 period, the average rate of return on the S&P 500 portfolio exceeded the T-bill return by around 8% per year. \n It is abundantly clear from financial data that the average, or representative, investor \nexhibits substantial risk aversion. For readers who recognize that financial assets are priced to compensate for risk by providing a risk premium and at the same time feel the urge for some gambling, we have a constructive recommendation: Direct your gambling impulse to investment in financial markets. As V on Neumann once said, \u201cThe stock market is a casino with the odds in your favor.\u201d A small risk-seeking investment may provide all the excite-ment you want with a positive expected return to boot!   \nAPPENDIX C:\u00a0The Kelly Criterion\nTo take a step upwards from the gamble of the St. Petersburg Paradox, consider a sequence of identical one-period investment prospects, each with two possible payoffs (with rates of return expressed as decimals): a positive excess return, b, with prob-\nability p, and a negative excess return, 2 a (a . 0), with probability q 5 1 2  p. J.L. \nKelly\n11 considered this a basic form of a capital allocation problem and determined the \noptimal investment in such a sequence of bets for an investor with a log utility function (described in Appendix A).\nInvesting a fraction y in the prospect and the remainder in the risk-free asset provides \na total rate of return of 1 1 r 1 by with probability p, or 1 1 r \u2013 ay with probability q. \nBecause Kelly employs a log utility function, the expected utility of the prospect, per dol-lar of initial wealth, is:\n E3U(y)45p ln(11r1yb)1q ln(11r2ay) (6.C.1)\n11J.L.

The criterion states that the fraction of total wealth invested in the risky prospect is independent of wealth and is given by:\n y5(11r)\nap\na2q\nbb (6.C.2)\nThis will be the investor\u2019s asset allocation in each period.\nThe Kelly formula calls for investing more in the prospect when p and b are large and \nless when q and a are large. Risk aversion stands out since, when the gains and losses are \nequal, i.e., when a 5 b, y 5 (1 1 r)(p 2 q)/a, the larger the win/loss spread (correspond-\ning to larger values of a and b), the smaller the fraction invested. A higher interest rate also increases risk taking (an income effect). \nKelly\u2019s rule is based on the log utility function. One can show that investors who have \nsuch a utility function will, in each period, attempt to maximize the geometric mean of the portfolio return. So the Kelly formula also is a rule to maximize geometric mean, and it has several interesting properties: (1) It never risks ruin, since the fraction of wealth in the risky asset in Equation 6C.2 never exceeds 1/a. (2) The probability that it will outperform any other strategy goes to 1 as the investment horizon goes to infinity. (3) It is myopic, meaning the optimal strategy is the same regardless of the investment horizon. (4) If you have a specified wealth goal (e.g., $1 million), the strategy has the shortest expected time to that goal. Considerable literature has been devoted to the Kelly criterion.\n12\n12See, for example, L.C. MacLean, E.O. Thorp, W.T.

In principle, asset allocation and security selection are technically identical; both aim at identifying that optimal risky portfolio, namely, the combination of risky assets that provides the best risk\u2013return trade-off. In practice, however, asset allocation and secu-rity selection are typically separated into two steps, in which the broad outlines of the port-folio are established first (asset allocation), while details concerning specific securities are filled in later (security selection). After we show how the optimal risky portfolio may be constructed, we will consider the costs and benefits of pursuing this two-step approach. \n We first motivate the discussion by illustrat-\ning the potential gains from simple diversifi-\ncation into many assets. We then proceed to examine the process of  efficient  diversification \nfrom the ground up, starting with an invest-ment menu of only two risky assets, then adding the risk-free asset, and finally, incor-porating the entire universe of available risky securities. We learn how diversification can reduce risk without affecting expected returns. This accomplished, we re-examine the hierar-chy of capital allocation, asset allocation, and security selection. Finally, we offer insight into the power of diversification by drawing an analogy between it and the workings of the insurance industry. \n The portfolios we discuss in this and the fol-\nlowing chapters are of a short-term-horizon\u2014\neven if the overall investment horizon is long, portfolio composition can be rebalanced or updated almost continuously. For these short horizons, the assumption of normality is suf-ficiently accurate to describe holding-period returns, and we will be concerned only with portfolio means and variances. \n In Appendix A, we demonstrate how con-\nstruction of the optimal risky portfolio can \neasily be accomplished with Excel. Appendix\u00a0B provides a review of portfolio statistics with emphasis on the intuition behind covariance and correlation measures.

What would be the \nsources of risk to this \u201cportfolio\u201d? You might think of two broad sources of uncertainty. First, there is the risk that comes from conditions in the general economy, such as the business cycle, inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates. None of these macroeconomic factors can be predicted with certainty, and all affect the rate of return on Dell stock. In addition to these macroeconomic factors there are firm-specific influences, such as Dell\u2019s success in research and development, and personnel changes. These factors affect Dell without noticeably affecting other firms in the economy. \n Now consider a naive    diversification    strategy, in which you include additional securi-\nties in your portfolio. For example, place half your funds in ExxonMobil and half in Dell. What should happen to portfolio risk? To the extent that the firm-specific influences on the two stocks differ, diversification should reduce portfolio risk. For example, when oil prices fall, hurting ExxonMobil, computer prices might rise, helping Dell. The two effects are offsetting and stabilize portfolio return. \n But why end diversification at only two stocks? If we diversify into many more \nsecurities, we continue to spread out our exposure to firm-specific factors, and portfo-lio volatility should continue to fall. Ultimately, however, even with a large number of stocks we cannot avoid risk altogether, because virtually all securities are affected by the common macroeconomic factors. For example, if all stocks are affected by the busi-ness cycle, we cannot avoid exposure to business cycle risk no matter how many stocks we hold. \n When all risk is firm-specific, as in  Figure\u00a07.1 , panel A, diversification can reduce risk \nto arbitrarily low levels. The reason is that with all risk sources independent, the exposure to any particular source of risk is reduced to a negligible level. The reduction of risk to very low levels in the case of independent risk sources is sometimes called the    insurance \nprinciple,    because of the notion that an insurance company depends on the risk reduction achieved through diversification when it writes many policies insuring against many inde-pendent sources of risk, each policy being a small part of the company\u2019s overall portfolio. (See Section 7.5 for a discussion of the insurance principle.) \n \n    When common sources of risk affect all firms, however, even extensive diversifica-\ntion cannot eliminate risk. In  Figure\u00a07.1 , panel B, portfolio standard deviation falls as the number of securities increases, but it cannot be reduced to zero. The risk that remains even after extensive diversification is called    market risk,    risk that is attributable to marketwide \nrisk sources. Such risk is also called    systematic risk,    or    nondiversifiable risk   . In contrast, \nthe risk that  can  be eliminated by diversification is called    unique risk   ,    firm-specific risk   , \n   nonsystematic risk   , or    diversifiable risk   . \n This analysis is borne out by empirical studies.  Figure\u00a07.2  shows the effect of portfolio \ndiversification, using data on NYSE stocks.  \n1   The figure shows the average standard devia-\ntion of equally weighted portfolios constructed by selecting stocks at random as a function \nof the number of stocks in the portfolio. On average, portfolio risk does fall with diversifi-cation, but the power of diversification to reduce risk is limited by systematic or common sources of risk.\n      \n  1 Meir Statman, \u201cHow Many Stocks Make a Diversified Portfolio?\u201d  Journal of Financial and Quantitative \n Analysis  22 (September 1987). \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   206bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   206 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios 207\nAverage Portfolio Standard Deviation (%)50\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1,0000100\n75\n50\n40\nRisk Compared to a One-Stock Portfolio (%)Number of Stocks in Portfolio4045\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n Figure 7.2 Portfolio diversification.

It is time now to study  efficient  diversification, whereby we construct \nrisky portfolios to provide the lowest possible risk for any given level of expected return. \n Portfolios of two risky assets are relatively easy to analyze, and they illustrate the prin-\nciples and considerations that apply to portfolios of many assets. It makes sense to think about a two-asset portfolio as an asset allocation decision, and so we consider two mutual funds, a bond portfolio specializing in long-term debt securities, denoted  D,  and a stock \nfund that specializes in equity securities,  E.   Table\u00a07.1  lists the parameters describing the \nrate-of-return distribution of these funds.  \n A proportion denoted by  w  \n D   is invested in the bond fund, and the remainder, 1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 w   D  , \ndenoted  w   E  , is invested in the stock fund. The rate of return on this portfolio,  r   p  , will be  2      \n rp5wDrD1wErE  (7.1)  \nwhere  r   D   is the rate of return on the debt fund and  r   E   is the rate of return on the equity fund. \n The expected return on the portfolio is a weighted average of expected returns on the \ncomponent securities with portfolio proportions as weights:   \n E(rp)5wDE(rD)1wEE(rE)  (7.2)   \n The variance of the two-asset portfolio is   \n sp25wD2sD21wE2sE212wDwE Cov (rD, rE)  (7.3)   \n Our first observation is that the variance of the portfolio, unlike the expected return, is \n not  a weighted average of the individual asset variances. To understand the formula for the \nportfolio variance more clearly, recall that the covariance of a variable with itself is the variance of that variable; that is   \n Cov (r\nD, rD)5a\nscenariosPr(scenario )3rD2E(rD)43rD2E(rD)4\n 5a\nscenariosPr(scenario )3rD2E(rD)42 (7.4)\n  5sD2    \nTherefore, another way to write the variance of the portfolio is   \n sp25wDwD Cov (rD, rD)1wEwE Cov (rE, rE)12wDwE Cov (rD, rE)  (7.5)     7.2 Portfolios of Two Risky Assets  \n    Debt        Equity  \n Expected return,  E ( r )   8%      13% \n Standard deviation,  s   12%      20% \n Covariance, Cov( r   D  , \u00a0r   E  )    72     \n Correlation coefficient,  r   DE        .30    Table 7.1 \n Descriptive statistics \nfor two mutual funds \n  2 See Appendix B of this chapter for a review of portfolio statistics. \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   208bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   208 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios 209\nIn words, the variance of the portfolio is a weighted sum of covariances, and each weight \nis the product of the portfolio proportions of the pair of assets in the covariance term. \n  Table\u00a07.2  shows how portfolio variance can be calculated from a spreadsheet. Panel A \nof the table shows the  bordered   covariance matrix of the returns of the two mutual funds. \nThe bordered matrix is the covariance matrix with the portfolio weights for each fund \nplaced on the borders, that is, along the first row and column. To find portfolio variance, \nmultiply each element in the covariance matrix by the pair of portfolio weights in its row \nand column borders. Add up the resultant terms, and you have the formula for portfolio \nvariance given in Equation 7.5.  \n We perform these calculations in panel B, which is the  border-multiplied   covariance \nmatrix: Each covariance has been multiplied by the weights from the row and the column \nin the borders. The bottom line of panel B confirms that the sum of all the terms in this \nmatrix (which we obtain by adding up the column sums) is indeed the portfolio variance \nin Equation 7.5. \n This procedure works because the covariance matrix is symmetric around the diagonal, \nthat is, Cov( r   D  ,\u00a0 r   E  )\u00a0 5 \u00a0Cov( r   E  ,\u00a0 r   D  ). Thus each covariance term appears twice. \n This technique for computing the variance from the border-multiplied covariance matrix \nis general; it applies to any number of assets and is easily implemented on a spreadsheet. \nConcept Check 1 asks you to try the rule for a three-asset portfolio. Use this problem to \nverify that you are comfortable with this concept.  \nA.

It is \nimportant to recognize that even if the covariance term is positive, the portfolio standard \ndeviation  still  is less than the weighted average of the individual security standard devia-\ntions, unless the two securities are perfectly positively correlated. \n To see this, notice that the covariance can be computed from the correlation coefficient, \n r   DE  , as   \n Cov(r D, rE) 5 r DE sDsE  (7.6)  \nTherefore,   \n sp25wD2sD21wE2sE212wDwEsDsErDE  (7.7)  \nOther things equal, portfolio variance is higher when  r   DE   is higher. In the case of perfect \npositive correlation,  r   DE  \u00a0 5 \u00a01, the right-hand side of Equation 7.7 is a perfect square and \nsimplifies to   \n sp25(wDsD1wEsE)2  (7.8)  \nor    s\np5wDsD1wEsE  (7.9)  \nTherefore, the standard deviation of the portfolio with perfect positive correlation is just \nthe weighted average of the component standard deviations. In all other cases, the cor-relation coefficient is less than 1, making the portfolio standard deviation  less  than the \nweighted average of the component standard deviations. \n A hedge asset has  negative  correlation with the other assets in the portfolio. Equation \n7.7 shows that such assets will be particularly effective in reducing total risk. Moreover, Equation 7.2 shows that expected return is unaffected by correlation between returns. Therefore, other things equal, we will always prefer to add to our portfolios assets with low or, even better, negative correlation with our existing position. \n Because the portfolio\u2019s expected return is the weighted average of its component \nexpected returns, whereas its standard deviation is less than the weighted average of the component standard deviations,  portfolios of less than perfectly correlated assets always \noffer some degree of diversification benefit.  The lower the correlation between the assets, the greater the gain in efficiency. \n How low can portfolio standard deviation be? The lowest possible value of the correla-\ntion coefficient is  2 1, representing perfect negative correlation. In this case, Equation 7.7 \nsimplifies to   \n s\np25(wDsD2wEsE)2  (7.10)  \nand the portfolio standard deviation is    s\np5Absolute value (wDsD2wEsE)  (7.11)  \nWhen  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 1, a perfectly hedged position can be obtained by choosing the portfolio pro-\nportions to solve   \nwDsD2wEsE50 \nThe solution to this equation is   \nwD5sE\nsD1sE\n wE5sD\nsD1sE512wD  (7.12)\n   \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   210bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   210 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios 211\n These weights drive the standard deviation of the portfolio to zero.  \n We can experiment with different portfolio proportions to observe the effect on portfo-\nlio expected return and variance. Suppose we change the proportion invested in bonds. The \neffect on expected return is tabulated in  Table\u00a07.3  and plotted in  Figure\u00a07.3 . When the pro-\nportion invested in debt varies from zero to 1 (so that the proportion in equity varies from \n1 to zero), the portfolio expected return goes from 13% (the stock fund\u2019s expected return) \nto 8% (the expected return on bonds).   \n What happens when  w   D  \u00a0.\u00a01 and  w   E  \u00a0,\u00a00? In this case portfolio strategy would be to sell \nthe equity fund short and invest the proceeds of the short sale in the debt fund. This will \ndecrease the expected return of the portfolio. For example, when  w   D  \u00a0 5 \u00a02 and  w   E  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 1, \nexpected portfolio return falls to 2\u00a0 3 \u00a08\u00a0 1 \u00a0( 2 1)\u00a0 3 \u00a013\u00a0 5 \u00a03%. At this point the value of the \nbond fund in the portfolio is twice the net worth of the account. This extreme position is \nfinanced in part by short-selling stocks equal in value to the portfolio\u2019s net worth. \n Table 7.3 \n Expected return \nand standard \ndeviation with \nvarious correla-\ntion coefficients Portfolio Standard Deviation for Given Correlation\nwD wE E(rP) r 5 21 r 5 0 r 5 .30 r 5 1\n0.00 1.00 13.00 20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00\n0.10 0.90 12.50 16.80 18.04 18.40 19.20\n0.20 0.80 12.00 13.60 16.18 16.88 18.40\n0.30 0.70 11.50 10.40 14.46 15.47 17.60\n0.40 0.60 11.00  7.20 12.92 14.20 16.80\n0.50 0.50 10.50  4.00 11.66 13.11 16.00\n0.60 0.40 10.00  0.80 10.76 12.26 15.20\n0.70 0.30  9.50  2.40 10.32 11.70 14.40\n0.80 0.20  9.00  5.60 10.40 11.45 13.60\n0.90 0.10  8.50  8.80 10.98 11.56 12.80\n1.00 0.00  8.00 12.00 12.00 12.00 12.00\nMinimum Variance Portfolio\nwD 0.6250  0.7353  0.8200 \u2014\nwE 0.3750  0.2647  0.1800 \u2014\nE(rP) 9.8750  9.3235  8.9000 \u2014\nsP 0.0000 10.2899 11.4473 \u2014 Let us apply this analysis to the data of the bond and stock funds as presented in \n Table\u00a07.1 .

Even in this case, however, there is a positive (if small) benefit from diversification.\n   \n What is the minimum level to which portfolio standard deviation can be held? For the \nparameter values stipulated in  Table\u00a07.1 , the portfolio weights that solve this minimization problem turn out to be  \n4     \nwMin(D) 5 .82\nwMin(E) 5 1 2 .82 5 .18 \nThis minimum-variance portfolio has a standard deviation of   \nsMin53(.8223122)1(.1823202)1(23.823.18372)41/2511.45% \nas indicated in the last line of  Table\u00a07.3  for the column  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.30. \n The solid colored line in  Figure\u00a07.4  plots the portfolio standard deviation when  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.30 \nas a function of the investment proportions. It passes through the two undiversified port-folios of  w  \n D  \u00a0 5 \u00a01 and  w   E  \u00a0 5 \u00a01. Note that the    minimum-variance portfolio    has a standard \ndeviation  smaller than that of either of the individual component assets.  This illustrates the \neffect of diversification. \n The other three lines in  Figure\u00a07.4  show how portfolio risk varies for other values of the \ncorrelation coefficient, holding the variances of each asset constant. These lines plot the \nvalues in the other three columns of  Table\u00a07.3 . \n The solid dark straight line connecting the undiversified portfolios of all bonds or all \nstocks,  w   D  \u00a0 5 \u00a01 or  w   E  \u00a0 5 \u00a01, shows portfolio standard deviation with perfect positive cor-\nrelation,  r \u00a0 5 \u00a01. In this case there is no advantage from diversification, and the portfo-\nlio standard deviation is the simple weighted average of the component asset standard \ndeviations. \n The dashed colored curve depicts portfolio risk for the case of uncorrelated assets, \n r \u00a0 5 \u00a00. With lower correlation between the two assets, diversification is more effective and \nportfolio risk is lower (at least when both assets are held in positive amounts). The mini-mum portfolio standard deviation when  r \u00a0 5 \u00a00 is 10.29% (see  Table\u00a07.3 ),  again lower than \nthe standard deviation of either asset.  \n Finally, the triangular broken line illustrates the perfect hedge potential when the two \nassets are perfectly negatively correlated ( r \u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 1). In this case the solution for the mini-\nmum-variance portfolio is, by Equation 7.12,   \nw\nMin(D; r52 1)5sE\nsD1sE520\n121205.625\nwMin(E; r 5 21) 5 1 2 .625 5 .375 \nand the portfolio variance (and standard deviation) is zero. \n We can combine  Figures\u00a07.3  and  7.4  to demonstrate the relationship between portfolio \nrisk (standard deviation) and expected return\u2014given the parameters of the available assets. \n   4 This solution uses the minimization techniques of calculus.

The resulting pairs of expected \nreturn and standard deviation are tabulated in \n Table\u00a07.3  and plotted in  Figure\u00a07.5 . \n  The solid colored curve in  Figure\u00a07.5  shows the \n   portfolio opportunity set    for  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0 .30. We call it \nthe portfolio opportunity set because it shows all \ncombinations of portfolio expected return and stan-\ndard deviation that can be constructed from the two \navailable assets. The other lines show the portfolio \nopportunity set for other values of the correlation \ncoefficient. The solid black line connecting the two \nfunds shows that there is no benefit from diversifi-\ncation when the correlation between the two is per-\nfectly positive ( r \u00a0 5 \u00a0 1). The opportunity set is not \n\u201cpushed\u201d to the northwest. The dashed colored line \ndemonstrates the greater benefit from diversification \nwhen the correlation coefficient is lower than .30. \n Finally, for  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 1, the portfolio opportunity \nset is linear, but now it offers a perfect hedging \nopportunity and the maximum advantage from \ndiversification. \n To summarize, although the expected return of \nany portfolio is simply the weighted average of the asset expected returns, this is not true \nof the standard deviation. Potential benefits from diversification arise when correlation is \nless than perfectly positive. The lower the correlation, the greater the potential benefit from \ndiversification. In the extreme case of perfect negative correlation, we have a perfect hedg-\ning opportunity and can construct a zero-variance portfolio. \n Suppose now an investor wishes to select the optimal portfolio from the opportunity set. \nThe best portfolio will depend on risk aversion. Portfolios to the northeast in  Figure\u00a07.5  \nprovide higher rates of return but impose greater risk. \nThe best trade-off among these choices is a matter of per-\nsonal preference. Investors with greater risk aversion will \nprefer portfolios to the southwest, with lower expected \nreturn but lower risk.  5       \n5 Given a level of risk aversion, one can determine the portfolio that provides the highest level of utility. Recall \nfrom Chapter 6 that we were able to describe the utility provided by a portfolio as a function of its expected return, \nE ( r   p  ), and its variance,    sp2,  according to the relationship    U5E(rp)20.5Asp2.  The portfolio mean and variance are \ndetermined by the portfolio weights in the two funds,  w   E   and  w   D  , according to Equations 7.2 and 7.3. Using those \nequations and some calculus, we find the optimal investment proportions in the two funds.

The steeper the CAL, the greater is the expected \nreturn corresponding to any level of volatility. Now we proceed to asset allocation: con-\nstructing the risky portfolio of major asset classes, here a bond and a stock fund, with the \nhighest possible Sharpe ratio. \n The asset allocation decision requires that we consider T-bills or another safe asset \nalong with the risky asset classes. The reason is that the Sharpe ratio we seek to maximize \nis defined as the risk premium in  excess of the risk-free rate,   divided by the standard devia-\ntion. We use T-bill rates as the risk-free rate in evaluating the Sharpe ratios of all possible \nportfolios. The portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio is the solution to the asset alloca-\ntion problem. Using only stocks, bonds, and bills is actually not so restrictive, as it includes \nall three major asset classes. As the nearby box emphasizes, most investment professionals \nrecognize that \u201cthe really critical decision is how to divvy up your money among stocks, \nbonds, and super-safe investments such as Treasury bills.\u201d\n     Asset Allocation with Two Risky Asset Classes \n What if our risky assets are still confined to the bond and stock funds, but we can also \ninvest in risk-free T-bills yielding 5%? We start with a graphical solution.  Figure\u00a07.6  shows \nthe opportunity set based on the properties of the bond and stock funds, using the data \nfrom  Table\u00a07.1  and assuming that r 5 .3. \n  Two possible capital allocation lines (CALs) are drawn from the risk-free rate ( r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a05%) \nto two feasible portfolios. The first possible CAL is drawn through the minimum-variance \nportfolio  A,  which is invested 82% in bonds and 18% in stocks ( Table\u00a07.3 , bottom panel, \nlast column). Portfolio  A \u2019s expected return is 8.90%, and its standard deviation is 11.45%. \nWith a T-bill rate of 5%, its    Sharpe ratio,    \nwhich is the slope of the CAL, is   \nSA5E(rA)2rf\nsA58.925\n11.455.34  \n Now consider the CAL that uses portfolio  B  \ninstead of  A.  Portfolio  B  invests 70% in bonds \nand 30% in stocks. Its expected return is 9.5% \n(a risk premium of 4.5%), and its standard devi-\nation is 11.70%. Thus the Sharpe ratio on the \nCAL supported by portfolio  B  is   \nSB59.525\n11.75.38 \nwhich is higher than the Sharpe ratio of the \nCAL using the minimum-variance portfolio and \nT-bills. Hence, portfolio  B  dominates  A.  \n But why stop at portfolio  B?  We can con-\ntinue to ratchet the CAL upward until it ulti-\nmately reaches the point of tangency with the \ninvestment opportunity set. This must yield the \nCAL with the highest feasible Sharpe ratio. \nTherefore, the tangency portfolio, labeled  P  in    7.3 Asset Allocation with Stocks, Bonds, and Bills  \n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\nStandard Deviation (%)0 5 10 15 20 25Expected Return (%)\nDE\nABCAL( A)\nCAL( B)\n Figure 7.6 The opportunity set of the debt and equity \nfunds and two feasible CALs  \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   215bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   215 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n Recipe for Successful Investing: First, Mix Assets Well \n First things first. \n If you want dazzling investment results, don\u2019t start \nyour day foraging for hot stocks and stellar mutual funds. \nInstead, say investment advisers, the really critical decision is how to divvy up your money among stocks, bonds, and supersafe investments such as Treasury bills. \n In Wall Street lingo, this mix of investments is called \nyour asset allocation. \u201cThe asset-allocation choice is the \nfirst and most important decision,\u201d says William Droms, a finance professor at Georgetown University. \u201cHow much you have in [the stock market] really drives your results.\u201d \n \u201cYou cannot get [stock market] returns from a bond \nportfolio, no matter how good your security selection is \nor how good the bond managers you use,\u201d says William John Mikus, a managing director of Financial Design, a Los Angeles investment adviser. \n For proof, Mr. Mikus cites studies such as the 1991 anal-\nysis done by Gary Brinson, Brian Singer and Gilbert Bee-\nbower. That study, which looked at the 10-year results for 82 large pension plans, found that a plan\u2019s asset-allocation policy explained 91.5% of the return earned. \n  DESIGNING A PORTFOLIO \n Because your asset mix is so important, some mutual fund \ncompanies now offer free services to help investors design their portfolios. \n Gerald Perritt, editor of the  Mutual Fund Letter,  a \n Chicago newsletter, says you should vary your mix of assets \ndepending on how long you plan to invest. The further away your investment horizon, the more you should have in stocks. The closer you get, the more you should lean toward bonds and money-market instruments, such as Treasury bills. Bonds and money-market instruments may generate lower returns than stocks. But for those who need money in the near future, conservative investments make more sense, because there\u2019s less chance of suffering a devastating short-term loss.  \n  SUMMARIZING YOUR ASSETS \n \u201cOne of the most important things people can do is sum-\nmarize all their assets on one piece of paper and figure out their asset allocation,\u201d says Mr. Pond. \n Once you\u2019ve settled on a mix of stocks and bonds, \nyou should seek to maintain the target percentages, says \nMr. Pond. To do that, he advises figuring out your asset allocation once every six months. Because of a stock- market \nplunge, you could find that stocks are now a far smaller part of your portfolio than you envisaged. At such a time, you should put more into stocks and lighten up on bonds. \n When devising portfolios, some investment advisers \nconsider gold and real estate in addition to the usual trio \nof stocks, bonds and money-market instruments. Gold and real estate give \u201cyou a hedge against hyperinflation,\u201d says Mr. Droms.  \n  Source:  Jonathan Clements, \u201cRecipe for Successful Investing: \nFirst, Mix Assets Well,\u201d  The Wall Street Journal,  October 6, 1993. \nReprinted by permission of  The Wall Street Journal,  \u00a9 1993 Dow \nJones & Company, Inc.

To start, however, we will demonstrate the solution of the portfolio construction problem with only two risky assets and a risk-free asset. In this simpler case, we can find an explicit formula for the weights of each asset in the optimal portfolio, mak-ing it easier to illustrate general issues. \n The objective is to find the weights  w  \n D   and  w   E   that result in the highest slope of the \nCAL.

Now that we have \nconstructed the optimal risky portfolio,  P,  we can use the individual investor\u2019s degree of \nrisk aversion,  A,  to calculate the optimal proportion of the complete portfolio to invest in \nthe risky component.

Notice that this slope exceeds the slope of any \nof the other feasible portfolios that we have considered, as it must if it is to be the slope \nof the best feasible CAL. \n  7 Notice that we express returns as decimals in Equation 7.14. This is necessary when using the risk aversion \nparameter,  A,  to solve for capital allocation.  Now that asset allocation is decided, we can find each investor\u2019s optimal capital allo-\ncation.

Example 7.3 The Optimal Complete Portfolio \n Once we have reached this point, generalizing to the case of many risky assets is \nstraightforward. Before we move on, let us briefly summarize the steps we followed to \narrive at the complete portfolio. \n    1.

Calculate the fraction of the complete portfolio allocated to portfolio  P  (the risky \nportfolio) and to T-bills (the risk-free asset) (Equation 7.14).  \n    b.   Calculate the share of the complete portfolio invested in each asset and in T-bills.      \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   218bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   218 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios 219\n Recall that our two risky assets, the bond and stock mutual funds, are already diversified \nportfolios. The diversification  within   each of these portfolios must be credited for a good deal \nof the risk reduction compared to undiversified single securities. For example, the standard \ndeviation of the rate of return on an average stock is about 50% (see  Figure\u00a07.2 ). In contrast, \nthe standard deviation of our stock-index fund is only 20%, about equal to the historical \nstandard deviation of the S&P 500 portfolio. This is evidence of the importance of diver-\nsification within the asset class. Optimizing the asset allocation between bonds and stocks \ncontributed incrementally to the improvement in the Sharpe ratio of the complete portfolio. \nThe CAL using the optimal combination of stocks and bonds (see  Figure\u00a07.8 ) shows that one \ncan achieve an expected return of 13% (matching that of the stock portfolio) with a standard \ndeviation of 18%, which is less than the 20% standard deviation of the stock portfolio.       \nPortfolio P\n74.39%\nStocks\n44.63%Bonds\n29.76%\nT-bills\n25.61%\n Figure 7.9 The proportions of the \noptimal complete portfolio  \nStandard Deviation (%)0 5 10 15 20 25 30Expected Return (%)\nDCE\nPCAL( P)\nOpportunity\nSet of Risky\nAssets\nOptimal Risky\nPortfolioIndifference Curve\nOptimal\nComplete\nPortfolio2\n04681012141618\nrf = 5%\n Figure 7.8 Determination of the optimal complete portfolio  \n The universe of available securities includes two risky stock funds,  A  and  B,  and T-bills.

For example, the security with the high-\nest expected return must lie on the frontier, as that security represents the  only  way that one can obtain a return \nthat high, and so it must also be the minimum-variance way to obtain that return. When short sales are feasible, \nhowever, portfolios can be constructed that offer the same expected return and lower variance. These portfolios \ntypically will have short positions in low-expected-return securities. Security Selection \n We can generalize the portfolio con-\nstruction problem to the case of many \nrisky securities and a risk-free asset. \nAs in the two risky assets example, \nthe problem has three parts. First, \nwe identify the risk\u2013return combina-\ntions available from the set of risky \nassets. Next, we identify the optimal \nportfolio of risky assets by finding \nthe portfolio weights that result in \nthe steepest CAL. Finally, we choose \nan appropriate complete portfolio \nby mixing the risk-free asset with \nthe optimal risky portfolio. Before \ndescribing the process in detail, let \nus first present an overview. \n The first step is to determine the \nrisk\u2013return opportunities available to \nthe investor. These are summarized \nby the    minimum-variance fron tier    \nof risky assets. This frontier is a graph \nof the lowest possible variance that can be attained for a given portfolio expected return. \nGiven the input data for expected returns, variances, and covariances, we can calculate the \nminimum-variance portfolio for any targeted expected return. The plot of these expected \nreturn\u2013standard deviation pairs is presented in  Figure\u00a07.10 . \n  Notice that all the individual assets lie to the right inside the frontier, at least when we \nallow short sales in the construction of risky portfolios.  8   This tells us that risky portfolios \ncomprising only a single asset are inefficient. Diversifying investments leads to portfolios \nwith higher expected returns and lower standard deviations.  \n All the portfolios that lie on the minimum-variance frontier from the global minimum- \nvariance portfolio and upward provide the best risk\u2013return combinations and thus are \ncandidates for the optimal portfolio. The part of the frontier that lies above the global \nminimum-variance portfolio, therefore, is called the    efficient frontier of risky assets.    For \nany portfolio on the lower portion of the minimum-variance frontier, there is a portfolio \nwith the same standard deviation and a greater expected return positioned directly above it. \nHence the bottom part of the minimum-variance frontier is inefficient. \n The second part of the optimization plan involves the risk-free asset. As before, we \nsearch for the capital allocation line with the highest Sharpe ratio (that is, the steepest \nslope) as shown in  Figure\u00a07.11 .  \n The CAL that is supported by the optimal portfolio,  P,  is tangent to the efficient fron-\ntier. This CAL dominates all alternative feasible lines (the broken lines that are drawn \nthrough the frontier). Portfolio  P,  therefore, is the optimal risky portfolio.     7.4 The Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Model    \n Figure 7.10 The minimum-variance frontier of risky assets  \nE(r)\nMinimum-Variance FrontierIndividual\nAssetsGlobal\nMinimum-\nVariance\nPortfolioEf\ufb01cient Frontier\n\u03c3\nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   220bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   220 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\nE(r)\nCAL( P)\nEf\ufb01cient Frontier\nP\nrf\n\u03c3\n Figure 7.11 The efficient frontier of risky assets with the optimal CAL   eXcel APPLICATIONS: Two\u2013Security Model \n The accompanying spreadsheet can be used to mea-\nsure the return and risk of a portfolio of two risky \nassets.

In \nthe first part of the problem, risk\u2013return analysis, the portfolio manager needs as inputs \na set of estimates for the expected returns of each security and a set of estimates for the \ncovariance matrix. (In Part Five on security analysis we will examine the security valuation \ntechniques and methods of financial \nanalysis that analysts use. For now, \nwe will assume that analysts already \nhave spent the time and resources to \nprepare the inputs.) \n The portfolio manager is now \narmed with the  n  estimates of  E ( r   i  ) \nand the  n \u00a0 3 \u00a0 n  estimates of the covari-\nance matrix in which the  n  diagonal \nelements are estimates of the vari-\nances,    si2,  and the  n  2 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 n \u00a0 5 \u00a0 n ( n \u00a0 2 \u00a01) \noff-diagonal elements are the esti-\nmates of the covariances between \neach pair of asset returns. (You can \nverify this from  Table\u00a07.2  for the case \nn \u00a0 5 \u00a02.) We know that each covariance \nappears twice in this table, so actually \nwe have  n ( n \u00a0 2 \u00a01)/2  different covari-\nance estimates. If our portfolio man-\nagement unit covers 50  securities, \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   221bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   221 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2 2 2 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nour security analysts need to deliver 50 estimates of expected returns, 50 estimates \nof variances, and 50\u00a0 3 \u00a049/2\u00a0 5 \u00a01,225 different estimates of covariances. This is a daunting \ntask! (We show later how the number of required estimates can be reduced substantially.) \n Once these estimates are compiled, the expected return and variance of any risky port-\nfolio with weights in each security,  w   i  , can be calculated from the bordered covariance \nmatrix or, equivalently, from the following extensions of Equations 7.2 and 7.3:   \nE(rp)5an\ni51wiE(ri)  (7.15)     \nsp25an\ni51an\nj51wiwj Cov (ri, rj)  (7.16)  \nAn extended worked example showing how to do this using a spreadsheet is presented in \nAppendix A of this chapter. \n We mentioned earlier that the idea of diversification is age-old. The phrase \u201cdon\u2019t put all \nyour eggs in one basket\u201d existed long before modern finance theory. It was not until 1952, \nhowever, that Harry Markowitz published a formal model of portfolio selection embodying \ndiversification principles, thereby paving the way for his 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics.  9\nHis model is precisely step one of portfolio management: the identification of the efficient \nset of portfolios, or the  efficient frontier of risky assets.    \n The principal idea behind the frontier set of risky portfolios is that, for any risk level, \nwe are interested only in that portfolio with the highest expected return. Alternatively, the \nfrontier is the set of portfolios that minimizes the variance for any target expected return. \n Indeed, the two methods of computing the efficient set of risky portfolios are equiva-\nlent. To see this, consider the graphical representation of these procedures.

We \nfirst draw the constraints, that is, horizontal lines at the level of required expected returns. \nWe then look for the portfolio with the lowest standard deviation that plots on each hori-zontal line\u2014we look for the portfolio that will plot farthest to the left (smallest standard deviation) on that line. When we repeat this for many levels of required expected returns, the shape of the minimum-variance frontier emerges. We then discard the bottom (dashed) half of the frontier, because it is inefficient. \n In the alternative approach, we draw a vertical line that represents the standard devia-\ntion constraint. We then consider all portfolios that plot on this line (have the same stan-dard deviation) and choose the one with the highest expected return, that is, the portfolio that plots highest on this vertical line. Repeating this procedure for many vertical lines (levels of standard deviation) gives us the points marked by circles that trace the upper por-tion of the minimum-variance frontier, the efficient frontier. \n When this step is completed, we have a list of efficient portfolios, because the solution \nto the optimization program includes the portfolio proportions,  w  \n i  , the expected return, \n E ( r   p  ), and the standard deviation,  s   p  . \n Let us restate what our portfolio manager has done so far. The estimates generated by \nthe security analysts were transformed into a set of expected rates of return and a covari-\nance matrix. This group of estimates we shall call the    input list.    This input list is then fed \ninto the optimization program. \n Before we proceed to the second step of choosing the optimal risky portfolio from the \nfrontier set, let us consider a practical point. Some clients may be subject to additional constraints. For example, many institutions are prohibited from taking short positions in any asset. For these clients the portfolio manager will add to the optimization program constraints that rule out negative (short) positions in the search for efficient portfolios. In this special case it is possible that single assets may be, in and of themselves, efficient risky portfolios. For example, the asset with the highest expected return will be a frontier portfolio because, without the opportunity of short sales, the only way to obtain that rate of return is to hold the asset as one\u2019s entire risky portfolio. \n Short-sale restrictions are by no means the only such constraints. For example, some \nclients may want to ensure a minimal level of expected dividend yield from the optimal portfolio. In this case the input list will be expanded to include a set of expected dividend yields  d  \n1 ,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0,\u00a0 d   n   and the optimization program will include an additional constraint that \nensures that the expected dividend yield of the portfolio will equal or exceed the desired \nlevel,  d.  \n Portfolio managers can tailor the efficient set to conform to any desire of the client. Of \ncourse, any constraint carries a price tag in the sense that an efficient frontier constructed subject to extra constraints will offer a Sharpe ratio inferior to that of a less constrained one. The client should be made aware of this cost and should carefully consider constraints that are not mandated by law. \n Another type of constraint is aimed at ruling out investments in industries or countries \nconsidered ethically or politically undesirable. This is referred to as  socially responsible \ninvesting,  which entails a cost in the form of a lower Sharpe ratio on the resultant con-strained, optimal portfolio. This cost can be justifiably viewed as a contribution to the underlying cause.  \n  Capital Allocation and the Separation Property\n  Now that we have the efficient frontier, we proceed to step two and introduce the risk-free asset.  Figure\u00a07.13  shows the efficient frontier plus three CALs representing various- portfolios from the efficient set. As before, we ratchet up the CAL by selecting different \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   223bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   223 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n eXcel APPLICATIONS: Optimal Portfolios \n A spreadsheet model featuring optimal risky portfolios \nis available on the Online Learning Center at   www\n.mhhe.com/bkm.   It contains a template that is similar to \nthe template developed in this section. The model can be \nused to find optimal mixes of securities for targeted levels \nof returns for both restricted and unrestricted portfolios. \nGraphs of the efficient frontier are generated for each set \nof inputs. The example available at our Web site applies \nthe model to portfolios constructed from equity indexes \n(called WEBS securities) of several countries.       Excel Questions \n    1.

Portfolio  P  maximizes the Sharpe ratio, the slope of the CAL from  F  to \nportfolios on the efficient frontier. At this point our portfolio manager is done. Portfolio  P  is \nthe optimal risky portfolio for the manager\u2019s clients.   \n There is yet another way to find the best risky \nportfolio, achievable by introducing the risk-free \n(T-bill) rate from the outset. In this approach, we \nask the spreadsheet program to maximize the Sharpe \nratio of portfolio  P.  The reason this is worth mention-\ning is that we can skip the charting of the efficient \nfrontier altogether and proceed directly to find the \nportfolio that produces the steepest CAL. The pro-\ngram maximizes the Sharpe ratio with no constraint \non expected return or variance at all (using just the \nfeasibility constraint that portfolio weights sum to \n1.0). Examination of  Figure\u00a07.13  shows that the solu-\ntion strategy is to find the portfolio producing the \nhighest slope of the CAL (Sharpe ratio) regardless of \nexpected return or SD. Expected return and standard \ndeviation are easily computed from the optimal port-\nfolio weights applied to the input list in Equations \n7.15 and 7.16. \n While this last approach does not immediately \nproduce the entire minimum-variance frontier, this \nE(r)\n(Global Minimum-Variance Portfolio)Ef\ufb01cient Frontier\nof Risky AssetsCAL( P)\nCAL( A)\nCAL( G)\nA\nGP\nF\n\u03c3\n Figure 7.13 Capital allocation lines with various \nportfolios from the efficient set  \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   224bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   224 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios 225\nshortcoming can be rectified by directly identifying two portfolios on the frontier. The first \nis the already familiar Global Minimum Variance portfolio, identified in  Figure\u00a07.12  as  G.  Portfolio  G  is achieved by minimizing variance without any constraint on the expected \nreturn; check this in  Figure\u00a07.13 . The expected return on portfolio  G  is higher than the risk-\nfree rate (its risk premium will be positive). \n Another portfolio that will be of great interest to us later is the portfolio on the ineffi-\ncient portion of the minimum-variance frontier with zero covariance (or correlation) with \nthe optimal risky portfolio. We will call this portfolio  Z.  Once we identify portfolio  P,  \nwe can find portfolio  Z  by solving in Excel for the portfolio that minimizes standard \ndeviation subject to having zero covariance with  P.  In later chapters we will return to this \nportfolio. \n An important property of frontier portfolios is that any portfolio formed by combining \ntwo portfolios from the minimum-variance frontier will also be on that frontier, with loca-tion along the frontier depending on the weights of that mix. Therefore, portfolio  P  plus \neither  G  or  Z  can be used to easily trace out the entire efficient frontier. \n This is a good time to ponder our results and their implementation. The most striking \nconclusion of all this analysis is that a portfolio manager will offer the same risky portfo-lio,  P,  to all clients regardless of their degree of risk aversion.  \n10   The degree of risk aversion \nof the client comes into play only in capital allocation, the selection of the desired point  along  the CAL. Thus the only difference between clients\u2019 choices is that the more risk-\naverse client will invest more in the risk-free asset and less in the optimal risky portfolio than will a less risk-averse client. However, both will use portfolio  P  as their optimal risky \ninvestment vehicle.  \n This result is called a    separation property;    it tells us that the portfolio choice problem \nmay be separated into two independent tasks.  \n11   The first task, determination of the optimal \nrisky portfolio, is purely technical. Given the manager\u2019s input list, the best risky portfolio is the same for all clients, regardless of risk aversion. However, the second task, capital allocation, depends on personal preference. Here the client is the decision maker.\n \n The crucial point is that the optimal portfolio  P  that the manager offers is the same for \nall clients. Put another way, investors with varying degrees of risk aversion would be satis-fied with a universe of only two mutual funds: a money market fund for risk-free invest-ments and a mutual fund that holds the optimal risky portfolio,  P,  on the tangency point \nof the CAL and the efficient frontier. This result makes professional management more efficient and hence less costly. One management firm can serve any number of clients with relatively small incremental administrative costs. \n In practice, however, different managers will estimate different input lists, thus deriv-\ning different efficient frontiers, and offer different \u201coptimal\u201d portfolios to their clients. The source of the disparity lies in the security analysis. It is worth mentioning here that the universal rule of GIGO (garbage in\u2013garbage out) also applies to security analysis. If the quality of the security analysis is poor, a passive portfolio such as a market index fund will result in a higher Sharpe ratio than an active portfolio that uses low-quality security analysis to tilt portfolio weights toward seemingly favorable (mispriced) securities. \n One particular input list that would lead to a worthless estimate of the efficient frontier \nis based on recent security average returns. If sample average returns over recent years are \n  10 Clients who impose special restrictions (constraints) on the manager, such as dividend yield, will obtain another \noptimal portfolio. Any constraint that is added to an optimization problem leads, in general, to a different and \ninferior optimum compared to an unconstrained program. \n  11 The separation property was first noted by Nobel laureate James Tobin, \u201cLiquidity Preference as Behavior \ntoward Risk,\u201d  Review of Economic Statistics  25 (February 1958), pp. 65\u201386. \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   225bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   225 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n226 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nused as proxies for the future return on the security, the noise in those estimates will make \nthe resultant efficient frontier virtually useless for portfolio construction. \n Consider a stock with an annual standard deviation of 50%. Even if one were to use \na 10-year average to estimate its expected return (and 10 years is almost ancient his-tory in the life of a corporation), the standard deviation of that estimate would still be    5 0 /\"10\n515.8%.   The chances that this average represents expected returns for the com-\ning year are negligible.  12   In Chapter 25, we demonstrate that efficient frontiers constructed \nfrom past data may be wildly optimistic in terms of the  apparent  opportunities they offer \nto improve Sharpe ratios.   \n As we have seen, optimal risky portfolios for different clients also may vary because \nof portfolio constraints such as dividend-yield requirements, tax considerations, or other client preferences. Nevertheless, this analysis suggests that a limited number of portfolios may be sufficient to serve the demands of a wide range of investors. This is the theoretical basis of the mutual fund industry. \n The (computerized) optimization technique is the easiest part of the portfolio construc-\ntion problem. The real arena of competition among portfolio managers is in sophisticated security analysis. This analysis, as well as its proper interpretation, is part of the art of portfolio construction.  \n13   \n  12 Moreover, you cannot avoid this problem by observing the rate of return on the stock more frequently. In \nChapter 5 we pointed out that the accuracy of the sample average as an estimate of expected return depends on \nthe length of the sample period, and is not improved by sampling more frequently within a given sample period. \n  13 You can find a nice discussion of some practical issues in implementing efficient diversification in a white \npaper prepared by Wealthcare Capital Management at this address:   www.financeware.com/ruminations/\nWP_EfficiencyDeficiency.pdf.   A copy of the report is also available at the Online Learning Center for this text, \n  www.mhhe.com/bkm.    Suppose that two portfolio managers who work for competing investment management houses each \nemploy a group of security analysts to prepare the input list for the Markowitz algorithm. When all is com-pleted, it turns out that the efficient frontier obtained by portfolio manager  A  dominates that of manager \n B.  By dominate, we mean that  A \u2019s optimal risky portfolio lies northwest of  B \u2019s. Hence, given a choice, inves-\ntors will all prefer the risky portfolio that lies on the CAL of  A.  \n     a.  What should be made of this outcome?  \n    b.  Should it be attributed to better security analysis by  A \u2019s analysts?  \n    c.  Could it be that  A \u2019s computer program is superior?  \n    d.  If you were advising clients (and had an advance glimpse at the efficient frontiers of various manag-\ners), would you tell them to periodically switch their money to the manager with the most northwest-erly portfolio?    CONCEPT CHECK 7.4 \n    The Power of Diversification \n Section 7.1 introduced the concept of diversification and the limits to the benefits of diver-\nsification resulting from systematic risk. Given the tools we have developed, we can recon-sider this intuition more rigorously and at the same time sharpen our insight regarding the power of diversification. \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   226bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   226 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios 227\n Recall from Equation 7.16, restated here, that the general formula for the variance of a \nportfolio is   \n sp25an\ni51an\nj51wiwj Cov (ri, rj)  (7.16)  \nConsider now the naive diversification strategy in which an  equally weighted  portfolio is \nconstructed, meaning that  w   i  \u00a0 5 \u00a01/ n  for each security. In this case Equation 7.16 may be \nrewritten as follows, where we break out the terms for which  i \u00a0 5 \u00a0 j  into a separate sum, \nnoting that Cov(r i, ri)   5si2:    \n sp251\nnan\ni511\nn si21an\nj51\nj2ian\ni51 1\nn2 Cov (ri, rj)  (7.17)  \nNote that there are  n  variance terms and  n ( n \u00a0 2 \u00a01) covariance terms in Equation 7.17. \n If we define the average variance and average covariance of the securities as   \n s251\nnan\ni51si2  (7.18)     \n Cov 51\nn(n21)an\nj51\nj2ian\ni51 Cov (ri, rj)  (7.19)  \nwe can express portfolio variance as   \n sp251\nn s21n21\nn Cov  (7.20)   \n Now examine the effect of diversification. When the average covariance among security \nreturns is zero, as it is when all risk is firm-specific, portfolio variance can be driven to zero. \nWe see this from Equation 7.20. The second term on the right-hand side will be zero in this scenario, while the first term approaches zero as  n  becomes larger. Hence when security \nreturns are uncorrelated, the power of diversification to reduce portfolio risk is unlimited. \n However, the more important case is the one in which economywide risk factors impart \npositive correlation among stock returns. In this case, as the portfolio becomes more highly diversified ( n  increases), portfolio variance remains positive. Although firm-specific risk, \nrepresented by the first term in Equation 7.20, is still diversified away, the second term simply approaches    \nCov  as  n  becomes greater. [Note that ( n \u00a0 2 \u00a0 1)/ n \u00a0 5 \u00a01 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 1/ n,  which \napproaches 1 for large  n. ] Thus the irreducible risk of a diversified portfolio depends on \nthe covariance of the returns of the component securities, which in turn is a function of the importance of systematic factors in the economy. \n To see further the fundamental relationship between systematic risk and security corre-\nlations, suppose for simplicity that all securities have a common standard deviation,  s , and \nall security pairs have a common correlation coefficient,  r . Then the covariance between \nall pairs of securities is  r  s  \n2 , and Equation 7.20 becomes   \n sp251\nn s21n21\nn rs2  (7.21)   \n The effect of correlation is now explicit. When  r \u00a0 5 \u00a00, we again obtain the insurance \nprinciple, where portfolio variance approaches zero as  n  becomes greater. For  r \u00a0.\u00a00, how-\never, portfolio variance remains positive. In fact, for  r \u00a0 5 \u00a01, portfolio variance equals  s  2  \nregardless of  n,  demonstrating that diversification is of no benefit: In the case of perfect \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   227bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   227 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2 2 8 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\ncorrelation, all risk is systematic. More generally, as  n  becomes greater, Equation 7.21 \nshows that systematic risk becomes  r  s  2 . \n  Table\u00a07.4  presents portfolio standard deviation as we include ever-greater numbers of \nsecurities in the portfolio for two cases,  r \u00a0 5 \u00a00 and  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.40. The table takes  s  to be 50%. As \none would expect, portfolio risk is greater when  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.40. More surprising, perhaps, is that \nportfolio risk diminishes far less rapidly as  n  increases in the positive correlation case. The \ncorrelation among security returns limits the power of diversification.  \n Note that for a 100-security portfolio, the standard deviation is 5% in the uncorrelated \ncase\u2014still significant compared to the potential of zero standard deviation. For  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.40, \nthe standard deviation is high, 31.86%, yet it is very close to undiversifiable systematic \nrisk in the infinite-sized security universe,    \"rs25\".43502531.62%.   At this point, \nfurther diversification is of little value. \n Perhaps the most important insight from the exercise is this: When we hold diversified \nportfolios, the contribution to portfolio risk of a particular security will depend on the \n covariance   of that security\u2019s return with those of other securities, and  not  on the security\u2019s \nvariance. As we shall see in Chapter 9, this implies that fair risk premiums also should \ndepend on covariances rather than total variability of returns.   \n Table 7.4 \n Risk reduction of \nequally weighted \nportfolios in \ncorrelated and \nuncorrelated \nuniverses r 5 0 r 5 .40\nUniverse \nSize nPortfolio \nWeights \nw\u00a05\u00a01/n\u00a0(%)Standard \nDeviation \n(%)Reduction \nin sStandard \nDeviation (%) Reduction in s\n1 100 50.00 14.64 50.00 8.17\n2 50 35.36 41.83\n5 20 22.36  1.95 36.06 0.70\n6 16.67 20.41 35.36\n10 10 15.81  0.73 33.91 0.20\n11 9.09 15.08 33.71\n20 5 11.18  0.27 32.79 0.06\n21 4.76 10.91 32.73\n100 1  5.00  0.02 31.86 0.00\n101 0.99  4.98 31.86\n Suppose that the universe of available risky securities consists of a large number of stocks, identically dis-\ntributed with  E ( r )\u00a0 5 \u00a015%,\u00a0 s \u00a0 5 \u00a060%, and a common correlation coefficient of  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.5. \n     a.

First, as a result of greater need and ability to save (for col-\nlege educations, recreation, longer life in retirement, health care needs, etc.), the demand for sophisticated investment management has increased enormously. Second, the widen-ing spectrum of financial markets and financial instruments has put sophisticated invest-ment beyond the capacity of many amateur investors. Finally, there are strong economies of scale in investment analysis. The end result is that the size of a competitive invest-ment company has grown with the industry, and efficiency in organization has become an important issue. \n A large investment company is likely to invest both in domestic and international mar-\nkets and in a broad set of asset classes, each of which requires specialized expertise. Hence the management of each asset-class portfolio needs to be decentralized, and it becomes impossible to simultaneously optimize the entire organization\u2019s risky portfolio in one stage, although this would be prescribed as optimal on  theoretical  grounds. In future chap-\nters we will see how optimization of decentralized portfolios can be mindful as well of the entire portfolio of which they are a part. \n The practice is therefore to optimize the security selection of each asset-class portfo-\nlio independently. At the same time, top management continually updates the asset allo-cation of the organization, adjusting the investment budget allotted to each asset-class portfolio.  \n  Optimal Portfolios and Nonnormal Returns \n The portfolio optimization techniques we have used so far assume normal distributions of returns in that standard deviation is taken to be a fully adequate measure of risk. However, potential nonnormality of returns requires us to pay attention as well to risk measures that focus on worst-case losses such as value at risk (VaR) or expected short-fall (ES). \n In Chapter 6 we suggested that capital allocation to the risky portfolio should be recon-\nsidered in the face of fat-tailed distributions that can result in extreme values of VaR and ES. Specifically, forecasts of greater than normal VaR and ES should encourage more moderate capital allocations to the risky portfolio. Accounting for the effect of diversifica-tion on VaR and ES would be useful as well. Unfortunately, the impact of diversification on tail risk cannot be easily anticipated. \n A practical way to estimate values of VaR and ES in the presence of fat tails is boot-\nstrapping (described in Section 5.9). We start with a historical sample of returns of each asset in our prospective portfolio. We compute the portfolio return corresponding to a draw of one return from each asset\u2019s history. We thus calculate as many of these random port-folio returns as we wish. Fifty thousand returns produced in this way can provide a good estimate of VaR and ES values. The forecasted values for VaR and ES of the mean-variance optimal portfolio can then be compared to other candidate portfolios. If these other portfo-lios yield sufficiently better VaR and ES values, we may prefer one of those to the mean-variance efficient portfolio.    \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   229bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   229 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n230 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n   7.5 Risk Pooling, Risk Sharing, and the Risk \nof Long-Term Investments *   \n  Diversification means that we spread our investment budget across a variety of assets and \nthus limit overall risk. Sometimes it is argued that spreading investments across time, so that average performance reflects returns in several investment periods, offers an analo-gous benefit dubbed \u201ctime diversification.\u201d A common belief is that time diversification can make long-term investing safer. \n Is this extension of diversification to investments over time valid? The question of how \nrisk increases when the horizon of a risky investment lengthens is analogous to risk pool-ing, the process by which an insurance company aggregates a large portfolio (or pool) of uncorrelated risks. However, the application of risk pooling to investment risk is widely misunderstood, as is the application of \u201cthe insurance principle\u201d to long-term investments. In this section, we try to clarify these issues and explore the appropriate extension of the insurance principle to investment risk.     \nRisk Pooling and the Insurance Principle \n    Risk pooling    means merging uncorrelated, risky projects as a means to reduce risk. Applied to the insurance business, risk pooling entails selling many uncorrelated insurance policies. This application of risk pooling has come to be known as the insurance principle. Conventional wisdom holds that risk pooling reduces risk, and that such pooling is the driving force behind risk management for the insurance industry. \n But even brief reflection should convince you that risk pooling cannot be the entire \nstory. How can  adding  bets that are independent of your other bets reduce your total expo-\nsure to risk? This would be little different from a gambler in Las Vegas arguing that a few more trips to the roulette table will reduce his total risk by diversifying his overall \u201cport-folio\u201d of wagers. You would immediately realize that the gambler now has more money at stake, and his overall potential swing in wealth is clearly wider: While his average gain or loss  per bet  may become more predictable as he repeatedly returns to the table, his total \nproceeds become less so. As we will see, the insurance principle is sometimes similarly misapplied to long-term investments by incorrectly extending what it implies about  aver-\nage  returns to predictions about  total  returns. \n Imagine a rich investor, Warren, who holds a $1 billion portfolio,  P.  The fraction of the \nportfolio invested in a risky asset,  A,  is  y,  leaving the fraction 1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 y  invested in the risk-\nfree rate. Asset  A \u2019s risk premium is  R,  and its standard deviation is  s . From Equations 6.3 \nand 6.4, the risk premium of the complete portfolio  P  is  R  \n P  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 yR,  its standard deviation is \n s   P  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 y  s , and the Sharpe ratio is  S   P  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 R / s . Now Warren identifies another risky asset,  B,  \nwith the same risk premium and standard deviation as  A.  Warren estimates that the correla-\ntion (and therefore covariance) between the two investments is zero, and he is intrigued at \nthe potential this offers for risk reduction through diversification. \n Given the benefits that Warren anticipates from diversification, he decides to take a \nposition in asset  B  equal in size to his existing position in asset  A.  He therefore transfers \nanother fraction,  y,  of wealth from the risk-free asset to asset  B.  This leaves his total port-\nfolio allocated as follows: The fraction  y  is still invested in asset  A,  an additional invest-\nment of  y  is invested in  B,  and 1\u00a0 2 \u00a02 y  is in the risk-free asset. Notice that this strategy is \n *The material in this section is more challenging.

We will denote Warren\u2019s new portfolio as  Z.  \nWe can compute the risk premium of portfolio  Z  from Equation 7.2, its variance from \nEquation 7.3, and thus its Sharpe ratio. Remember that capital  R  denotes the risk premium \nof each asset and the risk premium of the risk-free asset is zero. When calculating portfolio variance, we use the fact that covariance is zero. Thus, for Portfolio  Z:   \nR\nZ5yR1yR1(122y)052yR (double RP)\nsZ25y2s21y2s21052y2s2(double the variance of P)\nsZ5\"sZ25ys\"2 (\"251.41 times the standard deviation of P)\nSZ5RZ/sZ52yR/(ys\"2)5\"2R/s (\"251.41 times Sharpe ratio of P)\n The good news from these results is that the Sharpe ratio of  Z  is higher than that of  P  by \nthe factor    \" 2.  Its excess rate of return is double that of  P,  yet its standard deviation is only \n   \"2  times larger. The bad news is that by increasing the scale of the risky investment, the \nstandard deviation of the portfolio also increases by    \"2.  \n We might now imagine that instead of two uncorrelated assets, Warren has access to \nmany. Repeating our analysis, we would find that with  n  assets the Sharpe ratio under \nstrategy  Z  increases (relative to its original value) by a factor of    \"n  to    \" n3R/s.  But the \ntotal risk of the pooling strategy  Z  will increase by the same multiple, to    s\"n.  \n This analysis illustrates both the opportunities and limitations of pure risk pooling: \nPooling increases the scale of the risky investment (from  y  to 2 y ) by adding an additional \nposition in another, uncorrelated asset. This addition of another risky bet also increases the \nsize of the risky budget. So risk pooling  by itself  does not reduce risk, despite the fact that \nit benefits from the lack of correlation across policies. \n The insurance principle tells us only that risk increases less than proportionally to the \nnumber of policies insured when the policies are uncorrelated; hence profitability\u2014in this application, the Sharpe ratio\u2014increases. But this effect does not actually reduce risk. \n This might limit the potential economies of scale of an ever-growing portfolio such \nas that of a large insurer. You can interpret each \u201casset\u201d in our analysis as one insurance policy. Each policy written requires the insurance company to set aside additional capital to cover potential losses. The insurance company invests its capital until it needs to pay out on claims. Selling more policies entails increasing the total position in risky investments and therefore the capital that must be allocated to those policies. As the company invests in more uncorrelated assets (insurance policies), the Sharpe ratio continuously increases (which is good), but since more funds are invested in risky policies, the overall risk of the portfolio rises (which is bad). As the number of policies grows, the risk of the pool will certainly grow\u2014despite \u201cdiversification\u201d across policies. Eventually, that growing risk will overwhelm the company\u2019s available capital. \n Insurance analysts often think in terms of probability of loss. Their mathematically cor-\nrect interpretation of the insurance principle is that the probability of loss declines with risk pooling. This interpretation relates to the fact that the Sharpe ratio (profitability) increases with risk pooling. But to equate the declining probability of loss to reduction in total risk is erroneous; the latter is measured by overall standard deviation, which increases with risk pooling. (Again, think about the gambler in Las Vegas. As he returns over and over again to the roulette table, the probability that he will lose becomes ever more certain, but the magnitude of potential dollar gains or losses becomes ever greater.) Thus risk pooling allows neither investors nor insurance companies to shed risk. However, the increase in risk can be overcome when risk pooling is augmented by  risk sharing,  as discussed in the \nnext subsection.  \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   231bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   231 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n232 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n  Risk Sharing \n Now think about a variation on the risk pooling portfolio  Z.  Imagine that Warren has iden-\ntified several attractive insurance policies and wishes to invest in all of them. For simplic-\nity, we will look at the case of two policies, so the pool will have the same properties as portfolio  Z.  We saw that if Warren invested in this two-policy pool, his total risk would be \n   s\nZ5ys\"2.  But if this is more risk than he is willing to bear, what might he do? \n His solution is    risk sharing,    the act of selling shares in an attractive risky portfolio to \nlimit risk and yet maintain the Sharpe ratio (profitability) of the resultant position. Suppose that every time a new risky asset is added to the portfolio, Warren sells off a portion of his investment in the pool to maintain the total funds invested in risky assets unchanged. For example, when a second asset is added, he sells half of his position to other investors. While the total investment budget directed into risky assets is therefore unchanged, it is equally divided between assets  A  and  B,  with weights in each of  y /2. In following this strat-\negy, the risk-free component of his complete portfolio remains fixed with weight 1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 y.  We \nwill call this strategy  V.  \n If you compare the risk-pooling strategy  Z  with the risk-pooling-plus-risk-sharing strat-\negy  V,  you will notice that they both entail an investment in the pool of two assets; the only \ndifference between them is that the risk-sharing strategy sells off half the combined pool to maintain a risky portfolio of  fixed size.  While the weight of the total risky pool in strategy  Z  \nis 2 y,  in the risk-sharing strategy, the risky weight is only one-half that level. Therefore, we \ncan find the properties of the risk-sharing portfolio by substituting  y  for 2 y  in each formula \nor, equivalently, substituting  y /2 for  y  in the following table. \no i l o f t r o P : g n i l o o P k s i RZ o i l o f t r o P : g n i r a h S k s i RV\nRZ 2RR V 2(y/2)Ry R\nZ255\n2y22\nV255\n2y/22255\ny22/2\nZ5Z25y 2V5V25y/2\nS ()Z5RZ/Z52yR/y 2 52R/ SV5RV/V5 2R/y\n We observe that portfolio  V  matches the attractive Sharpe ratio of portfolio  Z,  but with \nlower volatility. Thus risk sharing  combined  with risk pooling is the key to the insurance \nindustry. True diversification means spreading a portfolio of  fixed size  across many assets, \nnot merely adding more risky bets to an ever-growing risky portfolio. \n To control his total risk, Warren had to sell off a fraction of the pool of assets. This \nimplies that a portion of those assets must now be held by someone else. For example, \nif the assets are insurance policies, other investors must be sharing the risk, perhaps by buying shares in the insurance company. Alternatively, insurance companies commonly \u201creinsure\u201d their risk by selling off portions of the policies to other investors or insurance companies, thus explicitly sharing the risk. \n We can easily generalize Warren\u2019s example to the case of more than two assets. \nSuppose the risky pool has  n  assets. Then the volatility of the risk-sharing portfolio will \nbe    s\nV5ys/\"n,  and its Sharpe ratio will be    \"nR/s.  Clearly, both of these improve as  n  \nincreases. Think back to our gambler at the roulette wheel one last time. He was wrong to argue that diversification means that 100 bets are less risky than 1 bet. His intuition would be correct, however, if he shared those 100 bets with 100 of his friends. A 1/100 share of 100 bets is in fact less risky than one bet. Fixing the amount of his total money at risk as that money is spread across more independent bets is the way for him to reduce risk.  \n14    \n  14 For the Las Vegas gambler, risk sharing makes the gambles ever more certain to produce a  negative  rate of \nreturn, highlighting the illness that characterizes compulsive gambling. \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   232bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   232 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios 233\n With risk sharing, one can set up an insurance company of any size, amassing a large \nportfolio of policies and limiting total risk by selling shares among many investors. As the \nSharpe ratio steadily increases with the number of policies written, while the risk to each diversified shareholder falls, the size of ever-more-profitable insurance companies appears unlimited. In reality, however, two problems put a damper on this process. First, burdens related to problems of managing very large firms will sooner or later eat into the increased gross margins. More important, the issue of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d may emerge. The possibility of error in assessing the risk of each policy or misestimating the correlations across losses on the pooled policies (or worse yet, intentional underestimation of risk) can cause an insur-ance company to fail. As we saw in Chapter 1, too big to fail means that such failure can lead to related failures among the firm\u2019s trading partners. This is similar to what happened in the financial crisis of 2008. The jury is still out on the role of lack of scruples in this affair. It is hoped that future regulation will put real limits on exaggerated optimism concerning the power of diversification to limit risk, despite the appealing mitigation of risk sharing.  \n  Investment for the Long Run \n Now we turn to the implications of risk pooling and risk sharing for long-term investing. Think of extending an investment horizon for another period (which adds the uncertainty of that period\u2019s risky return) as analogous to adding another risky asset or insurance policy to a pool of assets. \n Examining the impact of an extension of the investment horizon requires us to clarify \nwhat the alternative is. Suppose you consider an investment in a risky portfolio over the next 2 years, which we\u2019ll call the \u201clong-term investment.\u201d How should you compare this decision to a \u201cshort-run investment\u201d? We must compare these two strategies over the same period, that is, 2 years. The short-term investment therefore must be interpreted as invest-ing in the risky portfolio over 1 year and in the risk-free asset over the other. \n Once we agree on this comparison, and assuming the risky return on the first year is \nuncorrelated with that of the second, it becomes clear that the \u201clong-term\u201d strategy is analogous to portfolio  Z.  This is because holding on to the risky investment in the sec-\nond year (rather than withdrawing to the risk-free rate) piles up more risk, just as selling another insurance policy does. Put differently, the long-term investment may be considered analogous to risk pooling. While extending a risky investment to the long run improves the Sharpe ratio (as does risk pooling), it also increases risk. Thus \u201ctime diversification\u201d is not really diversification. \n The more accurate analogy to risk sharing for a long-term horizon is to spread the risky \ninvestment budget across each of the investment periods. Compare the following three strategies applied to the whole investment budget over a 2-year horizon:\n    1. Invest the whole budget at risk for one period, and then withdraw the entire \nproceeds, placing them in a risk-free asset in the other period. Because you are invested in the risky asset for only 1 year, the risk premium over the whole investment period is  R,  the 2-year SD is  s , and the 2-year Sharpe ratio is \n S \u00a0 5 \u00a0 R / s .  \n   2. Invest the whole budget in the risky asset for both periods. The 2-year risk premium \nis 2 R  (assuming continuously compounded rates), the 2-year variance is 2 s  \n2 , the \n2-year SD is    s\"2,  and the 2-year Sharpe ratio is    S5R\"2/s.  This is analogous to \nrisk pooling, taking two \u201cbets\u201d on the risky portfolio instead of one (as in Strategy 1).  \n   3. Invest half the investment budget in the risky position in each of two periods, plac-\ning the remainder of funds in the risk-free asset. The 2-year risk premium is  R,  \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   233bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   233 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm234 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nthe 2-year variance is 2\u00a0 3 \u00a0(\u00bd  s ) 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 s  2 /2, the SD is    s/\"2,  and the Sharpe ratio is \n   S5R\"2/s.  This is analogous to risk sharing, taking a fractional position in each \nyear\u2019s investment return.   \nStrategy 3 is less risky than either alternative. Its expected total return equals Strategy 1\u2019s, \nyet its risk is lower and therefore its Sharpe ratio is higher. It achieves the same Sharpe ratio as Strategy 2 but with standard deviation reduced by a factor of 2. In summary, its Sharpe ratio is at least as good as either alternative and, more to the point, its total risk is less than either. \n We conclude that risk does not fade in the long run. An investor who can invest in an \nattractive portfolio for only one period, and chooses to invest a given budget in that period, would find it preferable to put money at risk in that portfolio in as many periods as allowed  but will decrease the risky budget in each period.  Simple risk pooling, or in this case, time \ndiversification, does not reduce risk.     \n     1 .   The expected return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the component security expected \nreturns with the investment proportions as weights.  \n    2 .   The variance of a portfolio is the weighted sum of the elements of the covariance matrix with the product of the investment proportions as weights. Thus the variance of each asset is weighted by the square of its investment proportion. The covariance of each pair of assets appears twice in the covariance matrix; thus the portfolio variance includes twice each covariance weighted by the product of the investment proportions in each of the two assets.  \n    3 .   Even if the covariances are positive, the portfolio standard deviation is less than the weighted average of the component standard deviations, as long as the assets are not perfectly positively correlated. Thus portfolio diversification is of value as long as assets are less than perfectly correlated.  \n    4 .   The greater an asset\u2019s covariance with the other assets in the portfolio, the more it contributes to portfolio variance. An asset that is perfectly negatively correlated with a portfolio can serve as a perfect hedge. The perfect hedge asset can reduce the portfolio variance to zero.  \n    5 .   The efficient frontier is the graphical representation of a set of portfolios that maximize expected return for each level of portfolio risk. Rational investors will choose a portfolio on the efficient frontier.  \n    6 .   A portfolio manager identifies the efficient frontier by first establishing estimates for asset expected returns and the covariance matrix. This input list is then fed into an optimization pro-gram that reports as outputs the investment proportions, expected returns, and standard deviations of the portfolios on the efficient frontier.  \n    7 .   In general, portfolio managers will arrive at different efficient portfolios because of differences in methods and quality of security analysis. Managers compete on the quality of their security analysis relative to their management fees.  \n    8 .   If a risk-free asset is available and input lists are identical, all investors will choose the same portfolio on the efficient frontier of risky assets: the portfolio tangent to the CAL. All investors with identical input lists will hold an identical risky portfolio, differing only in how much each allocates to this optimal portfolio and to the risk-free asset. This result is characterized as the separation principle of portfolio construction.  \n    9 .   Diversification is based on the allocation of a  fixed  portfolio across several assets, limiting \nthe exposure to any one source of risk. Adding additional risky assets to a portfolio, thereby increasing the total amounts invested, does not reduce dollar risk, even if it makes the rate of return more predictable. This is because that uncertainty is applied to a larger investment base.

Suppose that you have $1 million and the following two opportunities from which to construct \na portfolio:\n     a.  Risk-free asset earning 12% per year.  \n    b.  Risky asset with expected return of 30% per year and standard deviation of 40%.    \n   If you construct a portfolio with a standard deviation of 30%, what is its expected rate of return?   \n  The following data are for Problems 17 through 19:  The correlation coefficients \nbetween pairs of stocks are as follows: Corr( A,   B )\u00a0 5 \u00a0.85;\u00a0Corr( A,   C )\u00a0 5 \u00a0.60;\u00a0Corr( A,   D )\u00a0 5 \u00a0.45. \nEach stock has an expected return of 8% and a standard deviation of 20%. \n    17. If your entire portfolio is now composed of stock  A  and you can add some of only one stock to \nyour portfolio, would you choose (explain your choice):\n     a.   B.       c.    D.   \n    b.

Repeat the analysis of \nChallenge Problem 20 for the real rates of return.   \nThe following information applies to Problems 22 through 26: Greta, an elderly inves-\ntor, has a degree of risk aversion of A\u00a0 5\u00a03 when applied to return on wealth over a \n3-year horizon. She is pondering two portfolios, the S&P 500 and a hedge fund, as well as a number of 3-year strategies. (All rates are annual, continuously compounded.) The S&P 500 risk premium is estimated at 5% per year, with a SD of 20%. The hedge fund risk premium is estimated at 10% with a SD of 35%. The return on each of these portfolios in any year is uncorrelated with its return or the return of any other portfo-lio in any other year. The hedge fund management claims the correlation coefficient between the annual returns on the S&P 500 and the hedge fund in the same year is zero, but Greta believes this is far from certain.\n 22. Compute the estimated 3-year risk premiums, SDs, and Sharpe ratios for the two portfolios.\n 23. Assuming the correlation between the annual returns on the two portfolios is indeed zero, what \nwould be the optimal asset allocation? What should be Greta\u2019s capital allocation?\n 24. If the correlation coefficient between annual portfolio returns is 0.3, what is the annual covariance? 25. With correlation of 0.3, what is the covariance between the 3-year returns? 26. Repeat Problem 15 using an annual correlation of 0.3.

Jason Jones, financial vice \npresident of Wilstead, noted that Hennessy had rather consistently achieved the best record among \nthe Wilstead\u2019s six equity managers. Performance of the Hennessy portfolio had been clearly superior \nto that of the S&P 500 in 4 of the past 5 years. In the one less-favorable year, the shortfall was trivial. \n Hennessy is a \u201cbottom-up\u201d manager. The firm largely avoids any attempt to \u201ctime the market.\u201d It \nalso focuses on selection of individual stocks, rather than the weighting of favored industries. \n There is no apparent conformity of style among Wilstead\u2019s six equity managers. The five manag-\ners, other than Hennessy, manage portfolios aggregating $250 million made up of more than 150 \nindividual issues. \n Jones is convinced that Hennessy is able to apply superior skill to stock selection, but the favor-\nable returns are limited by the high degree of diversification in the portfolio. Over the years, the \nportfolio generally held 40\u201350 stocks, with about 2%\u20133% of total funds committed to each issue. \nThe reason Hennessy seemed to do well most years was that the firm was able to identify each year \n10 or 12 issues that registered particularly large gains. \n On the basis of this overview, Jones outlined the following plan to the Wilstead pension committee: \n Let\u2019s tell Hennessy to limit the portfolio to no more than 20 stocks. Hennessy will double the \ncommitments to the stocks that it really favors, and eliminate the remainder. Except for this \none new restriction, Hennessy should be free to manage the portfolio exactly as before. \n All the members of the pension committee generally supported Jones\u2019s proposal because all \nagreed that Hennessy had seemed to demonstrate superior skill in selecting stocks. Yet the proposal \nwas a considerable departure from previous practice, and several committee members raised ques-\ntions. Respond to each of the following questions. \n    1 .      a.  Will the limitation to 20 stocks likely increase or decrease the risk of the portfolio? Explain.  \n    b.  Is there any way Hennessy could reduce the number of issues from 40 to 20 without signifi-\ncantly affecting risk? Explain.     \n   2. One committee member was particularly enthusiastic concerning Jones\u2019s proposal. He suggested \nthat Hennessy\u2019s performance might benefit further from reduction in the number of issues to 10. \nIf the reduction to 20 could be expected to be advantageous, explain why reduction to 10 might \nbe less likely to be advantageous. (Assume that Wilstead will evaluate the Hennessy portfolio \nindependently of the other portfolios in the fund.)  \n   3. Another committee member suggested that, rather than evaluate each managed portfolio indepen-\ndently of other portfolios, it might be better to consider the effects of a change in the Hennessy \nportfolio on the total fund. Explain how this broader point of view could affect the committee \ndecision to limit the holdings in the Hennessy portfolio to either 10 or 20 issues.  \n   4. Which one of the following portfolios cannot lie on the efficient frontier as described by Markowitz?  \n  Portfolio Expected Return (%) Standard Deviation (%)\na. W 15 36\nb. X 12 15\nc. Z   5   7\nd. Y   9 21\n   5. Which statement about portfolio diversification is correct?\n     a.  Proper diversification can reduce or eliminate systematic risk.  \n    b.  Diversification reduces the portfolio\u2019s expected return because it reduces a portfolio\u2019s total risk.  \n    c.  As more securities are added to a portfolio, total risk typically would be expected to fall at a \ndecreasing rate.  \n    d.  The risk-reducing benefits of diversification do not occur meaningfully until at least 30 indi-\nvidual securities are included in the portfolio.     \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   238bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   238 6/18/13   8:11 PM6/18/13   8:11 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios 239\n   6. The measure of risk for a security held in a diversified portfolio is:\n     a.  Specific risk.  \n    b.  Standard deviation of returns.  \n    c.  Reinvestment risk.      d.  Covariance.     \n   7. Portfolio theory as described by Markowitz is most concerned with:\n     a.  The elimination of systematic risk.      b.  The effect of diversification on portfolio risk.  \n    c.  The identification of unsystematic risk.      d.  Active portfolio management to enhance return.     \n   8. Assume that a risk-averse investor owning stock in Miller Corporation decides to add the stock \nof either Mac or Green Corporation to her portfolio. All three stocks offer the same expected \nreturn and total variability. The covariance of return between Miller and Mac is  2 .05 and \nbetween Miller and Green is  1 .05. Portfolio risk is expected to:\n     a.  Decline more when the investor buys Mac.  \n    b.  Decline more when the investor buys Green.  \n    c.  Increase when either Mac or Green is bought.      d.  Decline or increase, depending on other factors.     \n   9. Stocks  A,   B,  and  C  have the same expected return and standard deviation.

Efficient frontiers derived by portfolio managers depend on forecasts of the rates of return on \nvarious securities and estimates of risk, that is, the covariance matrix. The forecasts themselves do not control outcomes. Thus preferring managers with rosier forecasts (northwesterly frontiers) is tantamount to rewarding the bearers of good news and punishing the bearers of bad news. What we should do is reward bearers of  accurate  news. Thus if you get a glimpse of the frontiers \n(forecasts) of portfolio managers on a regular basis, what you want to do is develop the track record of their forecasting accuracy and steer your advisees toward the more accurate forecaster. Their portfolio choices will, in the long run, outperform the field.  \n   5. The parameters are  E ( r )\u00a0 5 \u00a015,\u00a0 s \u00a0 5 \u00a060, and the correlation between any pair of stocks is  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.5.\n    a .

Because the stocks are identical, efficient portfolios are equally weighted. To obtain a standard \ndeviation of 43%, we need to solve for  n:    \n4325602\nn1.53602(n21)\nn\n1,849n 5 3,600 1 1,800n 2 1,800\nn51,800\n49536.73  \n  Thus we need 37 stocks and will come in with volatility slightly under the target.  \n   c .

With 37 stocks the standard deviation is 43%, of which nonsystematic risk is .57%.  \n   d .   If the risk-free is 10%, then the risk premium on any size portfolio is 15\u00a0 2 \u00a010\u00a0 5 \u00a05%. The \nstandard deviation of a well-diversified portfolio is (practically) 42.43%; hence the slope of the CAL is   \nS 5 5/42.43 5 .1178        \n  Several software packages can be used to generate the efficient frontier. We will dem-\nonstrate the method using Microsoft Excel. Excel is far from the best program for this purpose and is limited in the number of assets it can handle, but working through a simple portfolio optimizer in Excel can illustrate concretely the nature of the calculations used in more sophisticated \u201cblack-box\u201d programs. You will find that even in Excel, the computa-tion of the efficient frontier is fairly easy. \n We apply the Markowitz portfolio optimization program to a practical problem of inter-\nnational diversification. We take the perspective of a portfolio manager serving U.S. clients, who wishes to construct for the next year an optimal risky portfolio of large stocks in the U.S and six developed capital markets (Japan, Germany, U.K., France, Canada, and Australia). First we describe the input list: forecasts of risk premiums and the covariance matrix. Next, we describe Excel\u2019s Solver, and finally we show the solution to the manager\u2019s problem. \n      The Covariance Matrix \n To capture recent risk parameters the manager compiles an array of 60 recent monthly (annualized) rates of return, as well as the monthly T-bill rates for the same period. \n The standard deviations of excess returns are shown in  Spreadsheet 7A.1  (column C). \nThey range from 14.93% (U.K. large stocks) to 22.7% (Germany). For perspective on how these parameters can change over time, standard deviations for the period 1991\u20132000 are also shown (column B). In addition, we present the correlation coefficient between large stocks in the six foreign markets with U.S. large stocks for the same two periods. Here we see that correlations are higher in the more recent period, consistent with the process of globalization. \n The covariance matrix shown in  Spreadsheet 7A.2  was estimated from the array of 60 \nreturns of the seven countries using the COV ARIANCE function from the dialog box of  Data Analysis  in Excel\u2019s Tools menu.

As we discussed in Chapter 5, estimating expected returns using histori-cal data is unreliable. Consider, for example, the negative average excess returns on U.S. large stocks over the period 2001\u20132005 (cell G6) and, more generally, the big differences in average returns between the 1991\u20132000 and 2001\u20132005 periods, as demonstrated in columns F and G. \n In this example, we simply present the manager\u2019s forecasts of future returns as shown in \ncolumn H. In Chapter 8 we will establish a framework that makes the forecasting process more explicit.  \n  The Bordered Covariance Matrix and Portfolio Variance \n The covariance matrix in  Spreadsheet 7A.2  is bordered by the portfolio weights, as explained in Section 7.2 and  Table\u00a07.2 . The values in cells A18\u2013A24, to the left of the cova-riance matrix, will be selected by the optimization program. For now, we arbitrarily input 1.0 for the U.S. and zero for the others. Cells A16\u2013I16, above the covariance matrix, must be set equal to the column of weights on the left, so that they will change in tandem as the column weights are changed by Excel\u2019s Solver. Cell A25 sums the column weights and is used to force the optimization program to set the sum of portfolio weights to 1.0. \n Cells C25\u2013I25, below the covariance matrix, are used to compute the portfolio variance \nfor any set of weights that appears in the borders. Each cell accumulates the contribution to portfolio variance from the column above it. It uses the function SUMPRODUCT to accomplish this task. For example, row 33 shows the formula used to derive the value that appears in cell C25. \n Finally, the short column A26\u2013A28 below the bordered covariance matrix presents port-\nfolio statistics computed from the bordered covariance matrix. First is the portfolio risk premium in cell A26, with formula shown in row 35, which multiplies the column of port-folio weights by the column of forecasts (H6\u2013H12) from  Spreadsheet 7A.1 . Next is the portfolio standard deviation in cell A27. The variance is given by the sum of cells C25\u2013I25 below the bordered covariance matrix. Cell A27 takes the square root of this sum to pro-duce the standard deviation. The last statistic is the portfolio Sharpe ratio, cell A28, which is the slope of the CAL (capital allocation line) that runs through the portfolio constructed using the column weights (the value in cell A28 equals cell A26 divided by cell A27). The optimal risky portfolio is the one that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.  \n  Using the Excel Solver \n Excel\u2019s Solver is a user-friendly, but quite powerful, optimizer. It has three parts: (1) an objective function, (2) decision variables, and (3) constraints.  Figure 7A.1  shows three pictures of the Solver. For the current discussion we refer to picture A. \n  The top panel of the Solver lets you choose a target cell for the \u201cobjective function,\u201d \nthat is, the variable you are trying to optimize. In picture A, the target cell is A27, the port-folio standard deviation. Below the target cell, you can choose whether your objective is to maximize, minimize, or set your objective function equal to a value that you specify. Here we choose to minimize the portfolio standard deviation. \nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   246bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   246 6/18/13   8:12 PM6/18/13   8:12 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios 247\n The next panel contains the decision variables. These are cells that the Solver can \nchange in order to optimize the objective function in the target cell. Here, we input cells \nA18\u2013A24, the portfolio weights that we select to minimize portfolio volatility. \n The bottom panel of the Solver can include any number of constraints. One constraint \nthat must always appear in portfolio optimization is the \u201cfeasibility constraint,\u201d namely, \nthat portfolio weights sum to 1.0. When we bring up the constraint dialogue box, we spec-\nify that cell A25 (the sum of weights) be set equal to 1.0.  \n  Finding the Minimum Variance Portfolio \n It is helpful to begin by identifying the global minimum variance portfolio ( G ). This pro-\nvides the starting point of the efficient part of the frontier. Once we input the target cell, the \ndecision variable cells, and the feasibility constraint, as in picture A, we can select \u201csolve\u201d \nand the Solver returns portfolio  G.  We copy the portfolio statistics and weights to our output \n Spreadsheet 7A.3 . Column C in  Spreadsheet 7A.3  shows that the lowest standard deviation \n(SD) that can be achieved with our input list is 11.32%. Notice that the SD of portfolio  G  is \nconsiderably lower than even the lowest SD of the individual indexes. From the risk premium \nof portfolio  G  (3.83%) we begin building the efficient frontier with ever-larger risk premiums. \n   Charting the Efficient Frontier of Risky Portfolios \n We determine the desired risk premiums (points on the efficient frontier) that we wish to \nuse to construct the graph of the efficient frontier. It is good practice to choose more points \nin the neighborhood of portfolio  G  because the frontier has the greatest curvature in that \nregion. It is sufficient to choose for the highest point the highest risk premium from the \n Figure 7A.1 Solver dialog box  \nB\nCA\nbod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   247bod61671_ch07_205-255.indd   247 6/18/13   8:12 PM6/18/13   8:12 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm2 4 8 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\ninput list (here, 8% for Germany). You can produce the entire efficient frontier in minutes \nfollowing this procedure. \n    1. Input to the Solver a constraint that says: Cell A26 (the portfolio risk premium) \nmust equal the value in cell E41. The Solver at this point is shown in picture B of \n Figure 7A.1 . Cell E41 will be used to change the required risk premium and thus \ngenerate different points along the frontier.  \n   2. For each additional point on the frontier, you input a different desired risk premium \ninto cell E41, and ask the Solver to solve again.  \n   3. Every time the Solver gives you a solution to the request in (2), copy the results into \n Spreadsheet 7A.3 , which tabulates the collection of points along the efficient fron-\ntier. For the next step, change cell E41 and repeat from step 2.    \n  Finding the Optimal Risky Portfolio on the Efficient Frontier \n Now that we have an efficient frontier, we look for the portfolio with the highest Sharpe \nratio. This is the efficient frontier portfolio that is tangent to the CAL. To find it, we just need \nto make two changes to the Solver. First, change the target cell from cell A27 to cell A28, \nthe Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, and request that the value in this cell be maximized. Next, \neliminate the constraint on the risk premium that may be left over from the last time you \nused the Solver. At this point the Solver looks like picture C in  Figure 7A.1 . \n The Solver now yields the optimal risky portfolio. Copy the statistics for the optimal \nportfolio and its weights to your  Spreadsheet 7A.3 . In order to get a clean graph, place \nthe column of the optimal portfolio in  Spreadsheet 7A.3  so that the risk premiums of all \nportfolios in the spreadsheet are steadily increasing from the risk premium of portfolio  G\n(3.83%) all the way up to 8%. \n The efficient frontier is graphed using the data in cells C45\u2013I45 (the horizontal or \nx -axis is portfolio standard deviation) and C44\u2013I44 (the vertical or  y -axis is portfolio risk \n premium). The resulting graph appears in  Figure 7A.2 .    \n The Optimal CAL \n It is instructive to superimpose on the graph of the efficient frontier in  Figure 7A.2  the CAL \nthat identifies the optimal risky portfolio. This CAL has a slope equal to the Sharpe ratio of \n Figure 7A.2 Efficient frontier and CAL for country stock indexes  \n.0900\n.0800\n.0700\n.0600\n.0500\n.0400\n.0300\n.1000 .1200 .1400 .1600 .1800 .2000 .2200 .2400\nStandard DeviationRisk PremiumRisk Premium SD Slope\nEf\ufb01cient Pf\nNo short\nNo shortMin.

We denote the assets \n D  and  E  (which you may think of as debt and equity), but the risk and return parameters \nwe use in this appendix are not necessarily consistent with those used in Section 7.2. \n      Expected Returns \nWe use \u201cexpected value\u201d and \u201cmean\u201d interchangeably. For an analysis with  n  scenarios, \nwhere the rate of return in scenario  i  is  r ( i ) with probability  p ( i ), the expected return is   \n E(r)5an\ni51p(i)r(i)  (7B.1)  \nIf you were to increase the rate of return assumed for each scenario by some amount D, \nthen the mean return will increase by D. If you multiply the rate in each scenario by a  factor  w,   the new mean will be multiplied by that factor:  \n  an\ni51p(i)33r (i)1D 45an\ni51p(i)3r (i)1Dan\ni51p(i)5E(r)1D (7B.2)\n an\ni51p(i)33wr(i)45wan\ni51p(i)3r(i)5wE(r)the optimal risky portfolio. Therefore, we add at the bottom of  Spreadsheet 7A.3  a row with entries obtained by multiplying the SD of each column\u2019s portfolio by the Sharpe ratio of the optimal risky portfolio from cell H46. This results in the risk premium for each portfolio along the CAL efficient frontier. We now add a series to the graph with the standard deviations in B45\u2013I45 as the  x -axis and cells B54\u2013I54 as the  y -axis. You can see this CAL in  Figure 7A.2 .  \n  The Optimal Risky Portfolio and the Short-Sales Constraint \n With the input list used by the portfolio manager, the optimal risky portfolio calls for signifi-cant short positions in the stocks of France and Canada (see column H of   Spreadsheet\u00a07A.3 ). In many cases the portfolio manager is prohibited from taking short positions. If so, we need to amend the program to preclude short sales. \n To accomplish this task, we repeat the exercise, but with one change. We add to the \nSolver the following constraint: Each element in the column of portfolio weights, A18\u2013A24, must be greater than or equal to zero. You should try to produce the short-sale con-strained efficient frontier in your own spreadsheet. The graph of the constrained frontier is also shown in  Figure 7A.2 .      \n Column C of  Spreadsheet 7B.1  shows scenario rates of return for debt,  D.  In column \nD we add 3% to each scenario return and in column E we multiply each rate by .4. The spreadsheet shows how we compute the expected return for columns C, D, and E.

In contrast, standard deviation, the \nsquare root of variance, has the same dimension as the original returns, and therefore is easier to interpret as a measure of return variability. \n When you add a fixed incremental return, D, to each scenario return, you increase the \nmean return by that same increment. Therefore, the deviation of the realized return in each scenario from the mean return is unaffected, and both variance and SD are unchanged. In contrast, when you multiply the return in each scenario by a factor  w,  the variance is mul-\ntiplied by the square of that factor (and the SD is multiplied by  w ):   \nVar(wr)5a\nn\ni51p(i)33wr(i)2E(wr)425w2an\ni51p(i)3r(i)2E(r)425w2s2\n SD (wr)5\"w2s25ws(r)  (7B.5)   \n Excel does not have a direct function to compute variance and standard deviation for \na scenario analysis. Its STDEV and V AR functions are designed for time series. We need to calculate the probability-weighted squared deviations directly. To avoid having to first compute columns of squared deviations from the mean, however, we can simplify our problem by expressing the variance as a difference between two easily computable terms:   \ns\n2(r) 5 E[r 2 E(r)]2 5 E{r2 1 [E(r)]2 2 2rE(r)}\n 5E(r2)13E(r)4222E(r)E(r)  (7B.6)   \n5E(r2)23E(r)425an\ni51p(i)r(i)22Ban\ni51p(i)r(i)R2\n  15 Variance (here, of an asset rate of return) is not the only possible choice to quantify variability. An alternative \nwould be to use the  absolute  deviation from the mean instead of the  squared  deviation. Thus, the mean absolute \ndeviation (MAD) is sometimes used as a measure of variability. The variance is the preferred measure for several \nreasons. First, working with absolute deviations is mathematically more difficult. Second, squaring deviations gives more weight to larger deviations. In investments, giving more weight to large deviations (hence, losses) is compatible with risk aversion. Third, when returns are normally distributed, the variance is one of the two param-eters that fully characterize the distribution.  You can compute the first expression,  E ( r  2 ), in Equation 7B.6 using Excel\u2019s SUM-\nPRODUCT function. For example, in  Spreadsheet 7B.3 ,  E ( r  2 ) is first calculated in \ncell C21 by using SUMPRODUCT to multiply the scenario probability times the \nasset return times the asset return again. Then [ E ( r )] 2  is subtracted (notice the sub-\ntraction of C20 2  in cell C21), to arrive at variance.

This is easi-\nest seen through a numerical example. \n Imagine a three-scenario analysis of stocks and bonds as given in  Spreadsheet 7B.4 . In \n scenario 1, bonds go down (negative deviation) while stocks go up (positive deviation). In  scenario 3, bonds are up, but stocks are down. When the rates move in opposite directions, as in this case, the product of the deviations is negative; conversely, if the rates moved in the same direction, the sign of the product would be positive. The magnitude of the product shows the extent of the opposite or common movement in that scenario. The probability-weighted aver-age of these products therefore summarizes the  average  tendency for the variables to co-vary \nacross scenarios. In the last line of the spreadsheet, we see that the covariance is  2 80 (cell H6). \n Suppose our scenario analysis had envisioned stocks generally moving in the same direction \nas bonds. To be concrete, let\u2019s switch the forecast rates on stocks in the first and third scenarios, that is, let the stock return be  2 10% in the first scenario and 30% in the third. In this case, the \nabsolute value of both products of these scenarios remains the same, but the signs are positive, and thus the covariance is positive, at  1 80, reflecting the tendency for both asset returns to vary \nin tandem. If the levels of the scenario returns change, the intensity of the covariation also may change, as reflected by the magnitude of the product of deviations. The change in the magni-tude of the covariance quantifies the change in both direction and intensity of the covariation. \n If there is no comovement at all, because positive and negative products are equally \nlikely, the covariance is zero. Also, if one of the assets is risk-free, its covariance with any risky asset is zero, because its deviations from its mean are identically zero. \n The computation of covariance using Excel can be made easy by using the last line in \nEquation 7B.9. The first term,  E ( r  \n D  \u00a0 3 \u00a0 r   E  ), can be computed in one stroke using Excel\u2019s \nSUMPRODUCT function. Specifically, in  Spreadsheet 7B.4 , SUMPRODUCT(A3:A5, \nB3:B5, C3:C5) multiplies the probability times the return on debt times the return on equity in each scenario and then sums those three products. \n Notice that adding D to each rate would not change the covariance because deviations \nfrom the mean would remain unchanged. But if you  multiply  either of the variables by a \nfixed factor, the covariance will increase by that factor. Multiplying both variables results in a covariance multiplied by the products of the factors because   \n  Cov (w\nDrD, wErE)5E53wDrD2wDE(rD)43wErE2wEE(rE)46  (7B.10)  \n5wDwE Cov (rD, rE)\nThe covariance in Equation 7B.10 is actually the term that we add (twice) in the last line of \nthe equation for portfolio variance, Equation 7B.8. So we find that portfolio variance is the weighted sum (not average) of the individual asset variances,  plus  twice their covariance \nweighted by the two portfolio weights ( w  \n D  \u00a0 3 \u00a0 w   E  ). \n Like variance, the dimension (unit) of covariance is percent squared. But here we can-\nnot get to a more easily interpreted dimension by taking the square root, because the aver-\nage product of deviations can be negative, as it was in  Spreadsheet 7B.4 . The solution in this case is to scale the covariance by the standard deviations of the two variables, produc-ing the  correlation coefficient.

We define correlation as follows:   \n Corr (rD, rE)5Cov(rD, rE)\nsDsE  (7B.11)  \nThe correlation coefficient must fall within the range [ 2 1,\u00a01]. This can be explained as \nfollows. What two variables should have the highest degree comovement?

(Check this \nfor yourself by finding the correlation of a variable with its own negative.) \n An important property of the correlation coefficient is that it is unaffected by both \naddition and multiplication. Suppose we start with a return on debt,  r   D  , multiply it \nby a constant,  w   D  , and then add a fixed amount D .

First, the model requires a huge number of estimates to fill the covariance matrix. Second, the model does not provide any guideline to the forecasting of the secu-rity risk premiums that are essential to con-struct the efficient frontier of risky assets. Because past returns are unreliable guides to expected future returns, this drawback can be telling. \n In this chapter we introduce index mod-\nels that simplify estimation of the covari-\nance matrix and greatly enhance the analysis of security risk premiums. By allowing us to explicitly decompose risk into systematic and firm-specific components, these models also shed considerable light on both the power and the limits of diversification. Further, they allow us to measure these components of risk for particular securities and portfolios. \n We begin the chapter by describing a \n single-factor security market and show how \nit can justify a single-index model of security returns. Once its properties are analyzed, we proceed to an extensive example of estima-tion of the single-index model. We review the statistical properties of these estimates and show how they relate to the practical issues facing portfolio managers. \n Despite the simplification they offer, \nindex models remain true to the concepts \nof the efficient frontier and portfolio opti-mization. Empirically, index models are as valid as the assumption of normality of the rates of return on available securities. To the extent that short-term returns are well approximated by normal distributions, index models can be used to select optimal port-folios nearly as accurately as the Markowitz algorithm. Finally, we examine optimal risky portfolios constructed using the index model. While the principles are the same as those employed in the previous chapter, the properties of the portfolio are easier to derive and interpret in this context. We illustrate how to use the index model by con-structing an optimal risky portfolio using a small sample of firms. This portfolio is com-pared to the corresponding portfolio con-structed from the Markowitz model. We conclude with a discussion of several practi-cal issues that arise when implementing the index model.

In the long run, effi-cient portfolios will beat portfolios with less reliable input lists and consequently inferior reward-to-risk trade-offs. \n Suppose your security analysts can thoroughly analyze 50 stocks. This means that your \ninput list will include the following:\n    n 5 50 estimates of expected returns\n n5\n50 estimates of variances\n (n22n)/251,225  estimates of covariances\n 1,325 total estimates  \n This is a formidable task, particularly in light of the fact that a 50-security portfolio \nis relatively small. Doubling  n  to 100 will nearly quadruple the number of estimates to \n5,150. If  n \u00a0 5 \u00a03,000, roughly the number of NYSE stocks, we need more than 4.5  million  \nestimates. \n Another difficulty in applying the Markowitz model to portfolio optimization is that \nerrors in the assessment or estimation of correlation coefficients can lead to nonsensical \nresults. This can happen because some sets of correlation coefficients are mutually incon-sistent, as the following example demonstrates:  \n1    \nAssetStandard \nDeviation (%)Correlation Matrix\nABC\nA 20 1.00 0.90 0.90\nB 20 0.90 1.00 0.00\nC 20 0.90 0.00 1.00\n Suppose that you construct a portfolio with weights  2 1.00; 1.00; 1.00, for assets A; B; C, \nrespectively, and calculate the portfolio variance. You will find that the portfolio  v ariance \nappears to be negative ( 2 200). This of course is not possible because portfolio \nvariances cannot be negative: We conclude that the inputs in the estimated correlation matrix must be mutually inconsistent. Of course,  true  correlation coefficients are always consistent.  \n2   \nBut we do not know these true correlations and can only estimate them with some impreci-sion. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine at a quick glance whether a correlation matrix is inconsistent, providing another motivation to seek a model that is easier to implement.\n \n Introducing a model that simplifies the way we describe the sources of security risk \nallows us to use a smaller, consistent set of estimates of risk parameters and risk pre-miums. The simplification emerges because positive covariances among security returns arise from common economic forces that affect the fortunes of most firms. Some examples of common economic factors are business cycles, interest rates, and the cost of natural resources. The unexpected changes in these variables cause, simultaneously, unexpected     8.1 A Single-Factor Security Market \n  1 We are grateful to Andrew Kaplin and Ravi Jagannathan, Kellogg Graduate School of Management,  \nNorthwestern University, for this example. \n   2 The mathematical term for a correlation matrix that cannot generate negative portfolio variance is \u201cpositive \ndefinite.\u201d  \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   257bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   257 6/21/13   4:09 PM6/21/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\n258 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nchanges in the rates of return on the entire stock market. By decomposing uncertainty into \nthese  systemwide versus firm-specific sources, we vastly simplify the problem of estimat-ing covariance and correlation.  \n  Normality of Returns and Systematic Risk \n We can always decompose the rate of return on any security,  i,  into the sum of its expected \nplus unanticipated components:\n    ri5E(ri)1ei  (8.1)  \nwhere the unexpected return,  e   i  , has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of  s   i   that \nmeasures the uncertainty about the security return. \n When security returns can be well approximated by normal distributions that are cor-\nrelated across securities, we say that they are  joint normally distributed.  This  assumption \nalone implies that, at any time, security returns are driven by one or more common vari-\nables. When more than one variable drives normally distributed security returns, these returns are said to have a  multivariate normal distribution.  We begin with the simpler \ncase where only one variable drives the joint normally distributed returns, resulting in a single-factor security market. Extension to the multivariate case is straightforward and is discussed in later chapters. \n Suppose the common factor,  m,  that drives innovations in security returns is some \nmacroeconomic variable that affects all firms. Then we can decompose the sources of uncertainty into uncertainty about the economy as a whole, which is captured by  m,  and \nuncertainty about the firm in particular, which is captured by  e  \n i  . In this case, we amend \nEquation 8.1 to accommodate two sources of variation in return:\n    ri5E(ri)1m1ei  (8.2)   \n The macroeconomic factor,  m,  measures unanticipated macro surprises. As such, it has \na mean of zero (over time, surprises will average out to zero), with standard deviation of \n s   m  . In contrast,  e   i   measures only the firm-specific surprise. Notice that  m  has no subscript \nbecause the same common factor affects all securities. Most important is the fact that  m  \nand  e   i   are uncorrelated, that is, because  e   i   is firm-specific, it is independent of shocks to \nthe common factor that affect the entire economy. The variance of  r   i   thus arises from two \nuncorrelated sources, systematic and firm specific. Therefore,\n    si25sm21s2(ei)  (8.3)   \n The common factor,  m,  generates correlation across securities, because all securities \nwill respond to the same macroeconomic news, while the firm-specific surprises, captured \nby  e   i  , are assumed to be uncorrelated across firms. Because  m  is also uncorrelated with any \nof the firm-specific surprises, the covariance between any two securities  i  and  j  is\n    C o v(ri, rj)5Cov(m1ei, m1ej)5sm2  (8.4)   \n Finally, we recognize that some securities will be more sensitive than others to macro-\neconomic shocks. For example, auto firms might respond more dramatically to changes in \ngeneral economic conditions than pharmaceutical firms. We can capture this refinement by assigning each firm a sensitivity coefficient to macro conditions. Therefore, if we denote the sensitivity coefficient for firm  i  by the Greek letter beta,  b  \n i  , we modify Equation 8.2 to \nobtain the    single-factor model:   \n    ri5E(ri)1bim1ei  (8.5)   \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   258bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   258 6/21/13   4:09 PM6/21/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 8 Index Models 259\n  3 Practitioners often use a \u201cmodified\u201d index model that is similar to Equation 8.8 but that uses total rather than \nexcess returns. This practice is most common when daily data are used. In this case the rate of return on bills is on \nthe order of only about .01% per day, so total and excess returns are almost indistinguishable.  Equation 8.5 tells us the systematic risk of security  i  is determined by its beta coefficient. \n\u201cCyclical\u201d firms have greater sensitivity to the market and therefore higher systematic risk. \nThe systematic risk of security  i  is    b i2sm2,  and its total risk is\n    si25bi2sm21s2(ei)  (8.6)  \nThe covariance between any pair of securities also is determined by their betas:\n    C o v(ri, rj)5Cov(bim1ei, bjm1ej)5bibjsm2  (8.7)  \nIn terms of systematic risk and market exposure, this equation tells us that firms are close \nsubstitutes. Equivalent beta securities give equivalent market exposures. \n Up to this point we have used only statistical implications from the joint normality of \nsecurity returns. Normality of security returns alone guarantees that portfolio returns are also normal (from the \u201cstability\u201d of the normal distribution discussed in Chapter 5) and that there is a linear relationship between security returns and the common factor. This greatly simplifies portfolio analysis. Statistical analysis, however, does not identify the common factor, nor does it specify how that factor might operate over a longer investment period. However, it seems plausible (and can be empirically verified) that the variance of the com-mon factor usually changes relatively slowly through time, as do the variances of indi-vidual securities and the covariances among them. We seek a variable that can proxy for this common factor. To be useful, this variable must be observable, so we can estimate its volatility as well as the sensitivity of individual securities returns to variation in its value.    \n   8.2 The Single-Index Model \n  A reasonable approach to making the single-factor model operational is to assert that the rate of return on a broad index of securities such as the S&P 500 is a valid proxy for the common macroeconomic factor. This approach leads to an equation similar to the single-factor model, which is called a    single-index model    because it uses the market index to \nproxy for the common factor.  \n   The Regression Equation of the Single-Index Model \n Because rates of return on market indexes such as the S&P 500 can be observed, we have a considerable amount of past data with which to estimate systematic risk. We denote the market index by  M,  with excess return of  R  \n M  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 r   M  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f   , and standard deviation of  s   M  . \nBecause the index model is linear, we can estimate the sensitivity (or beta) coefficient of a \nsecurity on the index using a single-variable linear regression. We regress the excess return of a security,  R  \n i  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 r   i  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f   , on the excess return of the index,  R   M  . To estimate the regression, \nwe collect a historical sample of paired observations,  R   i  ( t ) and  R   M  ( t ), where  t  denotes the \ndate of each pair of observations (e.g., the excess returns on the stock and the index in a \nparticular month).  3   The    regression equation    is \n    Ri(t)5ai1biRM(t)1ei(t)  (8.8)  \nThe intercept of this equation (denoted by the Greek letter alpha, or  a ) is the security\u2019s \nexpected excess return  when the market excess return is zero.  The slope coefficient,  b   i  , is \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   259bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   259 6/21/13   4:09 PM6/21/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\n260 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nthe security beta. Beta is the security\u2019s sensitivity to the index: It is the amount by which the \nsecurity return tends to increase or decrease for every 1% increase or decrease in the return on the index.  e  \n i   is the zero-mean, firm-specific surprise in the security return in time\u00a0  t,  \nalso called the    residual.     \n  The Expected Return\u2013Beta Relationship \n Because  E  ( e   i  )\u00a0 5 \u00a00, if we take the expected value of  E ( R   i  ) in Equation 8.8, we obtain the \nexpected return\u2013beta relationship of the single-index model:\n    E(Ri)5ai1biE(RM)  (8.9)   \n The second term in Equation 8.9 tells us that part of a security\u2019s risk premium is due to the \nrisk premium of the index. The market risk premium is multiplied by the relative sensitiv-ity, or beta, of the individual security. We call this the  systematic  risk premium because it \nderives from the risk premium that characterizes the entire market, which proxies for the condition of the full economy or economic system. \n The remainder of the risk premium is given by the first term in the equation,  a . Alpha is \na  nonmarket  premium. For example,  a  may be large if you think a security is underpriced \nand therefore offers an attractive expected return. Later on, we will see that when secu-rity prices are in equilibrium, such attractive opportunities ought to be competed away, in which case  a  will be driven to zero. But for now, let\u2019s assume that each security analyst \ncomes up with his or her own estimates of alpha. If managers believe that they can do a superior job of security analysis, then they will be confident in their ability to find stocks with nonzero values of alpha. \n We will see shortly that the index model decomposition of an individual security\u2019s risk \npremium to market and nonmarket components greatly clarifies and simplifies the opera-tion of macroeconomic and security analysis within an investment company.  \n  Risk and Covariance in the Single-Index Model \n Remember that one of the problems with the Markowitz model is the overwhelming  number of parameter estimates required to implement it. Now we will see that the index model simplification vastly reduces the number of parameters that must be estimated. Equation 8.8 yields the systematic and firm-specific components of the overall risk of each security, and the covariance between any pair of securities. Both variances and covariances are determined by the security betas and the properties of the market index:\n    Total risk 5S\nystematic risk 1Firm-specific risk\n si25bi2sM21s2(ei)\n Covariance 5Product of betas 3 Market-index risk\n  Cov (ri, rj)5bibjsM2  (8.10)\n Correlation 5Product of correlations with the market index\n Corr (ri, rj)5bibjsM2\nsisj5bisM2bjsM2\nsisMsjsM5Corr (ri, rM)3Corr (rj, rM)    \n Equations 8.9 and 8.10 imply that the set of parameter estimates needed for the single-\nindex model consists of only  a ,\u00a0 b , and  s ( e ) for the individual securities, plus the risk pre-\nmium and variance of the market index.   \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   260bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   260 6/21/13   4:09 PM6/21/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 8 Index Models 261\n  The Set of Estimates Needed for the Single-Index Model \n We summarize the results for the single-index model in the table below.

Thus for a 50-security portfolio we will need 152 estimates rather \nthan 1,325; for the entire New York Stock Exchange, about 3,000 securities, we will need 9,002 estimates rather than approximately 4.5 million! \n It is easy to see why the index model is such a useful abstraction. For large universes of \nsecurities, the number of estimates required for the Markowitz procedure using the index model is only a small fraction of what otherwise would be needed. \n Another advantage is less obvious but equally important. The index model abstraction \nis crucial for specialization of effort in security analysis. If a covariance term had to be \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   261bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   261 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n262 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\ncalculated directly for each security pair, then security analysts could not specialize by \nindustry. For example, if one group were to specialize in the computer industry and another in the auto industry, who would have the common background to estimate the covariance  between  IBM and GM? Neither group would have the deep understanding of other indus-\ntries necessary to make an informed judgment of co-movements among industries. In con-trast, the index model suggests a simple way to compute covariances. Covariances among securities are due to the influence of the single common factor, represented by the market index return, and can be easily estimated using the regression Equation 8.8. \n The simplification derived from the index model assumption is, however, not without \ncost. The \u201ccost\u201d of the model lies in the restrictions it places on the structure of asset return uncertainty. The classification of uncertainty into a simple dichotomy\u2014macro ver-sus micro risk\u2014oversimplifies sources of real-world uncertainty and misses some impor-tant sources of dependence in stock returns. For example, this dichotomy rules out industry events, events that may affect many firms within an industry without substantially affect-ing the broad macroeconomy. \n This last point is potentially important. Imagine that the single-index model is  perfectly \naccurate, except that the residuals of two stocks, say, British Petroleum (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, are correlated. The index model will ignore this correlation (it will assume it is zero), while the Markowitz algorithm (which accounts for the full covariance between every pair of stocks) will automatically take the residual correlation into account when minimizing portfolio variance. If the universe of securities from which we must construct the optimal portfolio is small, the two models will yield substantively different optimal portfolios. The portfolio of the Markowitz algorithm will place a smaller weight on both BP and Shell (because their mutual covariance reduces their diversification value), result-ing in a portfolio with lower variance. Conversely, when correlation among   residuals \nis  negative, the index model will ignore the potential diversification value of these securities. The resulting \u201coptimal\u201d  portfolio will place too little weight on these securities, resulting in an unnecessarily high variance. \n \n The optimal portfolio derived from the single-index \nmodel therefore can be significantly inferior to that of the full-covariance (Markowitz) model when stocks with correlated residuals have large alpha values and account for a large fraction of the portfolio. If many pairs of the covered stocks exhibit residual correlation, it is possible that a  multi-index  model, which includes additional fac-\ntors to capture those extra sources of cross-security cor-relation, would be better suited for portfolio analysis and construction. We will demonstrate the effect of correlated residuals in the spreadsheet example in this chapter, and discuss multi-index models in later chapters.  \n  The Index Model and Diversification \n The index model, first suggested by Sharpe,  4   also offers insight into portfolio diversifica-\ntion. Suppose that we choose an equally weighted portfolio of  n  securities. The excess rate \nof return on each security is given by \n   Ri5ai1biRM1ei  Suppose that the index model for the excess \nreturns of stocks  A  and  B  is estimated with the \nfollowing results:\n    RA51.0%1.9RM1eA\n RB522.0%11.1R M1eB\n sM520%\n s(eA)530%\n s(eB)510%   \n Find the standard deviation of each stock and \nthe covariance between them.

This part of the risk is diversified away. In contrast, market risk remains, regardless of the number of firms combined into the portfolio. \n To understand these results, note that the excess rate of return on this equally weighted \nportfolio, for which each portfolio weight  w  \n i  \u00a0 5 \u00a01/ n,  is\n    RP5an\ni51wiRi51\nnan\ni51Ri51\nnan\ni51(ai1biRM1ei)\n  51\nnan\ni51ai1a1\nnan\ni51bibRM11\nnan\ni51ei  (8.12)   \n Comparing Equations 8.11 and 8.12, we see that the portfolio has a sensitivity to the \nmarket given by\n    bP51\nnan\ni51bi  (8.13)  \nwhich is the average of the individual  b   i   s.  It has a nonmarket return component of\n    aP51\nnan\ni51ai  (8.14)  \nwhich is the average of the individual alphas, plus the zero mean variable\n    eP51\nnan\ni51ei  (8.15)  \nwhich is the average of the firm-specific components. Hence the portfolio\u2019s variance is\n    sP25bP2sM21s2(eP)  (8.16)   \n The systematic risk component of the portfolio variance, which we defined as the compo-\nnent that depends on marketwide movements, is    bP2sM2  and depends on the sensitivity coef-\nficients of the individual securities. This part of the risk depends on portfolio beta and    sM2  and \nwill persist regardless of the extent of portfolio diversification. No matter how many stocks \nare held, their common exposure to the market will be reflected in portfolio systematic risk.  5    \n In contrast, the nonsystematic component of the portfolio variance is  s  2 ( e   P  ) and is \nattributable to firm-specific components,  e   i  . Because these  e   i  s are independent, and all \nhave zero expected value, the law of averages can be applied to conclude that as more and \nmore stocks are added to the portfolio, the firm-specific components tend to cancel out, resulting in ever-smaller nonmarket risk. Such risk is thus termed  diversifiable.  To see this \nmore rigorously, examine the formula for the variance of the equally weighted \u201cportfolio\u201d of firm-specific components. Because the  e  \n i  s are uncorrelated,\n s2(eP)5an\ni51a1\nnb2\ns2(ei)51\nn s\u20132(e)   (8.17)   \n where s\u20132(e)   is the average of the firm-specific variances. Because this average is indepen-\ndent of  n,  when  n  gets large,  s  2 ( e   P  ) becomes negligible. \n  5 One can construct a portfolio with zero systematic risk by mixing negative  b  and positive  b  assets. The point of \nour discussion is that the vast majority of securities have a positive  b , implying that well-diversified portfolios \nwith small holdings in large numbers of assets will indeed have positive systematic risk. \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   263bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   263 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2 6 4 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n To summarize, as diversification increases, the total variance of a portfolio approaches \nthe systematic variance, defined as the variance of the market factor multiplied by the \nsquare of the portfolio sensitivity coefficient,    bP2.  This is shown in  Figure\u00a08.1 .  \n  Figure\u00a08.1  shows that as more and more securities are combined into a portfolio, the \nportfolio variance decreases because of the diversification of firm-specific risk. However, \nthe power of diversification is limited. Even for very large  n,  part of the risk remains \nbecause of the exposure of virtually all assets to the com-\nmon, or market, factor. Therefore, this systematic risk is \nsaid to be nondiversifiable.  \n This analysis is borne out by empirical evidence. We \nsaw the effect of portfolio diversification on portfolio \nstandard deviations in Figure 7.2.

As a first step, the excess \nreturns on the seven risky assets are computed. We start with a detailed look at the prepara-\ntion of the input list for Hewlett-Packard (HP), and then proceed to display the entire input \nlist. Later in the chapter, we will show how these estimates can be used to construct the \noptimal risky portfolio.  \n   The Security Characteristic Line for Hewlett-Packard \n The index model regression Equation 8.8 restated for Hewlett-Packard (HP) is\nRHP(t)\u00a05\u00a0aHP\u00a01\u00a0bHPRS&P500 (t)\u00a01\u00a0eHP(t)\nThe equation describes the (linear) dependence of HP\u2019s excess return on changes in the \nstate of the economy as represented by the excess returns of the S&P 500 index portfolio. \nThe regression estimates describe a straight line with intercept  a  HP  and slope  b  HP , which \nwe call the    security characteristic line    (SCL) for HP. \n  Figure\u00a08.2  shows a graph of the excess returns on HP and the S&P 500 portfolio over \nthe 60-month period. The graph shows that HP returns generally follow those of the index, \nbut with much larger swings. Indeed, the annualized standard deviation of the excess return \non the S&P 500 portfolio over the period was 13.58%, while that of HP was 38.17%. The \nswings in HP\u2019s excess returns suggest a greater-than-average sensitivity to the index, that \nis, a beta greater than 1.0.  \n The relationship between the returns of HP and the S&P 500 is made clearer by the \n  scatter diagram    in  Figure\u00a08.3 , where the regression line is drawn through the scatter. The \nvertical distance of each point from the regression line is the value of HP\u2019s residual,  e  HP ( t ), \ncorresponding to that particular month. The rates in  Figure\u00a08.2  are not annualized, and \nthe scatter diagram shows monthly swings of over  6  30% for HP, but returns in the range \nof  2 11% to 8.5% for the S&P 500. The \nregression analysis output obtained by \nusing Excel is shown in  Table 8.1 .    \n  The Explanatory Power \nof the SCL for HP \n Considering the top panel of  Table 8.1  \nfirst, we see that the correlation of HP \nwith the S&P 500 is quite high (.7238), \ntelling us that HP tracks changes in the \nreturns of the S&P 500 fairly closely. The \n R -square (.5239) tells us that variation in \nthe S&P 500 excess returns explains about \n52% of the variation in the HP series. \nThe adjusted  R -square (which is slightly \nsmaller) corrects for an upward bias in \n R -square that arises because we use the \nfitted values of two parameters,  6   the slope \n6 In general, the adjusted  R -square    (RA2)  is derived from the unadjusted by    RA2512(12R2) n21\nn2k21,  where  k\nis the number of independent variables (here,  k \u00a05\u00a01).

With \n60 observations, this bias is small. The \nstandard error of the regression is the \nstandard deviation of the residual, which \nwe discuss in more detail shortly. This is \na measure of the slippage in the average \nrelationship between the stock and the \nindex due to the impact of firm-specific \nfactors, and is based on  in-sample   data. \nA more severe test is to look at returns \nfrom periods after the one covered by the \nregression sample and test the power of \nthe independent variable (the S&P\u00a0500) \nto predict the dependent variable (the \nreturn on HP). Correlation between \nregression forecasts and realizations \nof  out-of-sample   data is almost always \nconsiderably lower than in-sample \ncorrelation.   \n  Analysis of Variance \n The next panel of  Table 8.1  shows the \nanalysis of variance (ANOV A) for the \nSCL. The sum of squares (SS) of the regression (.3752) is the portion of the variance of \nthe dependent variable (HP\u2019s return) that is explained by the independent variable (the S&P \n500 return); it is equal to    bHP2sS&P 5002.

In general, if we standardize the \nestimate of a normally distributed variable by computing its difference from a hypothesized value and dividing \nby the standard error of the estimate (to express the difference as a number of standard errors), the resulting vari-able will have a  t -distribution. With a large number of observations, the bell-shaped  t -distribution approaches the \nnormal distribution.  you will obtain the estimate of the variance of the dependent variable (HP), .012 per month, \nequivalent to a monthly  standard deviation of 11%. When it is annualized,  7   we obtain an annu-\nalized standard  deviation of 38.17%, as reported earlier. Notice that the  R -square (the ratio of \nexplained to total  variance) equals the explained (regression) SS divided by the total SS.  8     \n  The Estimate of Alpha \n We move to the bottom panel. The intercept (.0086\u00a0 5 \u00a0.86% per month) is the estimate of \nHP\u2019s alpha for the sample period. Although this is an economically large value (10.32% on an annual basis), it is statistically insignificant. This can be seen from the three statistics next to the estimated coefficient. The first is the standard error of the estimate (0.0099).  \n9   \nThis is a measure of the imprecision of the estimate. If the standard error is large, the range of likely estimation error is correspondingly large. \n The  t -statistic reported in the bottom panel is the ratio of the regression parameter to its \nstandard error. This statistic equals the number of standard errors by which our estimate exceeds zero, and therefore can be used to assess the likelihood that the true but unob-served value might actually equal zero rather than the estimate derived from the data.  \n10   \nThe intuition is that if the true value were zero, we would be unlikely to observe estimated values far away (i.e., many standard errors) from zero. So large  t -statistics imply low prob-\nabilities that the true value is zero.\n \n In the case of alpha, we are interested in the average value of HP\u2019s return net of the \nimpact of market movements. Suppose we define the nonmarket component of HP\u2019s return as its actual return minus the return attributable to market movements during any period. Call this HP\u2019s firm-specific return, which we abbreviate as  R  \n fs  .\n   Rfirm-specific 5Rfs5RHP2bHPRS&P500   \n If  R   fs   were normally distributed with a mean of zero, the ratio of its estimate to its \nstandard error would have a  t -distribution. From a table of the  t -distribution (or using \nExcel\u2019s TINV function) we can find the probability that the true alpha is actually zero \nor even lower given the positive estimate of its value and the standard error of the esti-mate. This is called the  level of significance  or, as in  Table 8.1 , the probability or  p-value.   \nThe conventional cutoff for statistical significance is a probability of less than 5%, which requires a   t -statistic of about 2.0. The regression output shows the  t -statistic for HP\u2019s alpha \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   267bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   267 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n268 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nto be .8719, indicating that the estimate is not significantly different from zero. That is, \nwe  cannot reject the hypothesis that the true value of alpha equals zero with an accept-able level of confidence. The  p -value for the alpha estimate (.3868) indicates that if the \ntrue alpha were zero, the probability of obtaining an estimate as high as .0086 (given the large standard error of .0099) would be .3868, which is not so unlikely. We conclude that the sample average of  R  \n fs   is too low to reject the hypothesis that the true value of alpha is zero. \n But even if the alpha value were both economically  and  statistically significant  within \nthe sample,  we still would not use that alpha as a forecast for a future period. Overwhelming \nempirical evidence shows that 5-year alpha values do not persist over time, that is, there seems to be virtually no correlation between estimates from one sample period to the next. In other words, while the alpha estimated from the regression tells us the average return on the security when the market was flat during that estimation period, it does  not  forecast \nwhat the firm\u2019s performance will be in future periods. This is why security analysis is so hard. The past does not readily foretell the future. We elaborate on this issue in Chapter 11 on market efficiency.  \n  The Estimate of Beta \n The regression output in  Table 8.1  shows the beta estimate for HP to be 2.0348, more than twice that of the S&P 500. Such high market sensitivity is not unusual for technology stocks. The standard error (SE) of the estimate is .2547.  \n11    \n The value of beta and its SE produce a large  t -statistic (7.9888), and a  p -value of prac-\ntically zero. We can confidently reject the hypothesis that HP\u2019s true beta is zero. A more interesting  t -statistic might test a null hypothesis that HP\u2019s beta is greater than the market-\nwide average beta of 1. This  t -statistic would measure how many standard errors separate \nthe estimated beta from a hypothesized value of 1. Here too, the difference is easily large enough to achieve statistical significance:\n   Estimated value 2Hypothesized value\nStandard error52.0321\n.254754.00  \n However, we should bear in mind that even here, precision is not what we might like it to be. For example, if we wanted to construct a confidence interval that includes the true but unobserved value of beta with 95% probability, we would take the estimated value as the center of the interval and then add and subtract about two standard errors. This produces a range between 1.43 and 2.53, which is quite wide.  \n  Firm-Specific Risk \n The monthly standard deviation of HP\u2019s residual is 7.67%, or 26.6% annually. This is quite large, on top of HP\u2019s already high systematic risk. The standard deviation of systematic risk is  b \u00a0 3 \u00a0 s  (S&P\u00a0500)\u00a0 5 \u00a02.03\u00a0 3 \u00a013.58\u00a0 5 \u00a027.57%. Notice that HP\u2019s firm-specific risk is \nas large as its systematic risk, a common result for individual stocks.  \n  Correlation and Covariance Matrix \n  Figure\u00a08.4  graphs the excess returns of the pairs of securities from each of the three sectors with the S&P 500 index on the same scale. We see that the IT sector is the most variable, followed by the retail sector, and then the energy sector, which has the lowest volatility.  \n Panel 1 in  Spreadsheet\u00a08.1  shows the estimates of the risk parameters of the S&P 500 \nportfolio and the six analyzed securities.

In fact, a few of the stocks in this sample actu-ally seem to have negatively correlated residuals. Of course, correlation also is subject to statistical sampling error, and this may be a fluke. \n Panel 3 produces covariances derived from Equation 8.10 of the single-index model. \nVariances of the S&P 500 index and the individual covered stocks appear on the diagonal.

The off-diagonal \nterms are covariance values and equal    bibjsM2.      \n   8.4 Portfolio Construction and the Single-Index Model \n  In this section, we look at the implications of the index model for portfolio construction.  12   \nWe will see that the model offers several advantages, not only in terms of parameter \nestimation, but also for the analytic simplification and organizational decentralization that it makes possible.   \n   Alpha and Security Analysis \n Perhaps the most important advantage of the single-index model is the framework it pro-vides for macroeconomic and security analysis in the preparation of the input list that is so critical to the efficiency of the optimal portfolio. The Markowitz model requires estimates of risk premiums for each security. The estimate of expected return depends on both mac-roeconomic and individual-firm forecasts. But if many different analysts perform security analysis for a large organization such as a mutual fund company, a likely result is incon-sistency in the macroeconomic forecasts that partly underlie expectations of returns across securities. Moreover, the underlying assumptions for market-index risk and return often are not explicit in the analysis of individual securities. \n The single-index model creates a framework that separates these two quite different sources \nof return variation and makes it easier to ensure consistency across analysts. We can lay down a hierarchy of the preparation of the input list using the framework of the single-index model. \n    1. Macroeconomic analysis is used to estimate the risk premium and risk of the \n market index.  \n   2. Statistical analysis is used to estimate the beta coefficients of all securities and their \nresidual variances,  s  \n2 ( e   i  ).  \n   3. The portfolio manager uses the estimates for the market-index risk premium and \nthe beta coefficient of a security to establish the expected return of that security \n absent  any contribution from security analysis. The market-driven expected return \nis conditional on information common to all securities, not on information gleaned from security analysis of particular firms. This market-driven expected return can be used as a benchmark.  \n   4. Security-specific expected return forecasts (specifically, security alphas) are derived \nfrom various security-valuation models (such as those discussed in Part Five). Thus, the alpha value distills the  incremental  risk premium attributable to private informa-\ntion developed from security analysis.   \n  12 The use of the index model to construct optimal risky portfolios was originally developed in Jack Treynor and \nFischer Black, \u201cHow to Use Security Analysis to Improve Portfolio Selection,\u201d  Journal of Business,  January 1973. \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   271bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   271 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n272 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n In the context of Equation 8.9, the risk premium on a security not subject to security \nanalysis would be  b   i   E ( R   M  ). In other words, the risk premium would derive solely from the \nsecurity\u2019s tendency to follow the market index. Any expected return beyond this bench-\nmark risk premium (the security alpha) would be due to some nonmarket factor that would be uncovered through security analysis. \n The end result of security analysis is the list of alpha values. Statistical methods of esti-\nmating beta coefficients are widely known and standardized; hence, we would not expect this portion of the input list to differ greatly across portfolio managers. In contrast, macro and security analysis are far less of an exact science and therefore provide an arena for dis-tinguished performance. Using the index model to disentangle the premiums due to market and nonmarket factors, a portfolio manager can be confident that macro analysts compiling estimates of the market-index risk premium and security analysts compiling alpha values are using consistent estimates for the overall market. \n In the context of portfolio construction, alpha is more than just one of the components \nof expected return. It is the key variable that tells us whether a security is a good or a bad buy. Consider an individual stock for which we have a beta estimate from statistical considerations and an alpha value from security analysis. We easily can find many other securities with identical betas and therefore identical systematic components of their risk premiums. Therefore, what really makes a security attractive or unattractive to a portfolio manager is its alpha value. In fact, we\u2019ve suggested that a security with a positive alpha is providing a premium over and above the premium it derives from its tendency to track the market index. This security is a bargain and therefore should be overweighted in the over-all portfolio compared to the passive alternative of using the market-index portfolio as the risky vehicle. Conversely, a negative-alpha security is overpriced and, other things equal, its portfolio weight should be reduced. In more extreme cases, the desired portfolio weight might even be negative, that is, a short position (if permitted) would be desirable.  \n  The Index Portfolio as an Investment Asset \n The process of charting the efficient frontier using the single-index model can be pursued much like the procedure we used in Chapter 7, where we used the Markowitz model to find the optimal risky portfolio. Here, however, we can benefit from the simplification the index model offers for deriving the input list. Moreover, portfolio optimization highlights another advantage of the single-index model, namely, a simple and intuitively revealing representation of the optimal risky portfolio. Before we get into the mechanics of optimization in this setting, however, we start by considering the role of the index portfolio in the optimal portfolio. \n Suppose the prospectus of an investment company limits the universe of investable \nassets to only stocks included in the S&P 500 portfolio. In this case, the S&P 500 index captures the impact of the economy on the large stocks the firm may include in its portfolio. Suppose that the resources of the company allow coverage of only a relatively small subset of this so-called  investable universe.  If these analyzed firms are the only ones allowed in \nthe portfolio, the portfolio manager may well be worried about limited diversification. \n A simple way to avoid inadequate diversification is to include the S&P 500 portfolio as \none of the assets of the portfolio. Examination of Equations 8.8 and 8.9 reveals that if we treat the S&P 500 portfolio as the market index, it will have a beta of 1.0 (its sensitivity to itself), no firm-specific risk, and an alpha of zero\u2014there is no nonmarket component in its expected return. Equation 8.10 shows that the covariance of any security,  i,  with the index \nis    b\nisM2.  To distinguish the S&P 500 from the  n  securities covered by the firm, we will \ndesignate it the ( n \u00a0 1 \u00a01)th asset. We can think of the S&P 500 as a  passive portfolio  that the \nmanager would select in the absence of security analysis. It gives broad market  exposure \nwithout the need for expensive security analysis. However, if the manager is willing to \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   272bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   272 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 8 Index Models 273\nengage in such research, she may devise an  active portfolio  that can be mixed with the \nindex to provide an even better risk\u2013return trade-off.  \n  The Single-Index-Model Input List \n If the portfolio manager plans to compile a portfolio from a list of  n  actively researched firms \nplus a passive market-index portfolio, the input list will include the following estimates:\n    1. Risk premium on the S&P 500 portfolio.  \n   2. Standard deviation of the S&P 500 portfolio.     3.  n  sets of estimates of (a) beta coefficients, (b) stock residual variances, and \n(c)\u00a0alpha values. (The alpha values, together with the risk premium of the S&P \n500 and the beta of each security, determine the expected return on each security.)     \n  The Optimal Risky Portfolio in the Single-Index Model \n The single-index model allows us to solve for the optimal risky portfolio directly and to gain insight into the nature of the solution. First we confirm that we easily can set up the optimization process to chart the efficient frontier in this framework along the lines of the Markowitz model. \n With the estimates of the beta and alpha coefficients, plus the risk premium of the \nindex portfolio, we can generate the  n \u00a0 1 \u00a0 1 expected returns using Equation 8.9. With \nthe estimates of the beta coefficients and residual variances, together with the variance of the index portfolio, we can construct the covariance matrix using Equation 8.10. Given a  column of risk premiums and the covariance matrix, we can conduct the optimization program described in Chapter 7. \n We can take the description of how diversification works in the single-index framework \nof Section 8.2 a step further. We showed earlier that the alpha, beta, and residual  variance of an equally weighted portfolio are the simple averages of those parameters across  component securities. This result is not limited to equally weighted portfolios.

Therefore, given the ratio of SD, \na higher beta implies higher correlation and smaller benefit from diversification than when  b \u00a0 5 \u00a01 in Equation 8.20. \nThis requires the modification of Equation 8.21.  At this point, as in the Markowitz procedure, we could use Excel\u2019s optimization  program \nto maximize the Sharpe ratio subject to the adding-up constraint that the portfolio weights \nsum to 1. However, this is not necessary because when returns follow the index model, the optimal portfolio can be derived explicitly, and the solution for the optimal portfolio provides insight into the efficient use of security analysis in portfolio construction. It is instructive to outline the logical thread of the solution. We will not show every algebraic step, but will instead present the major results and interpretation of the procedure. \n Before delving into the results, let us first explain the basic trade-off the model reveals. \nIf we were interested only in diversification, we would just hold the market index. Security analysis gives us the chance to uncover securities with a nonzero alpha and to take a differ-ential position in those securities. The cost of that differential position is a departure from efficient diversification, in other words, the assumption of unnecessary firm-specific risk. The model shows us that the optimal risky portfolio trades off the search for alpha against the departure from efficient diversification. \n The optimal risky portfolio turns out to be a combination of two component portfolios: \n(1) an  active portfolio,  denoted by  A,  comprised of the  n  analyzed securities (we call this \nthe  active  portfolio because it follows from active security analysis), and (2) the market-\nindex portfolio, the ( n \u00a0 1 \u00a01)th asset we include to aid in diversification, which we call the \n passive portfolio  and denote by  M.  \n Assume first that the active portfolio has a beta of 1. In that case, the optimal weight \nin the active portfolio would be proportional to the ratio  a  \n A  / s  2 ( e   A  ). This ratio balances the \ncontribution of the active portfolio (its alpha) against its contribution to the portfolio vari-\nance (via residual variance). The analogous ratio for the index portfolio is    E(RM)/sM2,  and \nhence the initial position in the active portfolio (i.e., if its beta were 1) is\n    wA05aA\nsA2\nE(RM)\nsM2  (8.20)   \n Next, we amend this position to account for the actual beta of the active portfolio. For \nany level of    sA2,  the correlation between the active and passive portfolios is greater when \nthe beta of the active portfolio is higher. This implies less diversification benefit from the \npassive portfolio and a lower position in it. Correspondingly, the position in the active portfolio increases. The precise modification for the position in the active portfolio is:  \n13   \n    wA*5wA0\n11(12bA)wA0  (8.21)   \n Notice that when    bA51, w A*5wA0.   \n  The Information Ratio \n Equations 8.20 and 8.21 yield the optimal position in the active portfolio once we know its \nalpha, beta, and residual variance. With    wA*  in the active portfolio and    1 2wA*  invested in \nthe index portfolio, we can compute the expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe \nratio of the optimal risky portfolio. The Sharpe ratio of an optimally constructed risky port-folio will exceed that of the index portfolio (the passive strategy). The exact relationship is\nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   274bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   274 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 8 Index Models 275\n    SP25SM21BaA\ns(eA)R2\n  (8.22)   \n Equation 8.22 shows us that the contribution of the active portfolio (when held in its opti-\nmal weight,    wA* ) to the Sharpe ratio of the overall risky portfolio is determined by the ratio \nof its alpha to its residual standard deviation. This important ratio is called the     information \nratio.    It measures the extra return we can obtain from security  analysis  compared to the \nfirm-specific risk we incur when we over- or underweight securities relative to the passive market index. Equation 8.22 therefore implies that to maximize the overall Sharpe ratio, we must maximize the information ratio of the active portfolio. \n It turns out that the information ratio of the active portfolio will be maximized if we \ninvest in each security in proportion to its ratio of  a  \n i  / s  2 ( e   i  ). Scaling this ratio so that the \ntotal position in the active portfolio adds up to    wA*,  the weight in each security is\n    wi*5wA* ai\ns2(ei)\nan\ni51ai\ns2(ei)  (8.23)  \nWith this set of weights, the contribution of each security to the information ratio of the \nactive portfolio is the square of its  own  information ratio, that is,\n    BaA\ns(eA)R2\n5an\ni51Bai\ns(ei)R2\n  (8.24)   \n The model thus reveals the central role of the information ratio in efficiently taking \nadvantage of security analysis. The positive contribution of a security to the portfolio is made by its addition to the nonmarket risk premium (its alpha). Its negative impact is to increase the portfolio variance through its firm-specific risk (residual variance). \n In contrast to alpha, the market (systematic) component of the risk premium,  b  \n i   E ( R   M  ), \nis offset by the security\u2019s nondiversifiable (market) risk,    bi2sM2,  and both are driven by the \nsame beta. This trade-off is not unique to any security, as any security with the same beta \nmakes the same balanced contribution to both risk and return. Put differently, the beta of a security is neither vice nor virtue. It is a property that simultaneously affects the risk  and  \nrisk premium of a security. Hence we are concerned only with the aggregate beta of the active portfolio, rather than the beta of each individual security. \n We see from Equation 8.23 that if a security\u2019s alpha is negative, the security will assume \na short position in the optimal risky portfolio. If short positions are prohibited, a negative-alpha security would simply be taken out of the optimization program and assigned a port-folio weight of zero. As the number of securities with nonzero alpha values (or the number with positive alphas if short positions are prohibited) increases, the active portfolio will itself be better diversified and its weight in the overall risky portfolio will increase at the expense of the passive index portfolio. \n Finally, we note that the index portfolio is an efficient portfolio only if all alpha values \nare zero. This makes intuitive sense. Unless security analysis reveals that a security has a nonzero alpha, including it in the active portfolio would make the portfolio less attractive. In addition to the security\u2019s systematic risk, which is compensated for by the market risk premium (through beta), the security would add its firm-specific risk to portfolio variance. With a zero alpha, however, the latter is not compensated by an addition to the nonmarket risk premium. Hence, if all securities have zero alphas, the optimal weight in the active portfolio will be zero, and the weight in the index portfolio will be 1. However, when \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   275bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   275 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n276 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nsecurity analysis uncovers securities with nonmarket risk premiums (nonzero alphas), the \nindex portfolio is no longer efficient.  \n  Summary of Optimization Procedure \n Once security analysis is complete, the optimal risky portfolio is formed from the index-model estimates of security and market index parameters using these steps:\n    1. Compute the initial position of each security in the active portfolio as \n   w\ni05ai/s2(ei).   \n   2. Scale those initial positions to force portfolio weights to sum to 1 by dividing by \ntheir sum, that is,    wi5wi0\nan\ni51wi0.   \n   3. Compute the alpha of the active portfolio:    aA5an\ni51wiai.   \n   4. Compute the residual variance of the active portfolio:    s2(eA)5an\ni51wi2s2(ei).   \n 5. Compute the initial position in the active portfolio: we\nERAA\nA\nM\nM02()\n().\n2\n   6. Compute the beta of the active portfolio:    bA5an\ni51wibi.   \n   7. Adjust the initial position in the active portfolio:    wA*5wA0\n11(12bA)wA0.   \n   8. Note: the optimal risky portfolio now has weights:    wM*512wA*; wi*5wA*wi.   \n   9. Calculate the risk premium of the optimal risky portfolio from the risk \npremium of the index portfolio and the alpha of the active portfolio: \n   E(RP)5(wM*1wA*bA)E(RM)1wA*aA.  Notice that the beta of the risky portfolio \nis    w M*1wA*bA  because the beta of the index portfolio is 1.  \n   10. Compute the variance of the optimal risky portfolio from the  variance \nof the index portfolio and the residual variance of the active portfolio: \n   sP25(wM*1wA*bA)2sM213wA*s(eA)42.       \n  An Example \n We can illustrate the implementation of the index model by constructing an optimal port-\nfolio from the S&P 500 index and the six stocks for which we analyzed risk parameters in Section 8.3. \n This example entails only six analyzed stocks, but by virtue of selecting three  pairs  of \nfirms from the same industry with relatively high residual correlations, we put the index model to a severe test. This is because the model ignores the correlation between residuals when producing estimates for the covariance matrix. Therefore, comparison of results from the index model with the full-blown covariance (Markowitz) model should be instructive. \n  Risk Premium Forecasts   Panel 4 of  Spreadsheet 8.1  contains estimates of alpha and \nthe risk premium for each stock. These alphas would be the most important production of \nthe investment company in a real-life procedure. Statistics plays a small role here; in this arena, macro/security analysis is king. In this example, we simply use illustrative values to demonstrate the portfolio construction process and possible results. You may wonder why we \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   276bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   276 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 8 Index Models 277\nhave chosen such small, forecast alpha values. The reason is that even when security analysis \nuncovers a large apparent mispricing, that is, large alpha values, these forecasts must be \n substantially trimmed to account for the fact that such forecasts are subject to large estima-\ntion error. We discuss the important procedure of adjusting actual forecasts in Chapter 27.  \n  The Optimal Risky Portfolio   Panel 5 of  Spreadsheet 8.1  displays calculations for \nthe optimal risky portfolio. They follow the summary procedure of Section 8.4 (you should \ntry to replicate these calculations in your own spreadsheet). In this example we allow short \nsales. Notice that the weight of each security in the active portfolio (see row 52) has the \nsame sign as the alpha value. Allowing short sales, the positions in the active portfolio are \nquite large (e.g., the position in BP is .7349); this is an aggressive portfolio. As a result, \nthe alpha of the active portfolio (2.22%) is larger than that of any of the individual alpha \nforecasts. However, this aggressive stance also results in a large residual variance (.0404, \nwhich corresponds to a residual standard deviation of 20%). Therefore, the position in the \nactive portfolio is scaled down (see Equation 8.20) and ends up quite modest (.1718; cell \nC57), reinforcing the notion that diversification considerations are paramount in the opti-\nmal risky portfolio. \n The optimal risky portfolio has a risk premium of 6.48%, standard deviation of 14.22%, \nand a Sharpe ratio of .46 (cells J58\u2013J61). By comparison, the Sharpe ratio of the index \nportfolio is .06/.1358\u00a0 5 \u00a0.44 (cell B61), which is quite close to that of the optimal risky \nportfolio. The small improvement is a result of the modest alpha forecasts that we used. \nIn Chapter 11 on market efficiency and Chapter 24 on performance evaluation we demon-\nstrate that such results are common in the mutual fund industry. Of course, a few portfolio \nmanagers can and do produce portfolios with better performance. \n The interesting question here is the extent to which the index model produces results \nthat are inferior to that of the full-covariance (Markowitz) model.  Figure\u00a08.5  shows the \nefficient frontiers from the two models with the example data. We find that the difference is \nin fact small.  Table 8.2  compares the compositions and expected performance of the global \nminimum variance ( G ) and the optimal risky portfolios derived from the two models.   \n The standard deviations of efficient portfolios produced from the Markowitz model and \nthe index model are calculated from the covariance matrixes used in each model. As dis-\ncussed earlier, we cannot be sure that the covariance estimates  from the full covariance \nmodel are more accurate than those from \nthe more restrictive single-index model. \nHowever, by assuming the full covariance \nmodel to be more accurate, we get an idea \nof how far off the two models can be. \n  Figure\u00a0 8.5  shows that for conservative \nportfolios (closer to the minimum-variance \nportfolio  G),  the index model underesti-\nmates the volatility and hence overestimates \nperformance. The reverse happens with \nportfolios that are riskier than the index, \nwhich also include the region near the opti-\nmal portfolio. Despite these differences, \nwhat stands out from this comparison is \nthat the outputs of the two models are in \nfact extremely similar, with the index model \nperhaps calling for a more conservative \nposition. This is where we would like to be \nwith a model relying on approximations.     \n Figure 8.5 Efficient frontiers with the index model and \nfull-covariance matrix  .08\n.07\n.06\n.05\n.04\n.03\n.10 .11 .12 .13 .14 .15 .16 .17\nStandard DeviationRisk Premium Ef\ufb01cient Frontier (Full Covariance)\nEf\ufb01cient Frontier (Index Model)\nS&P500\nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   277bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   277 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2 7 8 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n   8.5 Practical Aspects of Portfolio Management with \nthe Index Model \n Table 8.2 \n Comparison of \nportfolios from \nthe single-index \nand full-\ncovariance \nmodels     Global Minimum \nVariance Portfolio    Optimal Portfolio  \n  Full-Covariance \nModel    Index \nModel    Full-Covariance \nModel    Index \nModel  \n Mean  .0371  .0354  .0677  .0649 \n SD  .1089  .1052  .1471  .1423 \n Sharpe ratio  .3409  .3370  .4605  .4558 \n  Portfolio Weights           \n S&P 500  .88  .83  .75  .83 \n HP   2 .11   2 .17  .10  .07 \n DELL   2 .01   2 .05   2 .04   2 .06 \n WMT  .23  .14   2 .03   2 .05 \n TARGET   2 .18   2 .08  .10  .06 \n BP  .22  .20  .25  .13 \n SHELL   2 .02  .12   2 .12  .03 \n  The tone of our discussions in this chapter indicates that the index model may be \npreferred for the practice of portfolio management. Switching from the Markowitz to an \nindex model is an important decision and hence the first question is whether the index \nmodel really is inferior to the Markowitz full-covariance model.  \n   Is the Index Model Inferior to the Full-Covariance Model? \n This question is partly related to a more general question of the value of parsimonious \nmodels. As an analogy, consider the question of adding additional explanatory variables \nin a regression equation. We know that adding explanatory variables will in most cases \nincrease  R -square, and in no case will  R -square fall. But this does not necessarily imply a \nbetter regression equation.  14   A better criterion is contribution to the predictive power of the \nregression. The appropriate question is whether inclusion of a variable that contributes to in-\nsample explanatory power is likely to contribute to out-of-sample forecast precision. Add-\ning variables, even ones that may appear significant, sometimes can be hazardous to forecast \nprecision. Put differently, a parsimonious model that is stingy about inclusion of indepen-\ndent variables is often superior. Predicting the value of the dependent variable depends on \ntwo factors, the precision of the coefficient estimates and the precision of the forecasts of \nthe independent variables. When we add variables, we introduce errors on both counts.  \n This problem applies as well to replacing the single-index with the full-blown \nMarkowitz model, or even a multi-index model of security returns. To add another index, \nwe need both a forecast of the risk premium of the additional index portfolio and estimates \nof security betas with respect to that additional factor. The Markowitz model allows far \n14 In fact, the adjusted  R -square may fall if the additional variable does not contribute enough explanatory power \nto compensate for the extra degree of freedom it uses. \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   278bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   278 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 8 Index Models 279\nmore flexibility in our modeling of asset covariance structure compared to the single-index \nmodel. But that advantage may be illusory if we can\u2019t estimate those covariances with a sufficient degree of accuracy. Using the full-covariance matrix invokes estimation risk of thousands of terms. Even if the full Markowitz model would be better  in principle,  it is \nvery possible that the cumulative effect of so many estimation errors will result in a portfolio that is actually inferior to that derived from the single-index model. \n Against the potential superiority of the full-covariance model, we have the clear practi-\ncal advantage of the single-index framework. Its aid in decentralizing macro and security analysis is another decisive advantage.  \n  The Industry Version of the Index Model \n Not surprisingly, the index model has attracted the attention of practitioners. To the extent that it is approximately valid, it provides a convenient benchmark for security analysis. \n A portfolio manager who has neither special information about a security nor insight \nthat is unavailable to the general public will take the security\u2019s alpha value as zero, and, according to Equation 8.9, will forecast a risk premium for the security equal to  b  \n i   R   M  . If \nwe restate this forecast in terms of total returns, one would expect\n    E(ri)5rf1bi3E(rM)2rf4  (8.25)   \n A portfolio manager who has a forecast for the market index,  E ( r   M  ), and observes the \nrisk-free T-bill rate,  r   f  , can use the model to determine the benchmark expected return for \nany stock. The beta coefficient, the market risk,    sM2,  and the firm-specific risk,  s  2 ( e ), can \nbe estimated from historical SCLs, that is, from regressions of security excess returns on \nmarket index excess returns. \n There are several proprietary sources for such regression results, sometimes called \u201cbeta \nbooks.\u201d The Web sites for this chapter at the Online Learning Center (  www.mhhe.com/bkm  )  \nalso provide security betas.  Table\u00a08.3  is a sample of a typical page from a beta book. Beta books typically use the S&P 500 as the proxy for the market portfolio. They commonly employ the 60 most recent monthly observations to calculate regression parameters, and use total returns, rather than excess returns (deviations from T-bill rates) in the regressions. In this way they estimate a variant of our index model, which is\n    r5a1br\nM1e*  (8.26)  \ninstead of\n    r2rf5a1b(rM2rf)1e  (8.27)  \nTo see the effect of this departure, we can rewrite Equation 8.27 as    r5r\nf1a1brM2brf1e5a1rf(12b)1brM1e  (8.28)  \nComparing Equations 8.26 and 8.28, you can see that if  r   f   is constant over the sample \nperiod, both equations have the same independent variable,  r   M  , and residual,  e.  Therefore, \nthe slope coefficient will be the same in the two regressions.  15     \n However, the intercept that beta books call ALPHA, as in  Table\u00a08.3 , is really an estimate \nof  a \u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 b ). The apparent justification for this procedure is that, on a monthly basis, \n r   f  \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 b ) is small and is likely to be swamped by the volatility of actual stock returns. But \nit is worth noting that for  b \u00a0\u2260\u00a01, the regression intercept in Equation 8.26 will not equal the \nindex model  a  as it does when excess returns are used as in Equation 8.27.  \n  15 Actually,  r   f   does vary over time and so should not be grouped casually with the constant term in the regression. \nHowever, variations in  r   f   are tiny compared with the swings in the market return. The actual volatility in the T-bill \nrate has only a small impact on the estimated value of  b . \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   279bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   279 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2 8 0 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\n Always remember as well that these alpha estimates are ex post (after the fact) mea-\nsures. They do not mean that anyone could have forecast these alpha values ex ante (before \nthe fact). In fact, the name of the game in security analysis is to forecast alpha values \nahead of time. A well-constructed portfolio that includes long positions in future positive-\nalpha stocks and short positions in future negative-alpha stocks will outperform the market \nindex. The key term here is \u201cwell constructed,\u201d meaning that the portfolio has to balance \nconcentration on high-alpha stocks with the need for risk-reducing diversification as dis-\ncussed earlier in the chapter. \n Much of the other output in  Table\u00a08.3  is similar to the Excel output ( Table 8.1 ) that we \ndiscussed when estimating the index model for Hewlett-Packard. The  R -square statistic \nis the ratio of systematic variance to total variance, the fraction of total volatility attribut-\nable to market movements. For most firms,  R -square is substantially below .5, indicating \nthat stocks have far more firm-specific than systematic risk. This highlights the practical \nimportance of diversification. \n  Ticker \nSymbol    Security Name    BETA    ALPHA    RSQ    Residual \nStd Dev    Std Error \nBeta    Standard \nError Alpha    Adjusted \nBeta  \n AMZN   Amazon.com   2.25  0.006  0.238  0.1208  0.5254  0.0156  1.84 \n F  Ford  1.64   2 0.012  0.183  0.1041  0.4525  0.0135  1.43 \n NEM  Newmont Mining Corp.  0.44  0.002  0.023  0.0853  0.3709  0.0110  0.62 \n INTC  Intel Corporation  1.60   2 0.010  0.369  0.0627  0.2728  0.0081  1.40 \n MSFT  Microsoft Corporation  0.87  0.001  0.172  0.0569  0.2477  0.0074  0.91 \n DELL  Dell Inc.  1.36   2 0.014  0.241  0.0723  0.3143  0.0094  1.24 \n BA  Boeing Co.  1.42  0.004  0.402  0.0517  0.2250  0.0067  1.28 \n MCD  McDonald\u2019s Corp.  0.92  0.016  0.312  0.0409  0.1777  0.0053  0.95 \n PFE  Pfizer Inc.  0.65   2 0.006  0.131  0.0504  0.2191  0.0065  0.77 \n DD  DuPont  0.97   2 0.002  0.311  0.0434  0.1887  0.0056  0.98 \n DIS  Walt Disney Co.  0.91  0.005  0.278  0.0440  0.1913  0.0057  0.94 \n XOM  ExxonMobil Corp.  0.87  0.011  0.216  0.0497  0.2159  0.0064  0.91 \n IBM  IBM Corp.  0.88  0.004  0.248  0.0459  0.1997  0.0059  0.92 \n WMT  Walmart  0.06  0.002  0.002  0.0446  0.1941  0.0058  0.38 \n HNZ  HJ Heinz Co.  0.43  0.009  0.110  0.0368  0.1599  0.0048  0.62 \n LTD  Limited Brands Inc.  1.30  0.001  0.216  0.0741  0.3223  0.0096  1.20 \n ED  Consolidated Edison Inc.  0.15  0.004  0.101  0.0347  0.1509  0.0045  0.43 \n GE  General Electric Co.  0.65   2 0.002  0.173  0.0425  0.1850  0.0055  0.77 \n   MEAN  0.97  0.001  0.207  0.0589  0.2563  0.0076  0.98 \n   STD DEVIATION  0.56  0.008  0.109  0.0239  0.1039  0.0031  0.37 \n Table 8.3 \n Market sensitivity statistics: Regressions of total stock returns on total S&P 500 returns over 60 months, 2004\u20132008 \n Source: Compiled from CRSP (University of Chicago) database. \n What was Intel\u2019s index-model  a  per month during the period covered by the  Table\u00a08.3  regression if during \nthis period the average monthly rate of return on T-bills was .2%?

The standard errors of the alpha \nand beta estimates allow us to evaluate the precision of the estimates. Notice that the stan-dard errors of alpha tend to be far greater multiples of the estimated value of alpha than is the case for beta estimates. \n Intel\u2019s  Resid Std Dev  is 6.27% per month and its  R  \n2  is .369. This tells us that \n   sIntel2(e)56.272539.31  and, because  R  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a01\u00a0 2 \u00a0 s  2 ( e )/ s  2 , we can solve for Intel\u2019s total \nstandard deviation by rearranging as follows:\n    sIntel5BsIntel2(e)\n12R2R1/2\n5a39.31\n.631b1/2\n57.89% per month   \n This is Intel\u2019s monthly standard deviation for the sample period. Therefore, the annualized \nstandard deviation for that period was 7.89    \"12527.33%  .\n The last column is called Adjusted Beta. The motivation for adjusting beta estimates \nis that, on average, the beta coefficients of stocks seem to move toward 1 over time. One explanation for this phenomenon is intuitive. A business enterprise usually is established to produce a specific product or service, and a new firm may be more unconventional than an older one in many ways, from technology to management style. As it grows, however, a firm often diversifies, first expanding to similar products and later to more diverse opera-tions. As the firm becomes more conventional, it starts to resemble the rest of the economy even more. Thus its beta coefficient will tend to change in the direction of 1. \n Another explanation for this phenomenon is statistical. We know that the average beta \nover all securities is 1. Thus, before estimating the beta of a security, our best forecast would be that it is 1. When we estimate this beta coefficient over a particular sample period, we sustain some unknown sampling error of the estimated beta. The greater the dif-ference between our beta estimate and 1, the greater is the chance that we incurred a large estimation error and that beta in a subsequent sample period will be closer to 1. \n The sample estimate of the beta coefficient is the best guess for that sample period. \nGiven that beta has a tendency to evolve toward 1, however, a forecast of the future beta coefficient should adjust the sample estimate in that direction. \n  Table\u00a08.3  adjusts beta estimates in a simple way.  \n16   It takes the sample estimate of beta \nand averages it with 1, using weights of two-thirds and one-third:  \n    A djusted beta 52\u20443 sample beta 11\u20443 (1)  (8.29)     \n  16 A more sophisticated method is described in Oldrich A. Vasicek, \u201cA Note on Using Cross-Sectional Information \nin Bayesian Estimation of Security Betas,\u201d  Journal of Finance  28 (1973), pp. 1233\u201339.  For the 60 months used in  Table\u00a08.3 , Intel\u2019s beta was estimated at 1.60. Therefore, its \nadjusted beta is  2\u20443\u00a03\u00a01.60\u00a01\u00a01\u20443 5 1.40,  taking it a third of the way toward 1. \n In the absence of special information concerning Intel, if our forecast for the market \nindex is 10% and T-bills pay 4%, we learn from the beta book that the forecast for the \nrate of return on Intel stock is\n    E(rIntel)5rf1Adjusted beta 33E(rM)2rf4\n 5411.40 (1024)512.40%   \n The sample period regression alpha is  2 1.0%. Because Intel\u2019s beta is greater than 1, \nwe know that this means that the estimate of the index model  a  is somewhat larger.  Example 8.1 Adjusted Beta \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   281bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   281 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\n282 PART II  Portfolio Theory and Practice\nAs in Equation 8.28, we have to subtract (1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 b ) r   f   from the regression alpha to obtain \nthe index model  a . In any event, the standard error of the alpha estimate is .81%. The \nestimate of alpha is far less than twice its standard error. Consequently, we cannot reject \nthe hypothesis that the true alpha is zero. \n  Predicting Betas \n Adjusted betas are a simple way to recognize that betas estimated from past data may not \nbe the best estimates of future betas: Betas seem to drift toward 1 over time. This suggests that we might want a forecasting model for beta. \n One simple approach would be to collect data on beta in different periods and then esti-\nmate a regression equation:\n    Current beta 5a1b (Past beta )  (8.30)  \nGiven estimates of  a  and  b,  we would then forecast future betas using the rule\n    Forecast beta 5a1b (Current beta )  (8.31)  \nThere is no reason, however, to limit ourselves to such simple forecasting rules. Why not \nalso investigate the predictive power of other financial variables in forecasting beta? For example, if we believe that firm size and debt ratios are two determinants of beta, we might specify an expanded version of Equation 8.30 and estimate\n   Current beta 5a1b\n1(Past beta )1b2(Firm size )1b3(Debt ratio ) \nNow we would use estimates of  a  and  b  1  through  b  3  to forecast future betas. \n Such an approach was followed by Rosenberg and Guy,  17   who found the following \nvariables to help predict betas:  \n    1. Variance of earnings.  \n   2. Variance of cash flow.     3. Growth in earnings per share.     4. Market capitalization (firm size).     5. Dividend yield.     6. Debt-to-asset ratio.    \n Rosenberg and Guy also found that even after controlling for a firm\u2019s financial charac-\nteristics, industry group helps to predict beta. For example, they found that the beta values \nof gold mining companies are on average .827 lower than would be predicted based on financial characteristics alone. This should not be surprising; the  2 .827 \u201cadjustment factor\u201d \nfor the gold industry reflects the fact that gold values are inversely related to market returns. \n  Table\u00a08.4  presents beta estimates and adjustment factors for a subset of firms in the \nRosenberg and Guy study.  \n   \n  17 Barr Rosenberg and J.

Her \nsecurity analysis team estimates the index model equation for this portfolio (using the S&P \n500 index) in excess return form and obtains the following estimates:\nRP5.0411.4RS&P5001eP  (8.32)   Alpha Betting \n For those who believe in efficient markets, the recent \nexplosion in the number of exchange-traded funds rep-\nresents a triumph. ETFs are quoted securities that track a \nparticular index, for a fee that is normally just a fraction \nof a percentage point. They enable investors to assemble \na low-cost portfolio covering a wide range of assets from \ninternational equities, through government and corporate \nbonds, to commodities. \n But as fast as the assets of ETFs and index-tracking \nmutual funds are growing, another section of the indus-\ntry seems to be flourishing even faster. Watson Wyatt, a \nfirm of actuaries, estimates that \u201calternative asset invest-\nment\u201d (ranging from hedge funds through private equity \nto property) grew by around 20% in 2005, to $1.26 trillion. \nInvestors who take this route pay much higher fees in the \nhope of better performance. One of the fastest-growing \nassets, funds of hedge funds, charge some of the highest \nfees of all. \n Why are people paying up? In part, because investors \nhave learned to distinguish between the market return, \ndubbed beta, and managers\u2019 outperformance, known \nas alpha. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you buy beta and alpha sepa-\nrately?\u201d asks Arno Kitts of Henderson Global Investors, a \nfund-management firm. \u201cBeta is a commodity and alpha \nis about skill.\u201d \n Clients have become convinced that no one firm can \nproduce good performance in every asset class. That has led to a \u201ccore and satellite\u201d model, in which part of the \nportfolio is invested in index trackers with the rest in the \nhands of specialists. But this creates its own problems. Rela-\ntions with a single balanced manager are simple. It is much \nharder to research and monitor the performance of spe-\ncialists. That has encouraged the middlemen\u2014managers \nof managers (in the traditional institutional business) and \nfunds-of-funds (in the hedge-fund world), which are usu-\nally even more expensive. \n That their fees endure might suggest investors can \nidentify outperforming fund managers in advance. How-\never, studies suggest this is extremely hard. And even \nwhere you can spot talent, much of the extra perfor-\nmance may be siphoned off into higher fees. \u201cA dispro-\nportionate amount of the benefits of alpha go to the \nmanager, not the client,\u201d says Alan Brown at Schroders, \nan asset manager. \n In any event, investors will probably keep pursuing \nalpha, even though the cheaper alternatives of ETFs and \ntracking funds are available. Craig Baker of Watson Wyatt, \nsays that, although above-market returns may not be avail-\nable to all, clients who can identify them have a \u201cfirst \nmover\u201d advantage. As long as that belief exists, managers \ncan charge high fees. \nSource:    The Economist,   September 14, 2006. Copyright \u00a9 The \nEconomist Newspaper Limited, London.

The manager is confident in the \nquality of her security analysis but is wary about the performance of the broad market in \nthe near term. If she buys the portfolio, and the market as a whole turns down, she still could lose money on her investment (which has a large positive beta) even if her team is correct that the portfolio is underpriced on a relative basis. She would like a position that takes advantage of her team\u2019s analysis but is independent of the performance of the overall market. \n To this end, a    tracking portfolio    ( T ) can be constructed. A tracking portfolio for port-\nfolio  P  is a portfolio designed to match the systematic component of  P \u2019s return. The idea \nis for the portfolio to \u201ctrack\u201d the market-sensitive component of  P \u2019s return. This means the \ntracking portfolio must have the same beta on the index portfolio as  P  and as little nonsys-\ntematic risk as possible. This procedure is also called  beta capture.  \n A tracking portfolio for  P  will have a levered position in the S&P 500 to achieve a beta \nof 1.4. Therefore,  T  includes positions of 1.4 in the S&P 500 and  2 .4 in T-bills. Because  T  \nis constructed from the index and bills, it has an alpha value of zero. \n Now consider buying portfolio  P  but at the same time offsetting systematic risk by \nassuming a short position in the tracking portfolio. The short position in  T  cancels out the \nsystematic exposure of the long position in  P:  the overall combined position is thus  market \nneutral.  Therefore, even if the market does poorly, the combined position should not be affected. But the alpha on portfolio  P  will remain intact. The combined portfolio,  C,  pro-\nvides an excess return per dollar of\n    R\nC5RP2RT5(.0411.4R S&P5001eP)21.4R S&P5005.041eP  (8.33)  \nWhile this portfolio is still risky (due to the residual risk,  e   P  ), the systematic risk has been \neliminated, and if  P  is reasonably well-diversified, the remaining nonsystematic risk will \nbe small. Thus the objective is achieved: The manager can take advantage of the 4% alpha \nwithout inadvertently taking on market exposure. The process of separating the search for alpha from the choice of market exposure is called  alpha transport.  \n This \u201clong-short strategy\u201d is characteristic of the activity of many  hedge funds.  Hedge \nfund managers identify an underpriced security and then try to attain a \u201cpure play\u201d on the perceived underpricing. They hedge out all extraneous risk, focusing the bet only on the perceived \u201calpha\u201d (see the box on p. 283). Tracking funds are the vehicle used to hedge the exposures to which they do  not  want exposure. Hedge fund managers use index regres-\nsions such as those discussed here, as well as more-sophisticated variations, to create the tracking portfolios at the heart of their hedging strategies.     \n   SUMMARY      1 .   A single-factor model of the economy classifies sources of uncertainty as systematic (macro-\neconomic) factors or firm-specific (microeconomic) factors. The index model assumes that the macro factor can be represented by a broad index of stock returns.  \n    2 .   The single-index model drastically reduces the necessary inputs in the Markowitz portfolio selec-tion procedure. It also aids in specialization of labor in security analysis.  \n    3 .   According to the index model specification, the systematic risk of a portfolio or asset equals    b\n2sM2  \nand the covariance between two assets equals    bibjsM2.   \n    4 .   The index model is estimated by applying regression analysis to excess rates of return. The slope of the regression curve is the beta of an asset, whereas the intercept is the asset\u2019s alpha during the sample period. The regression line is also called the  security characteristic line.   \nbod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   284bod61671_ch08_256-290.indd   284 6/21/13   4:10 PM6/21/13   4:10 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 8 Index Models 285\n    5 .   Optimal active portfolios constructed from the index model include analyzed securities in propor-\ntion to their information ratios. The full risky portfolio is a mixture of the active portfolio and the passive market-index portfolio. The index portfolio is used to enhance the diversification of the overall risky position.  \n    6 .   Practitioners routinely estimate the index model using total rather than excess rates of return. This makes their estimate of alpha equal to  a \u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  \n f  \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 b ).  \n    7 .   Betas show a tendency to evolve toward 1 over time. Beta forecasting rules attempt to predict this \ndrift. Moreover, other financial variables can be used to help forecast betas.

The model gives us a precise prediction of the rela-tionship that we should observe between the risk of an asset and its expected return. This relationship serves two vital functions. First, it provides a benchmark rate of return for evaluating possible investments. For exam-ple, if we are analyzing securities, we might be interested in whether the expected return we forecast for a stock is more or less than its \u201cfair\u201d return given its risk. Second, the model helps us to make an educated guess as to the expected return on assets that have not yet been traded in the marketplace. For example, how do we price an initial public offering of stock? How will a major new investment proj-ect affect the return investors require on a company\u2019s stock? Although the CAPM does not fully withstand empirical tests, it is widely used because of the insight it offers and because its accuracy is deemed acceptable for important applications.   The Capital Asset \nPricing Model    CHAPTER NINE \n    9.1 The Capital Asset Pricing Model  \n The capital asset pricing model is a set of predictions concerning equilibrium expected \nreturns on risky assets. Harry Markowitz laid down the foundation of modern portfolio management in 1952. The CAPM was published 12 years later in articles by William Sharpe,  \n1   John Lintner,  2   and Jan Mossin.  3   The time for this gestation indicates that the \nleap from Markowitz\u2019s portfolio selection model to the CAPM is not trivial.  \n Shooting straight to the heart of the CAPM, suppose all investors optimized their port-\nfolios \u00e1 la Markowitz. That is, each investor uses an input list (expected returns and covari-ance matrix) to draw an efficient frontier employing all available risky assets and identifies an efficient risky portfolio,  P,  by drawing the tangent CAL (capital allocation line) to the \nfrontier as in  Figure\u00a09.1 , panel A (which is just a reproduction of Figure 7.11). As a result, each investor holds securities in the investable universe with weights arrived at by the Markowitz optimization process.  \n1 William Sharpe, \u201cCapital Asset Prices: A Theory of Market Equilibrium,\u201d  Journal of Finance,  September 1964. \n2 John Lintner, \u201cThe Valuation of Risk Assets and the Selection of Risky Investments in Stock Portfolios and \nCapital Budgets,\u201d  Review of Economics and Statistics,  February 1965. \n3 Jan Mossin, \u201cEquilibrium in a Capital Asset Market,\u201d  Econometrica,  October 1966. 9 \n PART III \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   291bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   291 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2 9 2 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n The CAPM asks what would \nhappen if all investors shared an \nidentical investable universe and \nused the same input list to draw \ntheir efficient frontiers. Obviously, \ntheir efficient frontiers would be \nidentical. Facing the same risk-free \nrate, they would then draw an iden-\ntical tangent CAL and naturally \nall would arrive at the same risky \nportfolio,  P.  All investors there-\nfore would choose the same set of \nweights for each risky asset. What \nmust be these weights? \n A key insight of the CAPM is \nthis: Because the market portfolio \nis the aggregation of all of these \nidentical risky portfolios, it too will \nhave the same weights. Therefore, \nif all investors choose the same \nrisky portfolio, it must be the  mar-\nket  portfolio, that is, the value-\nweighted portfolio of all assets in \nthe investable universe. Therefore, \nthe capital allocation line based \non each investor\u2019s optimal risky \nportfolio will in fact also be the \ncapital  market   line, as depicted in \n Figure\u00a0 9.1 , panel B. This impli-\ncation will allow us to say much \nabout the risk\u2013return trade-off.  \n   Why Do All Investors Hold \nthe Market Portfolio? \n What is the market portfolio? \nWhen we sum over, or aggregate, \nthe portfolios of all individual \ninvestors, lending and borrowing \nwill cancel out (because each lender has a corresponding borrower), and the value of the \naggregate risky portfolio will equal the entire wealth of the economy. This is the    market \nportfolio,   M.    The proportion of each stock in this portfolio equals the market value of the \nstock (price per share times number of shares outstanding) divided by the sum of the mar-\nket value of all stocks.  4   This implies that if the weight of GE stock, for example, in each \ncommon risky portfolio is 1%, then GE also will constitute 1% of the market portfolio. The \nsame principle applies to the proportion of any stock in each investor\u2019s risky portfolio. As \na result, the optimal risky portfolio of all investors is simply a share of the market portfolio \nin  Figure\u00a09.1 .  \nE(r)\nCAL( P)\nEf\ufb01cient FrontierA: The Ef\ufb01cient Frontier of Risky Assets with the Optimal CAL\nB: The Ef\ufb01cient Frontier and the Capital Market LineP\nrf\n\u03c3E(rP)\n\u03c3P\nE(r)\nCML\nEf\ufb01cient Frontier\nM\nrf\n\u03c3E(rM)\n\u03c3M\n Figure 9.1 Capital allocation line and the capital market line     \n4 We use the term \u201cstock\u201d for convenience; the market portfolio properly includes all assets in the economy. \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   292bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   292 7/25/13   6:17 AM7/25/13   6:17 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 9 The Capital Asset Pricing Model  293\n Now suppose that the optimal portfolio of our investors does not include the stock of \nsome company, such as Delta Airlines. When all investors avoid Delta stock, the demand \nis zero, and Delta\u2019s price takes a free fall. As Delta stock gets progressively cheaper, it becomes ever more attractive and other stocks look relatively less attractive. Ultimately, Delta reaches a price where it is attractive enough to include in the optimal stock portfolio. \n Such a price adjustment process guarantees that all stocks will be included in the opti-\nmal portfolio. It shows that  all  assets have to be included in the market portfolio. The only \nissue is the price at which investors will be willing to include a stock in their optimal risky portfolio.  \n  The Passive Strategy Is Efficient \n In Chapter 6 we defined the CML as the CAL that is constructed from a money market account (or T-bills) and the market portfolio. Perhaps now you can fully appreciate why the CML is an interesting CAL. In the simple world of the CAPM,  M  is the optimal tan-\ngency portfolio on the efficient frontier. \n In this scenario, the market portfolio held by all investors is based on the common input \nlist, thereby incorporating all relevant information about the universe of securities. This means that investors can skip the trouble of doing security analysis and obtain an efficient portfolio simply by holding the market portfolio. (Of course, if everyone were to follow this strategy, no one would perform security analysis and this result would no longer hold. We discuss this issue in greater depth in Chapter 11 on market efficiency.) \n Thus the passive strategy of investing in a market-index portfolio is efficient. For this \nreason, we sometimes call this result a    mutual fund theorem   . The mutual fund theorem \nis another incarnation of the separation property discussed in Chapter 7. If all investors would freely choose to hold a common risky portfolio identical to the market  portfolio, they would not object if all stocks in the market were replaced with shares of a single mutual fund holding that market portfolio. \n In reality, different investment managers do create risky portfolios that differ from the \nmarket index. We attribute this in part to the use of different input lists in the formation of their optimal risky portfolios. Nevertheless, the practical significance of the mutual fund theorem is that a passive investor may view the market index as a reasonable first approximation to an efficient risky portfolio.  \n The nearby box contains a parable illustrating the argu-\nment for indexing. If the passive strategy is efficient, then attempts to beat it simply generate trading and research costs with no offsetting benefit, and ultimately inferior results.   \n  The Risk Premium of the Market Portfolio \n In Chapter 6 we discussed how individual investors go about deciding capital allocation. If all investors choose to invest in portfolio  M  and the risk-free asset, what can we deduce \nabout the equilibrium risk premium of portfolio  M  ?\n Recall that each individual investor chooses a proportion  y,  allocated to the optimal \nportfolio  M,  such that\n    y5E\n ( rM  )2rf\nAsM2  (9.1)  \nwhere  E ( r   M  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E ( R   M  ) is the risk premium (expected excess return) on the market \nportfolio.  If there are only a few investors who perform \nsecurity analysis, and all others hold the market portfolio,  M,  would the CML still be the efficient \nCAL for investors who do not engage in security analysis? Why or why not?

Any borrowing position must be offset by the lending position of \nthe creditor. This means that net borrowing and lending across all investors must be zero, and therefore, substituting the representative investor\u2019s risk aversion, A\n, for  A,  the average \nposition in the risky portfolio is 100%, or    y51.  Setting  y \u00a0 5 \u00a01 in Equation\u00a09.1 and rear-\nranging, we find that the risk premium on the market portfolio is related to its variance by the average degree of risk aversion:\n    E\n ( RM  )5AsM2  (9.2)      The Parable of the Money Managers \n Some years ago, in a land called Indicia, revolution led to \nthe overthrow of a socialist regime and the restoration of a system of private property. Former government enterprises were reformed as corporations, which then issued stocks and bonds. These securities were given to a central agency, which offered them for sale to individuals, pension funds, and the like (all armed with newly printed money). \n Almost immediately a group of money managers came \nforth to assist these investors. Recalling the words of a \nvenerated elder, uttered before the previous revolution (\u201cInvest in Corporate Indicia\u201d), they invited clients to give them money, with which they would buy a cross-section of all the newly issued securities. Investors considered this a reasonable idea, and soon everyone held a piece of Corporate Indicia. \n Before long the money managers became bored \nbecause there was little for them to do. Soon they fell into \nthe habit of gathering at a beachfront casino where they passed the time playing roulette, craps, and similar games, for low stakes, with their own money. \n After a while, the owner of the casino suggested a new \nidea. He would furnish an impressive set of rooms which \nwould be designated the Money Managers\u2019 Club. There the members could place bets with one another about the fortunes of various corporations, industries, the level of the Gross Domestic Product, foreign trade, etc. To make the betting more exciting, the casino owner suggested that the managers use their clients\u2019 money for this purpose. \n The offer was immediately accepted, and soon the \nmoney managers were betting eagerly with one another. \nAt the end of each week, some found that they had won money for their clients, while others found that they had lost. But the losses always exceeded the gains, for a  certain amount was deducted from each bet to cover the costs of the elegant surroundings in which the gambling took place. \n Before long a group of professors from Indicia U. sug-\ngested that investors were not well served by the activi-\nties being conducted at the Money Managers\u2019 Club. \u201cWhy pay people to gamble with your money? Why not just hold your own piece of Corporate Indicia?\u201d they said. \n This argument seemed sensible to some of the inves-\ntors, and they raised the issue with their money managers. \nA few capitulated, announcing that they would henceforth stay away from the casino and use their clients\u2019 money only to buy proportionate shares of all the stocks and bonds issued by corporations. \n The converts, who became known as managers of \n Indicia funds, were initially shunned by those who contin-\nued to frequent the Money Managers\u2019 Club, but in time, grudging acceptance replaced outright hostility. The wave of puritan reform some had predicted failed to material-ize, and gambling remained legal. Many managers contin-ued to make their daily pilgrimage to the casino. But they exercised more restraint than before, placed smaller bets, and generally behaved in a manner consonant with their responsibilities. Even the members of the Lawyers\u2019 Club found it difficult to object to the small amount of gam-bling that still went on. \n And everyone but the casino owner lived happily ever \nafter. \n  Source:  William F.

Portfolio risk is \nwhat matters to investors and is what governs the risk premiums they demand. \n Remember that in the CAPM, all investors use the same input list, that is, the same \nestimates of expected returns, variances, and covariances. To calculate the variance of \nthe market portfolio, we use the bordered covariance matrix with the market portfolio \nweights, as discussed in Chapter 7. We highlight GE in this depiction of the  n  stocks in the \nmarket portfolio so that we can measure the contribution of GE to the risk of the market \nportfolio. \n Recall that we calculate the variance of the portfolio by summing over all the elements \nof the covariance matrix, first multiplying each element by the portfolio weights from the \nrow and the column. The contribution of one stock to portfolio variance therefore can be \nexpressed as the sum of all the covariance terms in the column corresponding to the stock, \nwhere each covariance is first multiplied by both the stock\u2019s weight from its row and the \nweight from its column.  5     \n  5 An alternative approach would be to measure GE\u2019s contribution to market variance as the sum of the elements in the \nrow  and  the column corresponding to GE. In this case, GE\u2019s contribution would be twice the sum in Equation\u00a09.3. \nThe approach that we take in the text allocates contributions to portfolio risk among securities in a convenient man-\nner in that the sum of the contributions of each stock equals the total portfolio variance, whereas the alternative mea-\nsure of contribution would sum to twice the portfolio variance. This results from a type of double-counting, because \nadding both the rows and the columns for each stock would result in each entry in the matrix being added twice.  Thus, the contribution of GE\u2019s stock to the variance of the market portfolio is\nwGE3w1Cov  ( R1, RGE )1w2Cov  ( R2, RGE )1. . .1wGECov  ( RGE, RGE )1. . .

For example, if the covariance between GE and the rest \nof the market is negative, then GE makes a \u201cnegative contribution\u201d to portfolio risk: By \nproviding excess returns that move inversely with the rest of the market, GE stabilizes the return on the overall portfolio. If the covariance is positive, GE makes a positive contribu-tion to overall portfolio risk because its returns reinforce swings in the rest of the portfolio.  \n6    \n We also observe that the contribution of GE to the risk premium of the market portfolio \nis  w   GE   E ( R   GE  ).

Notice that for  components  of the \nefficient portfolio, such as shares of GE, we measure risk as the  contribution  to portfolio \nvariance (which depends on its  covariance  with the market). In contrast, for the efficient \nportfolio itself, variance is the appropriate measure of risk.  7   \n A basic principle of equilibrium is that all investments should offer the same reward-\nto-risk ratio. If the ratio were better for one investment than another, investors would rear-\nrange their portfolios, tilting toward the alternative with the better trade-off and shying away from the other. Such activity would impart pressure on security prices until the ratios were equalized. Therefore we conclude that the reward-to-risk ratios of GE and the market portfolio should be equal:\n    E(R\nGE)\nCov(RGE, RM)5E(RM)\nsM2  (9.6)  \nTo determine the fair risk premium of GE stock, we rearrange Equation 9.6 slightly to obtain\n    E(RGE)5Cov(RGE, RM)\nsM2 E(RM)  (9.7)  \n  6 A positive contribution to variance doesn\u2019t imply that diversification isn\u2019t beneficial. Excluding GE from the \nportfolio would require that its weight be assigned to the remaining stocks, and that reallocation would increase \nvariance even more. Variance is reduced by including more stocks and reducing the weight of all (i.e., diversify-ing), despite the fact that each positive-covariance security makes some contribution to variance. \n  \n7 Unfortunately the market portfolio\u2019s Sharpe ratio\n   E(rM)2rf\nsM \nsometimes is referred to as the market price of risk, but it is not.

The ratio is \ncalled    beta    and is denoted by  b . Using this measure, we can restate Equation 9.7 as\n    E(rGE)5rf1bGE3E(rM)2rf4  (9.8)  \nThis    expected return\u2013beta ( or  mean-beta) relationship    is the most familiar expression \nof the CAPM to practitioners. \n If the expected return\u2013beta relationship holds for any individual asset, it must hold for \nany combination of assets. Suppose that some portfolio  P  has weight  w   k   for stock  k,  where \n k  takes on values 1, .\u00a0.\u00a0. ,  n.  Writing out the CAPM Equation 9.8 for each stock, and multi-\nplying each equation by the weight of the stock in the portfolio, we obtain these equations, \none for each stock:\n    w 1E(r1)5w1rf1w1b13E(rM)2rf4\n 1w2E(r2)5w2rf1w2b23E(rM)2rf4\n 1     \u00a0c5c\n 1wnE(rn)5wnrf1wnbn3E(rM)2rf4\n E(rP)5rf1bP3E(rM)2rf4  \nSumming each column shows that the CAPM holds for the overall portfolio because  \n   E(r P) 5 g\nkwkE(r k ) is the expected return on the portfolio, and b P 5 g\nkwk bk     is the portfolio \nbeta. Incidentally, this result has to be true for the market portfolio itself,\n   E(rM)5rf1bM3E(rM)2rf4 \nIndeed, this is a tautology because  b   M  \u00a0 5 \u00a01, as we can verify by noting that\n   bM5Cov(RM, RM)\nsM25sM2\nsM2 \nThis also establishes 1 as the weighted-average value of beta across all assets. If the market \nbeta is 1, and the market is a portfolio of all assets in the economy, the weighted-average beta of all assets must be 1. Hence betas greater than 1 are considered aggressive in that investment in high-beta stocks entails above-average sensitivity to market swings. Betas below 1 can be described as defensive. \n A word of caution: We often hear that well-managed firms will provide high rates of \nreturn. We agree this is true if one measures the  firm\u2019s  return on its investments in plant \nand equipment. The CAPM, however, predicts returns on investments in the  securities   \nof the firm. \n Let\u2019s say that everyone knows a firm is well run. Its stock price will therefore be bid \nup, and consequently returns to stockholders who buy at those high prices will not be excessive. Security prices, in other words, already reflect public information about a firm\u2019s prospects; therefore only the risk of the company (as measured by beta in the context of the CAPM) should affect expected returns. In a well-functioning market, investors receive high expected returns only if they are willing to bear risk. \n Investors do not directly observe or determine expected returns on securities. Rather, \nthey observe security prices and bid those prices up or down. Expected rates of return are determined by the prices investors must pay compared to the cash flows those investments might garner.   \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   297bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   297 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\n2 9 8 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n  The Security Market Line \n We can view the expected return\u2013beta relationship as a reward\u2013risk equation. The beta of \na security is the appropriate measure of its risk because beta is proportional to the risk the \nsecurity contributes to the optimal risky portfolio. \n Risk-averse investors measure the risk of the optimal risky portfolio by its variance. \nHence, we would expect the risk premium on individual assets to depend on the  contribu-\ntion  of the asset to the risk of the portfolio. The beta of a stock measures its contribution to \nthe variance of the market portfolio and therefore the required risk premium is a function \nof beta. The CAPM confirms this intuition, stating further that the security\u2019s risk premium \nis directly proportional to both the beta and the risk premium of the market portfolio; that \nis, the risk premium equals  b [ E ( rM )\u00a0 2rf ]. \n The expected return\u2013beta relationship can be portrayed graphically as the    security \nmarket line (SML)    in  Figure\u00a09.2 . Because the market\u2019s beta is 1, the slope is the risk pre-\nmium of the market portfolio. At the point on the horizontal axis where  b5 \u00a01, we can read \noff the vertical axis the expected return on the market portfolio.  \n It is useful to compare the security market line to the capital market line. The CML \ngraphs the risk premiums of  efficient   portfolios (i.e., portfolios composed of the market \nand the risk-free asset) as a function of portfolio standard deviation. This is appropriate \nbecause standard deviation is a valid measure of risk for efficiently diversified portfolios \nthat are candidates for an investor\u2019s overall portfolio. \nThe SML, in contrast, graphs  individual asset   risk \npremiums as a function of asset risk. The relevant \nmeasure of risk for individual assets held as parts of \nwell-diversified portfolios is not the asset\u2019s standard \ndeviation or variance; it is, instead, the contribution of \nthe asset to the portfolio variance, which we measure \nby the asset\u2019s beta. The SML is valid for both efficient \nportfolios and individual assets. \n The security market line provides a benchmark \nfor the evaluation of investment performance. Given \nthe risk of an investment, as measured by its beta, the \nSML provides the required rate of return necessary to \ncompensate investors for risk as well as the time value \nof money. \n Because the security market line is the graphic rep-\nresentation of the expected return\u2013beta relationship, \n\u201cfairly priced\u201d assets plot exactly on the SML; that \nis, their expected returns are commensurate with their \nrisk. All securities must lie on the SML in market \nequilibrium. We see here how the CAPM may be of \nuse in the money-management industry.

Then security \nanalysis is performed to calculate the return actually \nexpected. (Notice that we depart here from the simple \nCAPM world in that some investors now apply their \nown unique analysis to derive an \u201cinput list\u201d that may \ndiffer from their competitors\u2019.) If a stock is perceived \nto be a good buy, or underpriced, it will provide an \nexpected return in excess of the fair return stipulated \nby the SML. Underpriced stocks therefore plot above \nthe SML: Given their betas, their expected returns \nare greater than dictated by the CAPM. Overpriced \nstocks plot below the SML.  \n The difference between the fair and actually \nexpected rates of return on a stock is called the stock\u2019s \n   alpha   , denoted by  a . For example, if the market return \nis expected to be 14%, a stock has a beta of 1.2, and the \nT-bill rate is 6%, the SML would predict an expected \nreturn on the stock of 6\u00a0 1 \u00a01.2(14\u00a0 2 \u00a06)\u00a0 5 \u00a015.6%. If \none believed the stock would provide an expected \nreturn of 17%, the implied alpha would be 1.4% (see \n Figure\u00a09.3 ).  \n One might say that security analysis (which we \ntreat in Part Five) is about uncovering securities with \nnonzero alphas. This analysis suggests that the starting point of portfolio management can \nbe a passive market-index portfolio. The portfolio manager will then increase the weights \nof securities with positive alphas and decrease the weights of securities with negative \nalphas. We showed one strategy for adjusting the portfolio weights in such a manner in \nChapter 8. \n The CAPM is also useful in capital budgeting decisions. For a firm considering a new \nproject, the CAPM can provide the  required rate of return   that the project needs to yield, \nbased on its beta, to be acceptable to investors. Managers can use the CAPM to obtain this \ncutoff internal rate of return (IRR), or \u201churdle rate\u201d for the project. \n The nearby box describes how the CAPM can be used in capital budgeting. It also \ndiscusses some empirical anomalies concerning the model, which we address in detail in \nChapters 11\u201313.    \n Figure 9.3 The SML and a positive-alpha stock  \nE(r) (%)\nSML\n61415.6\n1.2 1.017Stock\nM\u03b1\n\u03b2\n Yet another use of the CAPM is in utility rate-making cases.  8   In this case the issue is the \nrate of return that a regulated utility should be allowed to earn on its investment in plant \nand equipment. Suppose that the equityholders have invested $100 million in the firm \nand that the beta of the equity is .6. If the T-bill rate is 6% and the market risk premium \nis 8%, then the fair profits to the firm would be assessed as 6\u00a0 1 \u00a0.6\u00a0 3 \u00a08\u00a0 5 \u00a010.8% of the \n$100 million investment, or $10.8 million.

What if the markets are wrong?   \n Investors are rarely praised for their good sense. But for \nthe past two decades a growing number of firms have \nbased their decisions on a model which assumes that peo-\nple are perfectly rational. If they are irrational, are busi-\nnesses making the wrong choices? \n The model, known as the \u201ccapital-asset pricing model,\u201d \nor CAPM, has come to dominate modern finance. Almost \nany manager who wants to defend a project\u2014be it a \nbrand, a factory or a corporate merger\u2014must justify his \ndecision partly based on the CAPM. The reason is that the \nmodel tells a firm how to calculate the return that its inves-\ntors demand. If shareholders are to benefit, the returns \nfrom any project must clear this \u201churdle rate.\u201d \n Although the CAPM is complicated, it can be reduced to \nfive simple ideas:\n    1. Investors can eliminate some risks\u2014such as the risk that \nworkers will strike, or that a firm\u2019s boss will quit\u2014by \ndiversifying across many regions and sectors.  \n   2. Some risks, such as that of a global recession, cannot be \neliminated through diversification. So even a basket of \nall of the stocks in a stock market will still be risky.  \n   3. People must be rewarded for investing in such a risky \nbasket by earning returns above those that they can \nget on safer assets, such as Treasury bills.  \n   4. The rewards on a specific investment depend only on \nthe extent to which it affects the market basket\u2019s risk.  \n   5. Conveniently, that contribution to the market basket\u2019s \nrisk can be captured by a single measure\u2014dubbed \n\u201cbeta\u201d\u2014which expresses the relationship between the \ninvestment\u2019s risk and the market\u2019s.    \n Beta is what makes the CAPM so powerful. Although \nan investment may face many risks, diversified investors \nshould care only about those that are related to the market basket. Beta not only tells managers how to measure those \nrisks, but it also allows them to translate them directly into \na hurdle rate. If the future profits from a project will not \nexceed that rate, it is not worth shareholders\u2019 money.  \n The diagram shows how the CAPM works. Safe invest-\nments, such as Treasury bills, have a beta of zero. Riskier \ninvestments should earn a premium over the risk-free \nrate which increases with beta. Those whose risks roughly \nmatch the market\u2019s have a beta of one, by definition, and \nshould earn the market return. \n So suppose that a firm is considering two projects,  A\nand  B.  Project  A  has a beta of \u00bd: when the market rises \nor falls by 10%, its returns tend to rise or fall by 5%. So \nits risk premium is only half that of the market.

Worse, there appears to be another measure which explains these returns quite well. \n That measure is the ratio of a firm\u2019s book value (the \nvalue of its assets at the time they entered the balance \nsheet) to its market value. Several studies have found that, on average, companies that have high book-to-market ratios tend to earn excess returns over long periods, even after adjusting for the risks that are associated with beta. \n The discovery of this book-to-market effect has sparked \na fierce debate among financial economists. All of them \nagree that some risks ought to carry greater rewards. But they are now deeply divided over how risk should be mea-sured. Some argue that since investors are rational, the book-to-market effect must be capturing an extra risk fac-tor. They conclude, therefore, that managers should incor-porate the book-to-market effect into their hurdle rates. They have labeled this alternative hurdle rate the \u201cnew estimator of expected return,\u201d or NEER. \n Other financial economists, however, dispute this \napproach. Since there is no obvious extra risk associated \nwith a high book-to-market ratio, they say, investors must be mistaken. Put simply, they are underpricing high book-to-market stocks, causing them to earn abnormally high returns. If managers of such firms try to exceed those inflated hurdle rates, they will forgo many profitable investments. With economists now at odds, what is a con-scientious manager to do? \n Jeremy Stein, an economist at the Massachusetts Insti-\ntute of Technology\u2019s business school, offers a paradoxical answer. *  If investors are rational, then beta cannot be the \nonly measure of risk, so managers should stop using it. \nConversely, if investors are irrational, then beta is still the right measure in many cases. Mr. Stein argues that if beta captures an asset\u2019s fundamental risk\u2014that is, its contribu-tion to the market basket\u2019s risk\u2014then it will often make sense for managers to pay attention to it, even if investors are somehow failing to. \n Often, but not always. At the heart of Mr. Stein\u2019s argu-\nment lies a crucial distinction\u2014that between ( a ) boosting a \nfirm\u2019s long-term value and ( b ) trying to raise its share price. \nIf investors are rational, these are the same thing: any deci-\nsion that raises long-term value will instantly increase the share price as well. But if investors are making predictable mistakes, a manager must choose. \n For instance, if he wants to increase today\u2019s share \nprice\u2014perhaps because he wants to sell his shares, or to \nfend off a takeover attempt\u2014he must usually stick with the NEER approach, accommodating investors\u2019 mispercep-tions. But if he is interested in long-term value, he should usually continue to use beta. Showing a flair for market-ing, Mr. Stein labels this far-sighted alternative to NEER the \u201cfundamental asset risk\u201d\u2014or FAR\u2014approach. \n Mr. Stein\u2019s conclusions will no doubt irritate many com-\npany bosses, who are fond of denouncing their investors\u2019 \nmyopia. They have resented the way in which CAPM\u2014with its assumption of investor infallibility\u2014has come to play an important role in boardroom decision making. But it now appears that if they are right, and their investors are wrong, then those same far-sighted managers ought to be the CAPM\u2019s biggest fans. \n  *Jeremy Stein, \u201cRational Capital Budgeting in an Irrational \nWorld,\u201d  The Journal of Business,  October 1996.   \n  Source:  \u201cTales from the FAR Side,\u201d  The Economist Group,  Inc. \nNovember 16, 1996, p. 8. \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited, \nLondon. \n  The CAPM and the Single-Index Market \n The key implications of the CAPM can be summarized by these two statements:\n    1.

We have focused on one direction, proceeding from the efficiency of the market portfolio to the mean-beta equation. We now proceed from the mean return\u2013beta relation-ship to the efficiency of the market portfolio using the index-model market structure we described in Chapter 8. \n Deriving the CAPM is even more intuitive when starting from a single-index market. \nRather than beginning with investors who all apply the Markowitz algorithm to identical input lists, suppose instead that they all face a market where excess stock returns,  R  \n i  , are \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   301bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   301 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\n302 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nnormally distributed and driven by one systematic factor.

Second, by choosing stocks \nwith positive alpha, or taking short positions in negative-alpha stocks, the risk premium on  Q  \ncan be increased.  9    \n As a result of these considerations, investors will relentlessly pursue positive alpha stocks, \nand shun (or short) negative-alpha stocks. Consequently, prices of positive alpha stocks will rise and prices of negative alpha stocks will fall. This will continue until all alpha values are driven to zero. At this point, investors will be content to minimize risk by completely eliminating unique risk, that is, by holding the broadest possible, market portfolio. When all stocks have zero alphas, the market portfolio is the optimal risky portfolio.  \n10      \n  9 The systematic part of the portfolio is of no relevance in this endeavor, since, if desired, the beta of  Q  can be \nincreased by leverage (borrow and invest in  M ), or decreased by including in  Q  a short position in  M.  The pro-\nceeds from the short position in  M  can be invested in the risk-free asset, thus leaving the alpha and nonsystematic \nrisk unchanged. \n  10 Recall from Chapter 8 that the weight of a stock in an active portfolio will be zero if its alpha is zero (see \nEquation 8.20); hence if all alphas are zero, the passive market portfolio will be the optimal risky portfolio.    9.2 Assumptions and Extensions of the CAPM  \n Now that we understand the basic insights of the CAPM, we can more explicitly iden-\ntify the set of simplifying assumptions on which it relies. A model consists of (i) a set of assumptions, (ii) logical/mathematical development of the model through manipulation of those assumptions, and (iii) a set of predictions. Assuming the logical/mathematical manipulations are free of errors, we can test a model in two ways,  normative  and  positive.  \nNormative tests examine the assumptions of the model, while positive tests examine the predictions. \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   302bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   302 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 9 The Capital Asset Pricing Model  303\n If a model\u2019s assumptions are valid, and the development is error-free, then the predic-\ntions of the model must be true. In this case, testing the assumptions is synonymous with \ntesting the model. But few, if any, models can pass the normative test. In most cases, as with the CAPM, the assumptions are admittedly invalid\u2014we recognize that we have simplified reality, and therefore to this extent are relying on \u201cuntrue\u201d assumptions. The motivation for invoking unrealistic assumptions is clear; we simply cannot solve a model that is perfectly consistent with the full complexity of real-life markets. As we\u2019ve noted, the need to use sim-plifying assumptions is not peculiar to economics\u2014it characterizes all of science. \n Assumptions are chosen first and foremost to render the model solvable. But we prefer \nassumptions to which the model is \u201crobust.\u201d A model is robust with respect to an assump-tion if its predictions are not highly sensitive to violation of the assumption. If we use only assumptions to which the model is robust, the model\u2019s predictions will be reason-ably accurate despite its shortcomings. The upshot of all this is that tests of models are almost always positive\u2014we judge a model on the success of its empirical predictions. This standard brings statistics into any science and requires us to take a stand on what are acceptable levels of significance and power.  \n11   Because the nonrealism of the assumptions \nprecludes a normative test, the positive test is really a test of the robustness of the model to its assumptions.   \n   Assumptions of the CAPM \n  Table\u00a09.1  enumerates the list of assumptions underlying the CAPM. In our discussion so far, we have cited explicitly only these three assumptions:\n    1.a. Investors are rational, mean-variance optimizers.  \n   1.c. Investors use identical input lists, referred to as    homogeneous expectations   .  \n   2.a.  All assets are publicly traded (short positions are allowed) and investors can \n borrow or lend at a common risk-free rate.       \n The first assumption is far-reaching. Its \u201cvisible\u201d part is that investors are not concerned \nwith higher moments (skew and kurtosis) that may \u201cfatten\u201d the left tail of the return distri-\nbution. We can ascertain the validity of this assumption from statistical tests of the normal-ity of return distributions as we did in Chapter 5. \n Less visible is that, by assuming that only the mean and variance of wealth matter to \ninvestors, Assumption 1(a) rules out concern with the correlation of asset returns with either inflation or prices of important consumption items such as housing or energy. The extra demand for assets that can be used to hedge these \u201cextra market\u201d risks would increase their prices and reduce their risk premiums relative to the prediction of the CAPM. \n  11 To illustrate the meanings of significance and power, consider a test of the efficacy of a new drug. The agency \ntesting the drug may make two possible errors. The drug may be useless (or even harmful), but the agency may \nconclude that it is useful. This is called a \u201cType I\u201d error. The  significance level  of a test is the probability of a Type \nI error. Typical practice is to fix the level of significance at some low level, for example, 5%. In the case of drug testing, for example, the first goal is to avoid introducing ineffective or harmful treatments. The other possible error is that the drug is actually useful, but the testing procedure concludes it is not. This mistake, called \u201cType II\u201d error, would lead us to discard a useful treatment. The  power  of the test is the probability of avoiding Type II \nerror (i.e., one minus the probability of making such an error), that is, the probability of accepting the drug if it is indeed useful. We want tests that, at a given level of significance, have the most power, so we will admit effec-tive drugs with high probability. In social sciences in particular, available tests often have low power, in which case they are susceptible to Type II error and will reject a correct model (a \u201cuseful drug\u201d) with high frequency. \u201cThe drug is useful\u201d is analogous in the CAPM to alphas being zero. When the test data reject the hypothesis that observed alphas are zero at the desired level of significance, the CAPM fails. However, if the test has low power, the probability that we accept the model when not true is too high. \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   303bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   303 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\n3 0 4 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n Similar extra-market risk factors would arise in a multiperiod model, which requires \nthe addition of Assumption 1(b), limiting investors to a common single-period horizon. \nConsider a possible decline in future interest rates. Investors would be unhappy about this \nevent to the extent that it would reduce the expected income their investments could throw \noff in the future. Assets whose returns are negatively correlated with interest rates (e.g., \nlong-term bonds) would hedge this risk and thus command higher prices and lower risk \npremiums. Because of such hedging demands, correlation with any parameter describing \nfuture investment opportunities can result in violations of the CAPM mean-beta equation \n(and therefore with the efficiency of the market portfolio). A single-period investor horizon \neliminates these possibilities. \n Interestingly, Assumption 1(c) (investors optimize with the same input list), appears \nominously restrictive, but it actually is not all that problematic. With the addition of \nAssumption 2(b) (all information is public), investors generally will be close to agreement. \nMoreover, trades of investors who derive different input lists will offset and prices will \nreflect consensus expectations. We will later allow for the likelihood that some investors \nexpend resources to obtain private information and exploit prices that don\u2019t reflect the \ninsights derived from this information. But regardless of their success, it is reasonable to \nassert that, absent private information, investors should assume alpha values are zero. \n The assumption that all assets are tradable (2a) is essential for identical input lists. \nIt allows us to ignore federal and state assets and liabilities. More importantly, privately \nheld but nontraded assets such as human capital and private business can create large dif-\nferences in investor portfolios. Consider owners of a family business. Prudence dictates \nthat they avoid assets that are highly correlated with their businesses. Similarly, investors \nshould avoid stock returns that are positively correlated with their personal income; for \nexample, Boeing employees should avoid investing in the airline and related businesses. \nDifferential demands arising from this consideration can lead to violation of the mean-beta \nequation and derail the mean-variance efficiency of the index portfolio. \n Restrictions on borrowing (or significantly higher rates on borrowed funds), which vio-\nlates Assumption 2(a), also can create problems for the CAPM, because borrowers and lend-\ners will arrive at different tangency portfolios and thus different optimal risky portfolios. \n Taxes create conditions in which two investors can realize different after-tax returns \nfrom the same stock. Such distortions could, in principle, lead to different after-tax opti-\nmal risky portfolios to different investors; hence Assumption 2(c) (no taxes). Despite an \nextension to the CAPM that incorporates personal taxes on dividends and capital gains,  12\nTable 9.1\nThe assumptions \nof the CAPM1. Individual behavior\na.

A plausible \nexplanation for this negative finding relies on \u201cclientele\u201d and supply effects. If high tax-bracket investors shy away from high-yield (dividend-paying) stocks and thus force down their prices, tax-exempt investors will view the stocks as a bargain and take up the slack in demand. On the other end, if corporations see that high dividend yields reduce stock prices, they simply will substitute stock repurchases for dividends, reinforcing the clientele effect in neutralizing tax effects.  \n Finally, transaction costs inhibit trades and thus the reaction to changes in information; \nhence Assumption 2(d) (no transaction costs). While in reality trading costs have fallen, remaining differentials in trading costs may still play an important role in stock returns.  \n  Challenges and Extensions to the CAPM \n Which assumptions are most worrisome? We start with the fact that short positions are not as easy to take as long ones for three reasons:\n    1. The liability of investors who hold a short position in an asset is potentially unlim-\nited, since the price may rise without limit. Hence a large short position requires large collateral, and proceeds cannot be used to invest in other risky assets.  \n   2. There is a limited supply of shares of any stock to be borrowed by would-be short \nsellers. It often happens that investors simply cannot find shares to borrow in order to short.  \n   3. Many investment companies are prohibited from short sales. The U.S. and other \ncountries further restrict short sales by regulation.    \n Why are short sales important? Notice that Assumption 1(a) begins with \u201cinvestors are \nrational\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d When investors exhibit \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d (excessive optimism) about an asset and, as a result, prices rise above intrinsic values, rational investors will take short positions, thus holding down the price. But with effective restrictions, short sales can fail to prevent prices rising to unsustainable levels that are precursors to a correction or even a crash. This really defines a \u201cbubble.\u201d \n Three unrealistic assumptions, 2(a) (all assets trade) and 2(d) (there are no transac-\ntion costs), combined with 1(b) (single-period horizon), generate the major challenges to the model. These challenges have motivated a set of extensions that are, even today, still \u201cunder construction\u201d in one way or another. For this reason, none of the extensions has decisively superseded the simple CAPM in the industry. It is an impressive phenomenon, that despite failing many empirical tests, the compelling logic of the CAPM keeps it at the center of the investments industry. However, for better insight to the CAPM, it is useful to understand the extensions of the model.  \n  The Zero-Beta Model \n Efficient frontier portfolios have a number of interesting characteristics, independently derived by Merton and Roll.  \n13   Two of these are\n    1. Any portfolio that is a combination of two frontier portfolios is itself on the efficient \nfrontier.  \n   2. Every portfolio on the efficient frontier, except for the global minimum-variance \nportfolio, has a \u201ccompanion\u201d portfolio on the bottom (inefficient) half of the frontier \n  13 Robert C.

Because it is uncorrelated, the companion portfolio \nis referred to as the    zero-beta portfolio    of the efficient portfolio. If we choose \nthe market portfolio  M  and its zero-beta companion portfolio  Z,  then we obtain a \nCAPM-like equation\n    E(ri)2E(rZ)53E(RM)2E(RZ)4 Cov(ri, rM)\nsM25bi3E(rM)2E(rZ)4  (9.12)  \n  Equation 9.12 resembles the SML of the CAPM, except that the risk-free rate is \nreplaced with the expected return on the zero-beta companion of the market-index \nportfolio.     \n Fischer Black used these properties to show that Equation 9.12 is the CAPM equation \nthat results when investors face restrictions on borrowing.  14   In this case, at least some \ninvestors will choose portfolios on the high risk-premium portion of the efficient frontier. Put differently, investors who would otherwise wish to borrow and leverage their portfo-lios but who find it impossible or costly will instead tilt their portfolios toward high-beta stocks and away from low-beta ones. As a result, prices of high beta stocks will rise, and their risk premiums will fall. The SML will be flatter than in the simple CAPM. You see from Equation 9.12 that the risk premium on the market portfolio is smaller (because the expected return on the zero-beta portfolio is greater than the risk-free rate) and therefore the reward to bearing beta risk is smaller.   \n  Labor Income and Nontraded Assets \n Two important asset classes that are  not  traded are human capital and privately held busi-\nnesses. The discounted value of future labor income exceeds the total market value of traded assets. The market value of privately held corporations and businesses is of the same order of magnitude. Human capital and private enterprises are different types of assets with possibly different implications for equilibrium returns on traded securities. \n Privately held businesses may be the lesser of the two sources of departures from the \nCAPM. Suppose that privately held businesses have risk characteristics similar to those of traded assets. In this case, individuals can partially offset the diversification problems posed by their nontraded entrepreneurial assets by reducing their portfolio demand for securities of similar, traded assets. Thus, the CAPM expected return\u2013beta equation may not be greatly disrupted by the presence of entrepreneurial income. \n To the extent that risk characteristics of private enterprises differ from those of traded \nsecurities, a portfolio of traded assets that best hedges the risk of typical private business would enjoy excess demand from the population of private business owners. The price of assets in this portfolio will be bid up relative to the CAPM considerations, and the expected returns on these securities will be lower in relation to their systematic risk. Conversely, securities highly correlated with such risk will have high equilibrium risk premiums and may appear to exhibit positive alphas relative to the conventional SML. In fact, Heaton and Lucas show that adding proprietary income to a standard asset-pricing model improves its predictive performance.  \n15   \n The size of labor income and its special nature is of greater concern for the validity of \nthe CAPM. The possible effect of labor income on equilibrium returns can be appreciated \n  14 Fischer Black, \u201cCapital Market Equilibrium with Restricted Borrowing,\u201d  Journal of Business,  July 1972. \n  15 John Heaton and Deborah Lucas, \u201cPortfolio Choice and Asset Prices: The Importance of Entrepreneurial \nRisk,\u201d  Journal of Finance  55 (June 2000).

Despite the fact that an individual \ncan borrow against labor income (via a home mortgage) and reduce some of the uncertainty about future labor income via life insurance, human capital is less \u201cportable\u201d across time and may be more difficult to hedge using traded securities than nontraded business. This may induce pressure on security prices and result in departures from the CAPM expected return\u2013beta equation. Thus, the demand for stocks of labor-intensive firms with high wage expenses may be good hedges for uncertain labor income, and these stocks may require a lower expected return than predicted by the CAPM. \n Mayers  \n16   derives the equilibrium expected return\u2013beta equation for an economy in \nwhich individuals are endowed with labor income of varying size relative to their nonlabor capital. The resultant SML equation is\n    E(R\ni)5E(RM) Cov(Ri, RM)1PH\nPM Cov (Ri, RH)\nsM21PH\nPM Cov (RM, RH)  (9.13)   \nwhere\n    P   H  \u00a0 5 \u00a0value of aggregate human capital  \n   P   M  \u00a0 5 \u00a0market value of traded assets (market portfolio)  \n   R   H  \u00a0 5 \u00a0excess rate of return on aggregate human capital   \nThe CAPM measure of systematic risk, beta, is replaced in the extended model by an \nadjusted beta that also accounts for covariance with the portfolio of aggregate human capi-tal. Notice that the ratio of human capital to market value of all traded assets,  P  \n H  / P   M  , \nmay well be greater than 1, and hence the effect of the covariance of a security with labor \nincome, Cov( R   i  ,\u00a0 R   H  ), relative to the average, Cov( R   M  ,\u00a0 R   H  ), is likely to be economically \nsignificant. When Cov( R   i  ,\u00a0 R   H  ) is positive, the adjusted beta is greater when the CAPM beta \nis smaller than 1, and vice versa. Because we expect Cov( R   i  ,\u00a0 R   H  ) to be positive for the aver-\nage security, the risk premium in this model will be greater, on average, than predicted by \nthe CAPM for securities with beta less than 1, and smaller for securities with beta greater than 1. The model thus predicts a security market line that is less steep than that of the stan-dard CAPM. This may help explain the average negative alpha of high-beta securities and positive alpha of low-beta securities that lead to the statistical failure of the CAPM equa-tion. In Chapter 13 on empirical evidence we present additional results along these lines.  \n  A Multiperiod Model and Hedge Portfolios \n Robert C. Merton revolutionized financial economics by using continuous-time models to extend models of asset pricing.  \n17   While his (Nobel Prize\u2013winning) contributions to option-\npricing theory and financial engineering (along with those of Fischer Black and Myron Scholes) may have had greater impact on the investment industry, his solo contribution to portfolio theory was equally important for our understanding of the risk\u2013return relationship. \n In his basic model, Merton relaxes the \u201csingle-period\u201d myopic assumptions about inves-\ntors. He envisions individuals who optimize a lifetime consumption/investment plan, and who continually adapt consumption/investment decisions to current wealth and planned retirement age. When uncertainty about portfolio returns is the only source of risk and \n  16 David Mayers, \u201cNonmarketable Assets and Capital Market Equilibrium under Uncertainty,\u201d in  Studies in the \nTheory of Capital Markets,  ed.

These extra risks \nare of two general kinds. One concerns changes in the parameters describing investment opportunities, such as future risk-free rates, expected returns, or the risk of the market portfolio. Suppose that the real interest rate may change over time. If it falls in some future period, one\u2019s level of wealth will now support a lower stream of real consumption. Future spending plans, for example, for retirement spending, may be put in jeopardy. To the extent that returns on some securities are correlated with changes in the risk-free rate, a portfolio can be formed to hedge such risk, and investors will bid up the price (and bid down the expected return) of those hedge assets. Investors will sacrifice some expected return if they can find assets whose returns will be higher when other parameters (in this case, the real risk-free rate) change adversely. \n The other additional source of risk concerns the prices of the consumption goods that \ncan be purchased with any amount of wealth. Consider inflation risk. In addition to the expected level and volatility of nominal wealth, investors must be concerned about the cost of living\u2014what those dollars can buy. Therefore, inflation risk is an important extramarket source of risk, and investors may be willing to sacrifice some expected return to purchase securities whose returns will be higher when the cost of living changes adversely. If so, hedging demands for securities that help to protect against inflation risk would affect port-folio choice and thus expected return. One can push this conclusion even further, arguing that empirically significant hedging demands may arise for important subsectors of con-sumer expenditures; for example, investors may bid up share prices of energy companies that will hedge energy price uncertainty. These sorts of effects may characterize any assets that hedge important extramarket sources of risk. \n More generally, suppose we can identify  K  sources of extramarket risk and find  K  asso-\nciated hedge portfolios. Then, Merton\u2019s ICAPM expected return\u2013beta equation would gen-eralize the SML to a multi-index version:\n    E(R\ni)5biME(RM)1aK\nk51bikE(Rk)  (9.14)  \nwhere  b   iM   is the familiar security beta on the market-index portfolio, and  b   ik   is the beta on \nthe  k th hedge portfolio. \n Other multifactor models using additional factors that do not arise from extramarket \nsources of risk have been developed and lead to SMLs of a form identical to that of the \nICAPM. These models also may be considered extensions of the CAPM in the broad sense. We examine these models in the next chapter.  \n  A Consumption-Based CAPM \n The logic of the CAPM together with the hedging demands noted in the previous subsec-tion suggest that it might be useful to center the model directly on consumption. Such models were first proposed by Mark Rubinstein, Robert Lucas, and Douglas Breeden.  \n19   \n  18 Eugene F. Fama also made this point in \u201cMultiperiod Consumption-Investment Decisions,\u201d  American  Economic \nReview  60 (1970). \n  19 Mark Rubinstein, \u201cThe Valuation of Uncertain Income Streams and the Pricing of Options,\u201d  Bell Journal of \nEconomics and Management Science  7 (1976), pp. 407\u201325; Robert Lucas, \u201cAsset Prices in an Exchange Econ-\nomy,\u201d  Econometrica  46 (1978), pp. 1429\u201345; Douglas Breeden, \u201cAn Intertemporal Asset Pricing Model with \nStochastic Consumption and Investment Opportunities,\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics  7 (1979), pp. 265\u201396. \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   308bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   308 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 9 The Capital Asset Pricing Model  309\n In a lifetime consumption plan, the investor must in each period balance the allocation \nof current wealth between today\u2019s consumption and the savings and investment that will \nsupport future consumption. When optimized, the utility value from an additional dollar of consumption today must be equal to the utility value of the expected future consump-tion that can be financed by that additional dollar of wealth.  \n20   Future wealth will grow \nfrom labor income, as well as returns on that dollar when invested in the optimal complete portfolio.  \n Suppose risky assets are available and you wish to increase expected consumption \ngrowth by allocating some of your savings to a risky portfolio. How would we measure the risk of these assets? As a general rule, investors will value additional income more highly during difficult economic times (when resources are scarce) than in affluent times (when consumption is already abundant). An asset will therefore be viewed as riskier in terms of consumption if it has positive covariance with consumption growth\u2014in other words, if its payoff is higher when consumption is already high and lower when consumption is relatively restricted. Therefore, equilibrium risk premiums will be greater for assets that exhibit higher covariance with consumption growth. Developing this insight, we can write the risk premium on an asset as a function of its \u201cconsumption risk\u201d as follows:\n    E(R\ni)5biCRPC  (9.15)  \nwhere portfolio  C  may be interpreted as a  consumption-tracking portfolio  (also called a \n consumption-mimicking portfolio ), that is, the portfolio with the highest correlation with \nconsumption growth;  b   iC   is the slope coefficient in the regression of asset  i \u2019s excess returns, \n R   i  , on those of the consumption-tracking portfolio; and, finally, RP  C   is the risk premium \nassociated with consumption uncertainty, which is measured by the expected excess return \non the consumption-tracking portfolio:\n    R PC5E(RC)5E(rC)2rf  (9.16)   \n Notice how similar this conclusion is to the conventional CAPM. The consumption-\ntracking portfolio in the CCAPM plays the role of the market portfolio in the conven-\ntional CAPM. This is in accord with its focus on the risk of  consumption  opportunities \nrather than the risk and return of the  dollar  value of the portfolio. The excess return on the \n consumption-tracking portfolio plays the role of the excess return on the market portfolio,  M.  Both approaches result in linear, single-factor models that differ mainly in the identity \nof the factor they use. \n In contrast to the CAPM, the beta of the market portfolio on the market factor of the \nCCAPM is not necessarily 1. It is perfectly plausible and empirically evident that this beta is substantially greater than 1. This means that in the linear relationship between the market-index risk premium and that of the consumption portfolio,\n    E(R\nM)5aM1bMCE(RC)1e M  (9.17)  \nwhere  a   M   and \u00e1  M   allow for empirical deviation from the exact model in Equation 9.15, and \n b   MC   is not necessarily equal to 1. \n Because the CCAPM is so similar to the CAPM, one might wonder about its usefulness. \nIndeed, just as the CAPM is empirically flawed because not all assets are traded, so is the \n  20 Wealth at each point in time equals the market value of assets in the balance sheet plus the present value of \nfuture labor income. These models of consumption and investment decisions are often made tractable by assum-\ning investors exhibit constant relative risk aversion, or CRRA. CRRA implies that an individual invests a constant proportion of wealth in the optimal risky portfolio regardless of the level of wealth. You might recall that our prescription for optimal capital allocation in Chapter 6 also called for an optimal investment proportion in the risky portfolio regardless of the level of wealth. The utility function we employed there also exhibited CRRA. \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   309bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   309 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\n310 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nCCAPM. The attractiveness of this model is in that it compactly incorporates consump-\ntion hedging and possible changes in investment opportunities, that is, in the parameters of the return distributions in a single-factor framework. There is a price to pay for this compactness, however. Consumption growth figures are published infrequently (monthly at the most) compared with financial assets, and are measured with significant error. Nevertheless, recent empirical research  \n21   indicates that this model is more successful in \nexplaining realized returns than the CAPM, which is a reason why students of investments should be familiar with it. We return to this issue, as well as empirical evidence concerning the CCAPM, in Chapter 13.   \n  Liquidity and the CAPM \n Despite Assumption 2(d) saying that securities can be traded costlessly, the CAPM has little to say about trading activity. In the equilibrium of the CAPM, all investors share all available information and demand identical portfolios of risky assets. The awkward implication of this result is that there is no reason for trade. If all investors hold identical portfolios of risky assets, then when new (unexpected) information arrives, prices will change commensurately, but each investor will continue to hold a piece of the market portfolio, which requires no exchange of assets. How do we square this implication with the observation that on a typical day, trading volume amounts to several billion shares? One obvious answer is heterogeneous expectations, that is, beliefs not shared by the entire market. Diverse beliefs will give rise to trading as investors attempt to profit by rearranging portfolios in accordance with their now-heterogeneous demands. In reality, trading (and trading costs) will be of great importance to investors. \n The    liquidity    of an asset is the ease and speed with which it can be sold at fair market \nvalue. Part of liquidity is the cost of engaging in a transaction, particularly the bid\u2013ask spread. Another part is price impact\u2014the adverse movement in price one would encoun-ter when attempting to execute a larger trade. Yet another component is immediacy\u2014the ability to sell the asset quickly without reverting to fire-sale prices. Conversely,    illiquidity    \ncan be measured in part by the discount from fair market value a seller must accept if the asset is to be sold quickly. A perfectly liquid asset is one that would entail no illiquidity discount. \n Liquidity (or the lack of it) has long been recognized as an important characteristic \nthat affects asset values. In legal cases, courts have routinely applied very steep discounts to the values of businesses that cannot be publicly traded. But liquidity has not always been appreciated as an important factor in security markets, presumably due to the rela-tively small trading cost per transaction compared with the large costs of trading assets such as real estate. The breakthrough came in the work of Amihud and Mendelson  \n22   and \ntoday, liquidity is increasingly viewed as an important determinant of prices and expected returns. We supply only a brief synopsis of this important topic here and provide empirical evidence in Chapter 13. \n One important component of trading cost is the bid\u2013ask spread. For example, in elec-\ntronic markets, the limit-order book contains the \u201cinside spread,\u201d that is, the difference between the highest price at which some investor will purchase any shares and the  lowest \n  21 Ravi Jagannathan and Yong Wang, \u201cLazy Investors, Discretionary Consumption, and the Cross-Section of \nStock Returns,\u201d  Journal of Finance  62 (August 2007), pp. 1633\u201361. \n  22 Yakov Amihud and Haim Mendelson, \u201cAsset Pricing and the Bid\u2013Ask Spread,\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics   \n17 (1986).

The effective bid\u2013ask spread will also \ndepend on the size of the desired transaction. Larger purchases will require a trader to move deeper into the limit-order book and accept less-attractive prices. While inside spreads on electronic markets often appear extremely low, effective spreads can be much larger, because most limit orders are good for only small numbers of shares. \n There is greater emphasis today on the component of the spread due to asymmetric \ninformation. Asymmetric information is the potential for one trader to have private informa-tion about the value of the security that is not known to the trading partner. To see why such an asymmetry can affect the market, think about the problems facing someone buying a used car. The seller knows more about the car than the buyer, so the buyer naturally won-ders if the seller is trying to get rid of the car because it is a \u201clemon.\u201d At the least, buyers worried about overpaying will shave the prices they are willing to pay for a car of uncer-tain quality. In extreme cases of asymmetric information, trading may cease altogether.  \n23   \nSimilarly, traders who post offers to buy or sell at limit prices need to be worried about being picked off by better-informed traders who hit their limit prices only when they are out of line with the intrinsic value of the firm.  \n Broadly speaking, we may envision investors trading securities for two reasons. Some \ntrades are driven by \u201cnoninformational\u201d motives, for example, selling assets to raise cash for a big purchase, or even just for portfolio rebalancing. These sorts of trades, which are not motivated by private information that bears on the value of the traded security, are called  noise trades.  Security dealers will earn a profit from the bid\u2013ask spread when trans-\nacting with noise traders (also called  liquidity traders  because their trades may derive from \nneeds for liquidity, i.e., cash). \n Other transactions are initiated by traders who believe they have come across informa-\ntion that a security is mispriced. But if that information gives them an advantage, it must be disadvantageous to the other party in the transaction. In this manner, information trad-ers impose a cost on both dealers and other investors who post limit orders. Although on average dealers make money from the bid\u2013ask spread when transacting with liquidity trad-ers, they will absorb losses from information traders. Similarly, any trader posting a limit order is at risk from information traders. The response is to increase limit-ask prices and decrease limit-bid orders\u2014in other words, the spread must widen. The greater the relative importance of information traders, the greater the required spread to compensate for the potential losses from trading with them. In the end, therefore, liquidity traders absorb most of the cost of the information trades because the bid\u2013ask spread that they must pay on their \u201cinnocent\u201d trades widens when informational asymmetry is more severe. \n The discount in a security price that results from illiquidity can be surprisingly large, far \nlarger than the bid\u2013ask spread. Consider a security with a bid\u2013ask spread of 1%. Suppose it will change hands once a year for the next 3 years and then will be held forever by the third buyer. For the last trade, the investor will pay for the security 99.5% or .995 of its fair price; the price is reduced by half the spread that will be incurred when the stock is sold. The second buyer, knowing the security will be sold a year later for .995 of fair value, and having to absorb half the spread upon purchase, will be willing to pay .995\u00a0 2 \u00a0.005/1.05\u00a0 5 \u00a0.9902 (i.e., 99.02% of fair value), if the spread from fair value is dis-\ncounted at a rate of 5%. Finally, the current buyer, knowing the loss next year, when the stock will be sold for .9902 of fair value (a discount of .0098), will pay for the security only .995\u00a0 2 \u00a0.0098/1.05\u00a0 5 \u00a0.9857. Thus the discount has ballooned from .5% to 1.43%. In other \n  23 The problem of informational asymmetry in markets was introduced by the 2001 Nobel laureate George A. \nAkerlof and has since become known as the  lemons problem.

At an annual discount rate of 5%, this sum equals .005\u00a0 1 \u00a0.005/.05\u00a0 5 \u00a0.105, or 10.5%! \nObviously, liquidity is of potentially large value and should not be ignored in deriving the \nequilibrium value of securities.  \n As trading costs are higher, the illiquidity discount will be greater. Of course, if some-\none can buy a share at a lower price, the expected rate of return will be higher. Therefore, \nwe should expect to see less-liquid securities offer higher average rates of return. But this \nilliquidity premium need not rise in direct proportion to trading cost. If an asset is less \nliquid, it will be shunned by frequent traders and held instead by longer term traders who \nare less affected by high trading costs. Hence in equilibrium, investors with long holding \nperiods will, on average, hold more of the illiquid securities, while short-horizon inves-\ntors will prefer liquid securities. This \u201cclientele effect\u201d mitigates the effect of the bid\u2013ask \nspread for illiquid securities. The end result is that the liquidity premium should increase \nwith trading costs (measured by the bid\u2013ask spread) at a decreasing rate.  Figure\u00a09.4  con-\nfirms this prediction.  \n So far, we have shown that the expected level of liquidity can affect prices, and there-\nfore expected rates of return. What about unanticipated  changes   in liquidity? In some \ncircumstances, liquidity can unexpectedly dry up. For example, in the financial crisis of \n2008, as many investors attempted to reduce leverage and cash out their positions, finding \nbuyers for some assets became difficult. Many mortgage-backed securities stopped trading \n Figure 9.4 The relationship between illiquidity and average returns \n  Source: Derived from Yakov Amihud and Haim Mendelson, \u201cAsset Pricing and the Bid\u2013Ask Spread,\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics   17 \n(1986), pp. 223\u201349.

Liquidity had evaporated. Nor was this an unheard-of phenomenon. The market \ncrash of 1987, as well as the failure of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, also saw large declines in liquidity across broad segments of the market. \n In fact, several studies have investigated variation in a number of measures of liquidity \nfor large samples of stocks and found that when liquidity in one stock decreases, it tends to decrease in other stocks at the same time; thus liquidity across stocks shows significant cor-relation.  \n25   In other words, variation in liquidity has an important systematic component. Not \nsurprisingly, investors demand compensation for exposure to  liquidity risk.   The extra expected \nreturn for bearing liquidity risk modifies the CAPM expected return\u2013beta relationship.  \n Following up on this insight, Amihud demonstrates that firms with greater liquidity \nuncertainty have higher average returns.  26   Later studies focus on exposure to  marketwide   \nliquidity risk, as measured by a \u201cliquidity beta.\u201d Analogously to a traditional market beta, the liquidity beta measures the sensitivity of a firm\u2019s returns to changes in market liquidity (whereas the traditional beta measures return sensitivity to the market return). Firms that provide better returns when market liquidity falls offer some protection against liquidity risk, and thus should be priced higher and offer lower expected returns. In fact, we will see in Chapter 13 that firms with high liquidity betas have offered higher average returns, just as theory predicts.  \n27   Moreover, the liquidity premium that emerges from these studies \nappears to be of roughly the same order of magnitude as the market risk premium, suggest-ing that liquidity should be a first-order consideration when thinking about security pricing.    \n  25 See, for example, Tarun Chordia, Richard Roll, and Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, \u201cCommonality in Liquidity,\u201d \n Journal of Financial Economics  56 (2000), pp. 3\u201328, or J.

In reality, we cannot even observe all the assets that do trade, let alone properly account for those that do not. The theoretical market portfolio, which is central to the CAPM, is impossible to pin down in practice. \n Since the theoretical CAPM market portfolio cannot be observed, tests of the CAPM \nmust be directed at the mean-beta relationship as applied to all observed assets with respect to an observed, but perhaps inefficient, stock index portfolio. These tests face surprisingly difficult hurdles. \n The objective is to test the SML equation,  E ( R  \n i  )\u00a0 5 \u00a0 b   i   R   M  . We do so with a regression of \nexcess returns of a sample of stocks ( i \u00a0 5 \u00a01,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0,\u00a0 N ) over a given period,  t,  against the betas \nof each stock:\n    Ri,t5l01l1bi1l2sei21hi,t  (9.18)  \nThe CAPM predicts that (1)  l  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a00, that is, the average alpha in the sample will be zero; \n(2)  l  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 R   M  , that is, the slope of the SML equals the market-index risk premium; and \n(3)  l  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a00, that is, unique risk,    sei2,  doesn\u2019t earn a risk premium.  h   i   is the zero-mean \nresidual of this regression. \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   313bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   313 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\n314 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n Where, you may ask, do we obtain the beta coefficients and residual variances for the \n N  stocks in the regression? We have to estimate this pair for each stock from a time series \nof stock returns. And therein lies the snag: We estimate these parameters with large errors. Moreover, these errors may be correlated: First, beta may be correlated with the residual variance of each stock (as well as errors in these estimates), and second, the error terms in the regression may be correlated across stocks. These measurement errors can result in a downward bias in the slope of the SML ( l  \n1 ), and an upward bias in the average alpha ( l  0 ). \nWe can\u2019t even predict the sign of the bias in ( l  2 ). \n An example of this hazard was pointed out in an early paper by Miller and Scholes,  28   \nwho demonstrated how econometric problems could lead one to reject the CAPM even if it were perfectly valid. They considered a checklist of difficulties encountered in testing the model and showed how these problems potentially could bias conclusions. To prove the point, they simulated rates of return that were constructed to satisfy the predictions of the CAPM and used these rates to test the model with standard statistical techniques of the day. The result of these tests was a rejection of the model that looks surprisingly similar to what we find in tests of returns from actual data\u2014this despite the fact that the data were constructed to satisfy the CAPM. Miller and Scholes thus demonstrated that econometric technique alone could be responsible for the rejection of the model in actual tests.  \n Moreover, both coefficients, alpha and beta, as well as residual variance, are likely time \nvarying. There is nothing in the CAPM that precludes such time variation, but standard regression techniques rule it out and thus may lead to false rejection of the model. There are now well-known techniques to account for time-varying parameters. In fact, Robert Engle won the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on econometric techniques to deal with time-varying volatility, and a good portion of the applications of these new tech-niques have been in finance.  \n29   Moreover, betas may vary not purely randomly over time, \nbut in response to changing economic conditions. A \u201cconditional\u201d CAPM allows risk and return to change with a set of \u201cconditioning variables.\u201d  \n30   As importantly, Campbell and \nVuolteenaho  31   find that the beta of a security can be decomposed into two components, \none that measures sensitivity to changes in corporate profitability and another that mea-sures sensitivity to changes in the market\u2019s discount rates. These are found to be quite different in many cases. Improved econometric techniques such as those proposed in this short survey may help resolve part of the empirical failure of the simple CAPM. \n A strand of research that has not yet yielded fruit is the search for portfolios that hedge the \nprice risk of specific consumption items, as in Merton\u2019s Equation 9.14. But the jury is still out on the empirical content of this equation with respect to future investment opportunities. \n As mentioned in Chapter 5, Fama and French documented the explanatory power of \nsize and book-to-market ratios (B/M). They interpret portfolios formed to align with these characteristics as hedging portfolios in the context of Equation 9.14. Following their lead, other papers have now suggested a number of other extra-market risk factors (discussed in the next chapter). But we don\u2019t really know what uncertainties in future investment oppor-tunities are hedged by these factors, leading many to be skeptical of empirically driven identification of extra-market hedging portfolios. \n  28 Merton H.

We don\u2019t yet know, however, what shape the successful extension to replace it will \ntake. Stay tuned for future editions of this text.   \n   9.4 The CAPM and the Investment Industry  \n While academics have been riding multiple-index models in search of a CAPM that best \nexplains returns, the industry has steadfastly stayed with the single-index CAPM. \n This interesting phenomenon can be explained by a \u201ctest of the non-testable.\u201d Presumably, \nthe CAPM tenet that the market portfolio is efficient cannot be tested because the true mar-\nket portfolio cannot be observed in the first place. But as time has passed, it has become \never more evident that consistently beating a (not very broad) index portfolio such as the \nS&P 500 appears to be beyond the power of most investors. \n Indirect evidence on the efficiency of the market portfolio can be found in a study by \nBurton Malkiel,  32   who estimates alpha values for a large sample of equity mutual funds. \nThe results, which appear in  Figure\u00a09.5 , show that the distribution of alphas is roughly bell \nshaped, with a mean that is slightly negative but statistically indistinguishable from zero. \nOn average, it does not appear that mutual funds outperform the market index (the S&P \n500) on a risk-adjusted basis.  33     \n  32 Burton G.

This suggests the \naverage alpha from this sample would be upward biased because funds that failed after less than 10 years were \nignored and omitted from the left tail of the distribution. This  survivorship bias   makes the finding that the average \nfund underperformed the index even more telling. We discuss survivorship bias further in Chapter 11. \n Figure 9.5 Estimates of individual mutual fund alphas, 1972\u20131991.

While we might expect realized alpha values of indi-\nvidual securities to center around zero, professionally managed mutual funds might be \nexpected to demonstrate average positive alphas. Funds with superior performance (and we do expect this set to be nonempty) should tilt the sample average to a positive value. The small impact of superior funds on this distribution suggests the difficulty in beating the passive strategy that the CAPM deems to be optimal. \n From the standpoint of the industry, an index portfolio that can be beaten by only a \nsmall fraction of professional managers over a 10-year period may well be taken as ex-ante efficient for all practical purposes, that is, to be used as: (1) a diversification vehicle to mix with an active portfolio from security analysis (discussed in Chapter 8); (2) a benchmark for performance evaluation and compensation (discussed in Chapter 24); (3) a means to adjudicate law suits about fair compensation to various risky enterprises; and (4) a means to determine proper prices in regulated industries, allowing shareholders to earn a fair rate of return on their investments, but no more.    \n   SUMMARY            1 .   The CAPM assumes that investors are single-period planners who agree on a common input list \nfrom security analysis and seek mean-variance optimal portfolios.  \n   2 .  The CAPM assumes that security markets are ideal in the sense that:\n     a .   They are large, and investors are price-takers.  \n    b .   There are no taxes or transaction costs.  \n    c.  All risky assets are publicly traded.  \n    d.  Investors can borrow and lend any amount at a fixed risk-free rate.     \n   3 .  With these assumptions, all investors hold identical risky portfolios. The CAPM holds that in \nequilibrium the market portfolio is the unique mean-variance efficient tangency portfolio. Thus a passive strategy is efficient.  \n   4 .  The CAPM market portfolio is a value-weighted portfolio. Each security is held in a proportion equal to its market value divided by the total market value of all securities.  \n   5 .  If the market portfolio is efficient and the average investor neither borrows nor lends, then the risk premium on the market portfolio is proportional to its variance,    s\nM2,  and to the average coefficient \nof risk aversion across investors,  A: \n   E(rM)2rf5AsM2   \n   6 .  The CAPM implies that the risk premium on any individual asset or portfolio is the product of the risk premium on the market portfolio and the beta coefficient:\n   E(r\ni)2rf5bi3E(rM)2rf4 \n  where the beta coefficient is the covariance of the asset with the market portfolio as a fraction of the variance of the market portfolio:\n   b\ni5Cov(ri, rM)\nsM2   \n   7 .  When risk-free investments are restricted but all other CAPM assumptions hold, then the simple \nversion of the CAPM is replaced by its zero-beta version. Accordingly, the risk-free rate in the expected return\u2013beta relationship is replaced by the zero-beta portfolio\u2019s expected rate of return:\n E( r\ni ) 5 E(r Z) 1 b i[E(r M) 2 E(r Z)]   \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   316bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   316 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 9 The Capital Asset Pricing Model  317\n   Market risk premium:    E(RM)5AsM2   \n  Beta:    b i5Cov(Ri, RM)\nsM2   \n  Security market line:    E(ri)5rf1bi3E(rM)2rf4   \n  Zero-beta SML:    E(ri)5E(rZ)1bi3E(rM)2E(rZ)4   \n  Multifactor SML (in excess returns):    E(Ri)5biM E(RM)1aK\nk51E(Rk)        8 .   The simple version of the CAPM assumes that investors have a single-period time hori-\nzon. When investors are assumed to be concerned with lifetime consumption and bequest plans, but investors\u2019 tastes and security return distributions are stable over time, the market portfolio remains efficient and the simple version of the expected return\u2013beta relationship holds. But if those distributions change unpredictably, or if investors seek to hedge nonmar-ket sources of risk to their consumption, the simple CAPM will give way to a multifactor version in which the security\u2019s exposure to these nonmarket sources of risk command risk premiums.  \n    9 .   The consumption-based capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) is a single-factor model in which the market portfolio excess return is replaced by that of a consumption-tracking port-folio. By appealing directly to consumption, the model naturally incorporates consumption-hedging considerations and changing investment opportunities within a single-factor framework.  \n    10.

We can characterize the entire population by two representative investors.

The uninformed investor does not know what input the informed investor uses to make portfolio purchases. The uninformed investor knows, however, that if the other investor is informed, the market portfolio proportions will be optimal. Therefore, to depart from these proportions would constitute an uninformed bet, which will, on average, reduce the efficiency of diversification with no compensating improvement in expected returns.  \nbod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   322bod61671_ch09_291-323.indd   322 6/21/13   3:39 PM6/21/13   3:39 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 9 The Capital Asset Pricing Model 323\n   2 .      a.

It involves the simultane-ous purchase and sale of equivalent securi-ties in order to profit from discrepancies in their prices. Perhaps the most basic principle of capital market theory is that equilibrium market prices are rational in that they rule out arbitrage opportunities. If actual secu-rity prices allow for arbitrage, the result will be strong pressure to restore equilibrium. Therefore, security markets ought to satisfy a \u201cno-arbitrage condition.\u201d In this chapter, we show how such no-arbitrage conditions together with the factor model introduced in Chapter 8 allow us to generalize the security market line of the CAPM to gain richer insight into the risk\u2013return relationship. \n We begin by showing how the decompo-\nsition of risk into market versus firm-specific \ninfluences that we introduced in earlier  chapters can be extended to deal with the \nmultifaceted nature of systematic risk. Mul-tifactor models of security returns can be used to measure and manage exposure to each of many economywide factors such as business-cycle risk, interest or inflation rate risk, energy price risk, and so on. These models also lead us to a multifactor version of the security market line in which risk premiums derive from exposure to multiple risk sources, each with their own risk premium. \n We show how factor models combined \nwith a no-arbitrage condition lead to a simple \nrelationship between expected return and risk. This approach to the risk\u2013return trade-off is called arbitrage pricing theory, or APT. In a single-factor market where there are no extra-market risk factors, the APT leads to a mean return\u2013beta equation identical to that of the CAPM. In a multifactor market with one or more extra-market risk factors, the APT delivers a mean-beta equation similar to Merton\u2019s intertemporal extension of the CAPM (his ICAPM). We ask next what factors are likely to be the most important sources of risk. These will be the factors generating substantial hedging demands that brought us to the multifactor CAPM introduced in Chapter 9. Both the APT and the CAPM there-fore can lead to multiple-risk versions of the security market line, thereby enriching the insights we can derive about the risk\u2013return relationship.

In the single-index model, the return on a broad market-index portfolio summarized the impact of the macro factor. In Chapter 9 we introduced the possibility that asset-risk premiums may also depend on correlations with extra-market risk factors, such as inflation, or changes in the parameters describing future investment opportunities: interest rates, volatility, market-risk premiums, and betas. For example, returns on an asset whose return increases when inflation increases can be used to hedge uncertainty in the future inflation rate. Its risk premium may fall as a result of investors\u2019 extra demand for this asset. \n Risk premiums of individual securities should reflect their sensitivities to changes in \nextra-market risk factors just as their betas on the market index determine their risk premi-ums in the simple CAPM. When securities can be used to hedge these factors, the resulting hedging demands will make the SML multifactor, with each risk source that can be hedged adding an additional factor to the SML. Risk factors can be represented either by returns on these hedge portfolios (just as the index portfolio represents the market factor), or more directly by changes in the risk factors themselves, for example, changes in interest rates or\u00a0inflation.  \n   Factor Models of Security Returns \n We begin with a familiar single-factor model like the one introduced in Chapter 8. Uncer-tainty in asset returns has two sources: a common or macroeconomic factor and firm-specific events. The common factor is constructed to have zero expected value, because we use it to measure  new  information concerning the macroeconomy, which, by definition, \nhas zero expected value. \n If we call  F  the deviation of the common factor from its expected value,  b  \n i   the sensi-\ntivity of firm  i  to that factor, and  e   i   the firm-specific disturbance, the factor model states \nthat the actual excess return on firm  i  will equal its initially expected value plus a (zero \nexpected value) random amount attributable to unanticipated economywide events, plus \nanother (zero expected value) random amount attributable to firm-specific events. \n Formally, the    single-factor model    of excess returns is described by Equation 10.1:   \n Ri5E(Ri)1biF1ei  (10.1)  \nwhere  E ( R   i  ) is the expected excess return on stock  i.  Notice that if the macro factor has a \nvalue of 0 in any particular period (i.e., no macro surprises), the excess return on the secu-\nrity will equal its previously expected value,  E ( R   i  ), plus the effect of firm-specific events \nonly. The nonsystematic components of returns, the  e   i  s, are assumed to be uncorrelated \nacross stocks and with the factor  F.        10.1 Multifactor Models: An Overview \n To make the factor model more concrete, consider an example. Suppose that the macro \nfactor,  F,  is taken to be news about the state of the business cycle, measured by the \nunexpected percentage change in gross domestic product (GDP), and that the consen-\nsus is that GDP will increase by 4% this year. Suppose also that a stock\u2019s  b  value is 1.2.

Indeed, \nwhen we motivated systematic risk as the source of risk premiums in Chapter 9, we noted that extra market sources of risk may arise from a number of sources such as uncertainty about interest rates, inflation, and so on. The market return reflects macro factors as well as the average sensitivity of firms to those factors. \n It stands to reason that a more explicit representation of systematic risk, allowing for \ndifferent stocks to exhibit different sensitivities to its various components, would constitute a useful refinement of the single-factor model. It is easy to see that models that allow for several factors\u2014   multifactor models   \u2014can provide better descriptions of security returns. \n Apart from their use in building models of equilibrium security pricing, multifactor \nmodels are useful in risk management applications. These models give us a simple way to measure investor exposure to various macroeconomic risks and construct portfolios to hedge those risks. \n Let\u2019s start with a two-factor model. Suppose the two most important macroeconomic \nsources of risk are uncertainties surrounding the state of the business cycle, news of which we will again measure by unanticipated growth in GDP and changes in interest rates. We will denote by IR any unexpected change in interest rates. The return on any stock will respond both to sources of macro risk and to its own firm-specific influences. We can write a two-factor model describing the excess return on stock  i  in some time period as follows:   \n R\ni5E(Ri)1biGDPGDP1biIRIR1ei  (10.2)   \n The two macro factors on the right-hand side of the equation comprise the system-\natic factors in the economy. As in the single-factor model, both of these macro factors have zero expectation: They represent changes in these variables that have not already been anticipated. The coefficients of each factor in Equation 10.2 measure the sensitivity of share \nreturns to that factor. For this reason the coefficients are sometimes called    factor loadings    \nor, equivalently,    factor betas.    An increase in interest rates is bad news for most firms, so \nwe would expect interest rate betas generally to be negative. As before,  e  \n i   reflects firm-\nspecific influences. \n To illustrate the advantages of multifactor models, consider two firms, one a regulated \nelectric-power utility in a mostly residential area, the other an airline. Because residential \ndemand for electricity is not very sensitive to the business cycle, the utility has a low beta If GDP increases by only 3%, then the value of  F  would be  2 1%, representing a 1% \ndisappointment in actual growth versus expected growth. Given the stock\u2019s beta value, \nthis disappointment would translate into a return on the stock that is 1.2% lower than previously expected. This macro surprise, together with the firm-specific disturbance,  e  \n i  , \ndetermines the total departure of the stock\u2019s return from its originally expected value. \n Suppose you currently expect the stock in Example 10.1 to earn a 10% rate of return. Then some \n macroeconomic news suggests that GDP growth will come in at 5% instead of 4%. How will you revise \nyour estimate of the stock\u2019s expected rate of return?

But the utility\u2019s stock price may have a relatively high sensitivity to interest rates. \nBecause the cash flow generated by the utility is relatively stable, its present value behaves much like that of a bond, varying inversely with interest rates. Conversely, the performance of the airline is very sensitive to economic activity but is less sensitive to interest rates. It will have a high GDP beta and a lower interest rate beta. Suppose that on a particular day, a news item suggests that the economy will expand. GDP is expected to increase, but so are interest rates. Is the \u201cmacro news\u201d on this day good or bad? For the utility, this is bad news: Its dominant sensitivity is to rates. But for the airline, which responds more to GDP, this is good news. Clearly a one-factor or single-index model cannot capture such differential responses to varying sources of macroeconomic uncertainty.  \n  1 Stephen A. Ross, \u201cReturn, Risk and Arbitrage,\u201d in I. Friend and J. Bicksler, eds.,  Risk and Return in Finance  \n(Cambridge, MA: Ballinger, 1976).  Factor betas can provide a framework for a hedging strategy. The idea for an investor \nwho wishes to hedge a source of risk is to establish an opposite factor exposure to offset that particular source of risk. Often, futures contracts can be used to hedge particular factor exposures. We explore this application in Chapter 22. \n As it stands, however, the multifactor model is no more than a  description  of the fac-\ntors that affect security returns. There is no \u201ctheory\u201d in the equation. The obvious question left unanswered by a factor model like Equation 10.2 is where  E ( R ) comes from, in other \nwords, what determines a security\u2019s expected excess rate of return. This is where we need a theoretical model of equilibrium security returns. We therefore now turn to arbitrage pric-ing theory to help determine the expected value,  E ( R ), in Equations 10.1 and 10.2.    \n   10.2 Arbitrage Pricing Theory  \n Stephen Ross developed the    arbitrage pricing theory    (APT) in 1976.  1   Like the CAPM, \nthe APT predicts a security market line linking expected returns to risk, but the path it takes to the SML is quite different. Ross\u2019s APT relies on three key propositions: (1) security returns can be described by a factor model; (2) there are sufficient securities to diversify away idiosyncratic risk; and (3) well-functioning security markets do not allow for the per-sistence of arbitrage opportunities. We begin with a simple version of Ross\u2019s model, which assumes that only one systematic factor affects security returns.\n    Suppose we estimate the two-factor model in Equation 10.2 for Northeast Airlines and \nfind the following result:   \nR\u00a05\u00a0.133 1 1.2(GDP)\u00a02\u00a0.3(IR)\u00a01\u00a0e \nThis tells us that, based on currently available information, the expected excess rate of return for Northeast is 13.3%, but that for every percentage point increase in GDP beyond current  expectations, the return on Northeast shares increases on average by 1.2%, while for every unanticipated percentage point that interest rates increases, Northeast\u2019s shares fall on average by .3%.

A trivial example of an arbitrage opportunity would arise if shares of a stock sold for different prices on two different exchanges. For example, suppose IBM sold for $195 on the NYSE but only $193 on NASDAQ. Then you could buy the shares on NASDAQ and simultaneously sell them on the NYSE, clearing a riskless profit of $2 per share without tying up any of your own capital. The    Law of One Price    states that if two \nassets are equivalent in all economically relevant respects, then they should have the same market price. The Law of One Price is enforced by arbitrageurs: If they observe a violation of the law, they will engage in  arbitrage activity \u2014simultaneously buying the asset where it \nis cheap and selling where it is expensive. In the process, they will bid up the price where it is low and force it down where it is high until the arbitrage opportunity is eliminated. \n The idea that market prices will move to rule out arbitrage opportunities is perhaps the \nmost fundamental concept in capital market theory. Violation of this restriction would indi-cate the grossest form of market irrationality. \n The critical property of a risk-free arbitrage portfolio is that any investor, regardless of \nrisk aversion or wealth, will want to take an infinite position in it. Because those large posi-tions will quickly force prices up or down until the opportunity vanishes, security prices should satisfy a \u201cno-arbitrage condition,\u201d that is, a condition that rules out the existence of arbitrage opportunities. \n There is an important difference between arbitrage and risk\u2013return dominance argu-\nments in support of equilibrium price relationships. A dominance argument holds that when an equilibrium price relationship is violated, many investors will make limited port-folio changes, depending on their degree of risk aversion. Aggregation of these limited portfolio changes is required to create a large volume of buying and selling, which in turn restores equilibrium prices. By contrast, when arbitrage opportunities exist, each inves-tor wants to take as large a position as possible; hence it will not take many investors to bring about the price pressures necessary to restore equilibrium. Therefore, implications for prices derived from no-arbitrage arguments are stronger than implications derived from a risk\u2013return dominance argument. \n The CAPM is an example of a dominance argument, implying that all investors hold \nmean-variance efficient portfolios. If a security is mispriced, then investors will tilt their portfolios toward the underpriced and away from the overpriced securities. Pressure on equilibrium prices results from many investors shifting their portfolios, each by a relatively small dollar amount. The assumption that a large number of investors are mean-variance optimizers is critical. In contrast, the implication of a no-arbitrage condition is that a few investors who identify an arbitrage opportunity will mobilize large dollar amounts and quickly restore equilibrium. \n Practitioners often use the terms  arbitrage  and  arbitrageurs  more loosely than our strict \ndefinition. Arbitrageur often refers to a professional searching for mispriced securities in specific areas such as merger-target stocks, rather than to one who seeks strict (risk-free) arbitrage opportunities. Such activity is sometimes called    risk arbitrage    to distinguish it \nfrom pure arbitrage. \n To leap ahead, in Part Four we will discuss \u201cderivative\u201d securities such as futures and \noptions, whose market values are determined by prices of other securities. For example, the value of a call option on a stock is determined by the price of the stock. For such secu-rities, strict arbitrage is a practical possibility, and the condition of no-arbitrage leads to exact pricing. In the case of stocks and other \u201cprimitive\u201d securities whose values are not determined strictly by another bundle of assets, no-arbitrage conditions must be obtained by appealing to diversification arguments.  \nbod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   328bod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   328 6/21/13   3:43 PM6/21/13   3:43 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 10 Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Multifactor Models of Risk and Return 329\n  Well-Diversified Portfolios \n Consider the risk of a portfolio of stocks in a single-factor market. We first show that if a \nportfolio is well diversified, its firm-specific or nonfactor risk becomes negligible, so that only factor (or systematic) risk remains. The excess return on an  n -stock portfolio with \nweights  w  \n i   ,\u00a0S w   i  \u00a0 5 \u00a01, is   \n RP5E(RP)1bPF1eP  (10.3)  \nwhere   \nbP5gwibi;\u00a0 E(RP)5gwiE(Ri) \nare the weighted averages of the  b   i   and risk premiums of the  n  securities. The portfolio \nnonsystematic component (which is uncorrelated with  F  ) is  e   P  \u00a0 5 \u00a0S w   i   e   i   , which similarly is \na weighted average of the  e   i   of the  n  securities. \n We can divide the variance of this portfolio into systematic and nonsystematic sources:   \nsP25bP2sF21s2(eP) \nwhere    s F2  is the variance of the factor  F  and  s  2 ( e   P  ) is the nonsystematic risk of the portfo-\nlio, which is given by   \ns2(eP)5Variance (gwiei)5gwi2s2(ei) \nNote that in deriving the nonsystematic variance of the portfolio, we depend on the fact \nthat the firm-specific  e   i  s are uncorrelated and hence that the variance of the \u201cportfolio\u201d of \nnonsystematic  e   i  s is the weighted sum of the individual nonsystematic variances with the \n square  of the investment proportions as weights. \n If the portfolio were equally weighted,  w   i  \u00a0 5 \u00a01/ n,  then the nonsystematic variance would be   \n   s2(eP)5Variance (gwiei)5aa1\nnb2\ns2(ei)51\nnas2(ei)\nn51\nn s2(ei)\nwhere the last term is the average value of nonsystematic variance across securities. In \nwords, the nonsystematic variance of the portfolio equals the average nonsystematic vari-ance divided by  n.  Therefore, when  n  is large, nonsystematic variance approaches zero. \nThis is the effect of diversification. \n This property is true of portfolios other than the equally weighted one.  Any  portfolio for \nwhich each  w  \n i   becomes consistently smaller as  n  gets large (more precisely, for which each \n   wi2  approaches zero as  n  increases) will satisfy the condition that the portfolio nonsystem-\natic risk will approach zero. This property motivates us to define a    well-diversified portfolio    \nas one with each weight,  w   i  , small enough that for practical purposes the nonsystematic \nvariance,  s  2 ( e   P  ), is negligible.  \n     a.  A portfolio is invested in a very large number of shares ( n  is large). However, one-half of the portfolio \nis invested in stock 1, and the rest of the portfolio is equally divided among the other  n \u00a0 2 \u00a01 shares. Is \nthis portfolio well diversified?  \n    b.  Another portfolio also is invested in the same  n  shares, where  n  is very large. Instead of equally \nweighting with portfolio weights of 1/ n  in each stock, the weights in half the securities are 1.5/ n  \nwhile the weights in the other shares are .5/ n.  Is this portfolio well diversified?

Rewriting Equation 10.1, we conclude that, for a well-diversified portfolio, \nfor all practical purposes   \nRP5E(RP)1bPF  \n The solid line in  Figure 10.1, panel A  plots the excess return of a well-diversified port-\nfolio  A  with  E ( R   A  )\u00a0 5 \u00a010% and  b   A  \u00a0 5 \u00a01 for various realizations of the systematic factor. The \nexpected return of portfolio  A  is 10%; this is where the solid line crosses the vertical axis. \nAt this point the systematic factor is zero, implying no macro surprises. If the macro factor \nis positive, the portfolio\u2019s return exceeds its expected value; if it is negative, the portfolio\u2019s \nreturn falls short of its mean. The excess return on the portfolio is therefore   \nE(RA)1bAF510%11.03F \nCompare  panel A in Figure 10.1 with panel B,  which is a similar graph for a single stock\u00a0( S ) \nwith  b   s  \u00a0 5 \u00a01. The undiversified stock is subject to nonsystematic risk, which is seen in \na scatter of points around the line. The well-diversified portfolio\u2019s return, in contrast, is \ndetermined completely by the systematic factor.  \n In a single-factor world, all pairs of well-diversified portfolios are perfectly correlated: \nTheir risk is fully determined by the same systematic factor.

We will see later \nthat this common line is the CML.  \n  Diversification and Residual Risk in Practice \n What is the effect of diversification on portfolio residual SD  in practice,   where portfo-\nlio size is not unlimited? In reality, we may find (annualized) residual SDs as high as \n50% for large stocks and even 100% for small stocks. To illustrate the impact of diversi-\nfication, we examine portfolios of two configurations. One portfolio is equally weighted; \nthis achieves the highest benefits of diversification with equal-SD stocks. For compari-\nson, we form the other portfolio using far-from-equal weights. We select stocks in groups \nof four, with relative weights in each group of 70%, 15%, 10%, and 5%. The highest \nweight is 14 times greater than the lowest, which will severely reduce potential benefits of \ndiversification. However, extended diversification in which we add to the portfolio more \nand more groups of four stocks with the same relative weights will overcome this prob-\nlem because the highest portfolio weight still falls with additional diversification. In an \nequally weighted 1,000-stock portfolio, each weight is 0.1%; in the unequally weighted \nportfolio, with 1,000/4\u00a0 5 \u00a0250 groups of four stocks, the highest and lowest weights are \n70%/250\u00a0 5 \u00a00.28% and 5%/250\u00a0 5 \u00a00.02%, respectively. \n What is a large portfolio? Many widely held ETFs each include hundreds of stocks, and \nsome funds such as the Wilshire 5000 hold thousands. These portfolios are accessible to \nthe public since the annual expense ratios of investment companies that offer such funds \nare of the order of only 10 basis points. Thus a portfolio of 1,000 stocks is not unheard of, \nbut a portfolio of 10,000 stocks is. \n  Table\u00a010.1  shows portfolio residual SD as a function of the number of stocks. Equally \nweighted, 1,000-stock portfolios achieve small but not negligible standard deviations of \n1.58% when residual risk is 50% and 3.16% when residual risk is 100%. The SDs for the \nunbalanced portfolios are about double these values. For 10,000-stock portfolios, the SDs \nare negligible, verifying that diversification can eliminate risk even in very unbalanced \nportfolios, at least in principle, if the investment universe is large enough.   \nbod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   331bod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   331 6/21/13   3:43 PM6/21/13   3:43 PMFinal PDF to printer\n332 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n  Executing Arbitrage \n Imagine a single-factor market where the well-diversified portfolio,  M,  represents \nthe market factor,  F,  of Equation 10.1. The excess return on any security is given by \n R   i  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 a   i  \u00a0 1 \u00a0 b   i   R   M  \u00a0 1 \u00a0 e   i  , and that of a well-diversified (therefore zero residual) portfolio,  P,  is   \n RP5aP1bPRM  (10.4)     \n E(RP)5aP1bPE(RM)  (10.5)   \n Now suppose that security analysis reveals that portfolio  P  has a positive alpha.  2   We also \nestimate the risk premium of the index portfolio,  M,  from macro analysis.    \n Since neither  M  nor portfolio  P  have residual risk, the only risk to the returns of the two \nportfolios is systematic, derived from their betas on the common factor (the beta of the \nindex is 1.0). Therefore, you can eliminate the risk of  P  altogether: Construct a zero-beta \nportfolio, called  Z,  from  P  and  M  by appropriately selecting weights  w   P   and  w   M  \u00a0 5 \u00a01\u00a0 2 \u00a0 w   P   \non each portfolio:   \n bZ5wPbP1(12wP)bM50\n bM51\n  wP51\n12bP;\u00a0wM512wP52bP\n12bP  (10.6)   \nTherefore, portfolio  Z  is riskless, and its alpha is   \n aZ5wPaP1(12wP)aM5wPaP  (10.7)   \n The risk premium on  Z  must be zero because the risk of  Z  is zero. If its risk premium \nwere not zero, you could earn arbitrage profits. Here is how: \n Since the beta of  Z  is zero, Equation 10.5 implies that its risk premium is just its alpha. \nUsing Equation 10.7, its alpha is  w   P   a   P  , so   \n E(RZ)5wPaP51\n12bP aP  (10.8)   \n You now form a zero-net-investment arbitrage portfolio: If  b   P  \u00a0,\u00a01 and the risk premium \nof  Z  is positive (implying that  Z  returns more than the risk-free rate), borrow and invest \nthe proceeds in  Z . For every borrowed dollar invested in  Z,  you get a net return (i.e., net of \npaying the interest on your loan) of    1\n12bP aP.  This is a money machine, which you would \nwork as hard as you can.  3   Similarly if  b   P  \u00a0.\u00a01, Equation 10.8 tells us that the risk pre-\nmium is negative; therefore, sell  Z  short and invest the proceeds at the risk-free rate. Once \nagain, a money machine has been created. Neither situation can persist, as the large volume \nof trades from arbitrageurs pursuing these strategies will push prices until the arbitrage opportunity disappears (i.e., until the risk premium of portfolio Z equals zero).   \n  2 If the portfolio alpha is negative, we can still pursue the following strategy. We would simply switch to a short \nposition in  P,  which would have a positive alpha of the same absolute value as  P \u2019s, and a beta that is the negative \nof  P \u2019s. \n  3 The function in Equation 10.8 becomes unstable at  b   P  \u00a0 5 \u00a01. For values of  b   P   near 1, it becomes infinitely large \nwith the sign of  a   P  . This isn\u2019t an economic absurdity, since in that case, the sizes of your long position in  P  and \nshort position in  M  will be almost identical, and the arbitrage profit you earn  per dollar invested  will be nearly \ninfinite. \nbod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   332bod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   332 6/21/13   3:43 PM6/21/13   3:43 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 10 Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Multifactor Models of Risk and Return 333\n Figure 10.2 Returns as a function of the systematic factor: an arbitrage \nopportunity  \n0F (Realization of\n    Macro Factor)A\nB\n10\n8Return (%)  The No-Arbitrage Equation of the APT \n We\u2019ve seen that arbitrage activity will quickly pin the risk premium of any zero-beta well-\ndiversified portfolio to zero.  4   Setting the expression in Equation 10.8 to zero implies that \nthe alpha of  any  well-diversified portfolio must also be zero. From Equation 10.5, this \nmeans that for any well-diversified  P,       \nE(RP)5bPE(RM)  (10.9)   \n In other words, the risk premium (expected excess return) on portfolio  P  is the product of \nits beta and the market-index risk premium. Equation 10.9 thus establishes that the SML \nof the CAPM applies to well-diversified portfolios simply by virtue of the \u201cno-arbitrage\u201d \nrequirement of the APT. \n Another demonstration that the APT results in the same SML as the CAPM is more \ngraphical in nature. First we show why all well-diversified portfolios with the same beta must \nhave the same expected return.  Figure\u00a010.2  plots the returns on two such portfolios,  A  and \nB,  both with betas of 1, but with differing expected returns:  E ( r   A  )\u00a0 5 \u00a010% and  E ( r   B  )\u00a0 5 \u00a08%.   \n Could portfolios  A  and  B  coexist with the return pattern depicted?

Suppose a security analyst identifies a positive-alpha portfolio with some remaining \nresidual risk. Don\u2019t we already have a prescription for this case from the Treynor-\nBlack (T-B) procedure applied to the index model (Chapter 8)? Is this framework preferred to the APT?     \n   The APT and the CAPM \n The APT is built on the foundation of well-diversified portfolios. However, we\u2019ve seen, for example in  Table\u00a010.1 , that even large portfolios may have non-negligible residual risk. Some indexed portfolios may have hundreds or thousands of stocks, but active portfolios generally cannot, as there is a limit to how many stocks can be actively analyzed in search of alpha. How does the APT stand up to these limitations? \n Suppose we order all portfolios in the universe by residual risk. Think of Level 0 portfo-\nlios as having zero residual risk; in other words, they are the theoretically well-diversified portfolios of the APT. Level 1 portfolios have very small residual risk, say up to 0.5%. Level 2 portfolios have yet greater residual SD, say up to 1%, and so on. \n If the SML described by Equation 10.9 applies to all well-diversified Level 0 portfolios, \nit must at least approximate the risk premiums of Level 1 portfolios. Even more important, while Level 1 risk premiums may deviate slightly from Equation 10.9, such deviations should be unbiased, with alphas equally likely to be positive or negative. Deviations should be uncorrelated with beta or residual SD and should average to zero. \n We can apply the same logic to portfolios of slightly higher Level 2 residual risk. Since \nall Level 1 portfolios are still well approximated by Equation 10.9, so must be risk pre-miums of Level 2 portfolios, albeit with slightly less accuracy. Here too, we may take comfort in the lack of bias and zero average deviations from the risk premiums pre-dicted by Equation 10.9. But still, the precision of predictions of risk premiums from Equation 10.9 consistently deteriorates with increasing residual risk. (One might ask why we don\u2019t transform Level 2 portfolios into Level 1 or even Level 0 portfolios by further diversifying, but as we\u2019ve pointed out, this may not be feasible in practice for assets with considerable residual risk when active portfolio size or the size of the investment universe is limited.) If residual risk is sufficiently high and the impediments to complete diversifica-tion are too onerous, we cannot have full confidence in the APT and the arbitrage activities that underpin it. \n Despite this shortcoming, the APT is valuable. First, recall that the CAPM requires that \nalmost all investors be mean-variance optimizers. We may well suspect that they are not. The APT frees us of this assumption. It is sufficient that a small number of sophisticated arbitrageurs scour the market for arbitrage opportunities. This alone produces an SML, Equation 10.9, that is a good and unbiased approximation for all assets but those with significant residual risk. \n Perhaps even more important is the fact that the APT is anchored by observable port-\nfolios such as the market index. The CAPM is not even testable because it relies on an unobserved, all-inclusive portfolio. The reason that the APT is not fully superior to the CAPM is that at the level of individual assets and high residual risk, pure arbitrage may be insufficient to enforce Equation 10.9. Therefore, we need to turn to the CAPM as a complementary theoretical construct behind equilibrium risk premiums. \n It should be noted, however, that when we replace the unobserved market portfolio of \nthe CAPM with an observed, broad index portfolio that may not be efficient, we no longer can be sure that the CAPM predicts risk premiums of all assets with no bias. Neither model therefore is free of limitations. Comparing the APT arbitrage strategy to maximization of the Sharpe ratio in the context of an index model may well be the more useful framework for analysis.  \nbod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   335bod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   335 6/21/13   3:43 PM6/21/13   3:43 PMFinal PDF to printer\n336 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n  The APT and Portfolio Optimization in a Single-Index Market \n The APT is couched in a single-factor market  5   and applies with perfect accuracy to  well-\ndiversified  portfolios. It shows arbitrageurs how to generate infinite profits if the risk pre-\nmium of a well-diversified portfolio deviates from Equation 10.9. The trades executed by these arbitrageurs are the enforcers of the accuracy of this equation.\n  \n In effect, the APT shows how to take advantage of security mispricing when diversifica-\ntion opportunities are abundant. When you lock in and scale up an arbitrage opportunity you\u2019re sure to be rich as Croesus regardless of the composition of the rest of your portfolio, but only if the arbitrage portfolio is truly risk-free! However, if the arbitrage position is not perfectly well diversified, an increase in its scale (borrowing cash, or borrowing shares to go short) will increase the risk of the arbitrage position, potentially without bound. The APT ignores this complication. \n Now consider an investor who confronts the same single factor market, and whose \nsecurity analysis reveals an underpriced asset (or portfolio), that is, one whose risk  premium implies a positive alpha. This investor can follow the advice weaved throughout Chapters 6\u20138 to construct an optimal risky portfolio. The optimization process will  consider both the potential profit from a position in the mispriced asset, as well as the risk of the overall portfolio and efficient diversification. As we saw in Chapter 8, the Treynor-Black (T-B) procedure can be summarized as follows.  \n6    \n    1. Estimate the risk premium and standard deviation of the benchmark (index) portfo-\nlio,  RP   M   and  s   M  .  \n   2. Place all the assets that are mispriced into an active portfolio. Call the alpha of the \nactive portfolio  a   A  , its systematic-risk coefficient  b   A  , and its residual risk  s ( e   A  ). \nYour optimal risky portfolio will allocate to the active portfolio a weight,    wA* :   \nwA*wA0\n11wA0(12b A)we\nERAA\nA\nM\nM02()\n();\n2 \n  The allocation to the passive portfolio is then,    wM*512wA*.  With this alloca-\ntion, the increase in the Sharpe ratio of the optimal portfolio,  S   P  , over that of the \npassive portfolio,  S   M  , depends on the size of the information ratio of the active \nportfolio,  IR A \u00a0 5 \u00a0 a   A  / s ( e   A  ). The optimized portfolio can attain a Sharpe ratio of \n   SP5\"SM21IRA2.   \n   3. To maximize the Sharpe ratio of the risky portfolio, you maximize the IR of the \nactive portfolio. This is achieved by allocating to each asset in the active portfolio \na portfolio weight proportional to:  w   Ai  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 a   i  / s  2 ( e   i  ). When this is done, the square \nof the information ratio of the active portfolio will be the sum of the squared indi-\nvidual information ratios:    IRA25aIRi2.      \n Now see what happens in the T-B model when the residual risk of the active portfolio \nis zero. This is essentially the assumption of the APT, that a well-diversified portfolio \n(with zero residual risk) can be formed. When the residual risk of the active portfolio goes to zero, the position in it goes to infinity. This is precisely the same implication as the APT: When portfolios are well-diversified, you will scale up an arbitrage position without \n  5 The APT is easily extended to a multifactor market as we show later. \n  6 The tediousness of some of the expressions involved in the T-B method should not deter anyone. The calcula-\ntions are pretty straightforward, especially in a spreadsheet. The estimation of the risk parameters also is a rela-\ntively straightforward statistical task. The real difficulty is to uncover security alphas and the macro-factor risk premium,  RP  \n M  . \nbod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   336bod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   336 6/21/13   3:43 PM6/21/13   3:43 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 10 Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Multifactor Models of Risk and Return 337\n  Table\u00a010.2  summarizes a rudimentary experiment that compares the prescriptions and \npredictions of the APT and T-B model in the presence of realistic values of residual risk. \nWe use relatively small alpha values (1 and 3%), three levels of residual risk consistent \nwith values in  Table\u00a010.1  (2, 3, and 4%), and two levels of beta (0.5 and 2) to span the \nlikely range of reasonable parameters.  \n The first set of columns in  Table\u00a010.2 , titled Active Portfolio, show the parameter \n values in each example. The second set of columns, titled Zero-Net-Investment, Arbi trage \n(Zero-Beta), shows the weight in the active portfolio and resultant information ratio of \nthe active portfolio. This would be the Sharpe ratio if the arbitrage position (the positive-\nalpha, zero-beta portfolio) made up the entire risky portfolio (as would be prescribed  Example 10.3 Exploiting Alpha bound. Similarly, when the residual risk of an asset in the active T-B portfolio is zero, it \nwill displace all other assets from that portfolio, and thus the residual risk of the active \nportfolio will be zero and elicit the same extreme portfolio response. \n When residual risks are nonzero, the T-B procedure produces the optimal risky port-\nfolio, which is a compromise between seeking alpha and shunning potentially diversifi-\nable risk. The APT ignores residual risk altogether, assuming it has been diversified away. \nObviously, we have no use for the APT in this context. When residual risk can be made \nsmall through diversification, the T-B model prescribes very aggressive (large) positions \nin mispriced securities that exert great pressure on equilibrium risk premiums to eliminate \nnonzero alpha values. The T-B model does what the APT is meant to do but with more \nflexibility in terms of accommodating the practical limits to diversification.

This simpli-\nfying assumption is in fact too simplistic. We\u2019ve noted that it is easy to think of several factors driven by the business cycle that might affect stock returns: interest rate fluctua-tions, inflation rates, and so on. Presumably, exposure to any of these factors will affect a stock\u2019s risk and hence its expected return. We can derive a multifactor version of the APT to accommodate these multiple sources of risk. \n Suppose that we generalize the single-factor model expressed in Equation 10.1 to a \ntwo-factor model:   \n R\ni5E(Ri)1bi1F11bi2F21ei  (10.10)  \nIn Example 10.2, factor 1 was the departure of GDP growth from expectations, and factor 2 \nwas the unanticipated change in interest rates. Each factor has zero expected value because each measures the  surprise  in the systematic variable rather than the level of the variable. \nSimilarly, the firm-specific component of unexpected return,  e  \n i  , also has zero expected \nvalue. Extending such a two-factor model to any number of factors is straightforward. \n We can now generalize the simple APT to a more general multifactor version. But first \nwe must introduce the concept of a    factor portfolio,    which is a well-diversified portfolio \nconstructed to have a beta of 1 on one of the factors and a beta of zero on any other factor. \nWe can think of a factor portfolio as a  tracking portfolio.  That is, the returns on such a port-\nfolio track the evolution of particular sources of macroeconomic risk but are uncorrelated with other sources of risk. It is possible to form such factor portfolios because we have a large number of securities to choose from, and a relatively small number of factors. Factor portfolios will serve as the benchmark portfolios for a multifactor security market line.  The multidimensional SML predicts that exposure to each risk factor contributes to the  security\u2019s total risk premium by an amount equal to the factor beta times the risk premium of the factor portfolio tracking that source of risk. We illustrate with an example.by the APT). The last set of columns shows the T-B position in the active portfolio that \nmaximizes the Sharpe ratio of the overall risky portfolio. The final column shows the increment to the Sharpe ratio of the T-B portfolio relative to the APT portfolio. \n Keep in mind that even when the two models call for a similar weight in the active \nportfolio (compare w in Active for the APT model to w(beta) for the T-B model), they \nnevertheless prescribe a different overall risky portfolio. The APT assumes zero invest-ment beyond what is necessary to hedge out the market risk of the active portfolio. In contrast, the T-B procedure chooses a mix of active and index portfolios to maximize the Sharpe ratio. With identical investment in the active portfolio, the T-B portfolio can still include additional investment in the index portfolio. \n To obtain the Sharpe ratio of the risky portfolio, we need the Sharpe ratio of the \nindex portfolio. As an estimate, we use the average return and standard deviation of \nthe broad market index (NYSE\u00a0 1 \u00a0AMEX\u00a0 1 \u00a0NASDAQ) over the period 1926\u20132012. The \ntop row (over the column titles) of  Table\u00a010.2  shows an annual Sharpe ratio of 0.35. The \nrows of the table are ordered by the information ratio of the active portfolio. \n  Table\u00a010.2  shows that the T-B procedure noticeably improves the Sharpe ratio beyond \nthe information ratio of the APT (for which the IR is also the Sharpe ratio). However, as the information ratio of the active portfolio increases, the difference in the T-B and APT active portfolio positions declines, as does the difference between their Sharpe ratios. Put differently, the higher the information ratio, the closer we are to a risk-free arbitrage opportunity, and the closer are the prescriptions of the APT and T-B models. \nbod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   338bod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   338 6/21/13   3:43 PM6/21/13   3:43 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 10 Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Multifactor Models of Risk and Return 339\n  To generalize the argument in Example 10.4, note that the factor exposures of any port-\nfolio,  P,  are given by its betas,  b   P 1  and  b   P 2 . A competing portfolio,  Q,  can be formed by \ninvesting in factor portfolios with the following weights:  b   P 1  in the first factor portfolio, \n b   P 2  in the second factor portfolio, and 1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 b   P 1 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 b   P 2  in T-bills. By construction, portfolio \n Q  will have betas equal to those of portfolio  P  and expected return of   \n E(rQ)5bP1E(r1)1bP2E(r2)1(12bP12bP2)rf\n  5rf1bP13E(r1)2rf41bP23E(r2)2rf4  (10.11)   \n Using the numbers in Example 10.4:   \nE(rQ)541.53(1024)1.753(1224)513%   Suppose that the two factor portfolios, portfolios 1 and 2, have expected returns \n E ( r  1 )\u00a0 5 \u00a010% and  E ( r  2 )\u00a0 5 \u00a012%. Suppose further that the risk-free rate is 4%. The risk \npremium on the first factor portfolio is 10%\u00a0 2 \u00a04%\u00a0 5 \u00a06%, whereas that on the second \nfactor portfolio is 12%\u00a0 2 \u00a04%\u00a0 5 \u00a08%. \n Now consider a well-diversified portfolio, portfolio  A,  with beta on the first factor, \n b   A 1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.5, and beta on the second factor,  b   A 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.75. The multifactor APT states that the \noverall risk premium on this portfolio must equal the sum of the risk premiums required \nas compensation for each source of systematic risk. The risk premium attributable to risk factor 1 should be the portfolio\u2019s exposure to factor 1,  b  \n A 1 , multiplied by the risk pre-\nmium earned on the first factor portfolio,  E ( r  1 )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  . Therefore, the portion of portfolio \n A \u2019s risk premium that is compensation for its exposure to the first factor is  b   A 1 [ E ( r  1 )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  ]\u00a0 5 \u00a0\n.5(10%\u00a0  2 \u00a0 4%)\u00a0  5 \u00a0 3%, whereas the risk premium attributable to risk factor 2 is \n b   A 2 [ E ( r  2 )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  ]\u00a0 5 \u00a0.75(12%\u00a0 2 \u00a04%)\u00a0 5 \u00a06%. The total risk premium on the portfolio should \nbe 3%\u00a0 1 \u00a06%\u00a0 5 \u00a09% and the total return on the portfolio should be 4%\u00a0 1 \u00a09%\u00a0 5 \u00a013%.  Example 10.4 Multifactor SML \n Suppose that the expected return on portfolio  A  from Example 10.4 were 12% rather \nthan 13%. This return would give rise to an arbitrage opportunity. Form a portfolio from \nthe factor portfolios with the same betas as portfolio  A.  This requires weights of .5 on \nthe first factor portfolio, .75 on the second factor portfolio, and  2 .25 on the risk-free \nasset. This portfolio has exactly the same factor betas as portfolio  A:  It has a beta of .5 on \nthe first factor because of its .5 weight on the first factor portfolio, and a beta of .75 on the second factor. (The weight of  2 .25 on risk-free T-bills does not affect the sensitiv-\nity to either factor.) \n Now invest $1 in portfolio  Q  and sell (short) $1 in portfolio  A.  Your net investment is \nzero, but your expected dollar profit is positive and equal to   \n$1\u00a03 E(r\nQ)\u00a02\u00a0$1\u00a03\u00a0E (rA)\u00a05\u00a0$1\u00a03\u00a0.13\u00a02\u00a0$1\u00a03\u00a0.12\u00a05\u00a0$.01\n Moreover, your net position is riskless. Your exposure to each risk factor cancels out \nbecause you are long $1 in portfolio  Q  and short $1 in portfolio  A,  and both of these \nwell-diversified portfolios have exactly the same factor betas. Thus, if portfolio  A \u2019s \nexpected return differs from that of portfolio  Q \u2019s, you can earn positive risk-free profits \non a zero-net-investment position. This is an arbitrage opportunity.

So portfolio  A  also ought \nto have an expected return of 13%. If it does not, then there will be an arbitrage opportunity.  7    \n We conclude that any well-diversified portfolio with betas  b   P 1  and  b   P 2  must \nhave the return given in Equation 10.11 if arbitrage opportunities are to be precluded. \nEquation 10.11 simply generalizes the one-factor SML. \n Finally, the extension of the multifactor SML of Equation 10.11 to individual assets \nis precisely the same as for the one-factor APT. Equation 10.11 cannot be satisfied by every well-diversified portfolio unless it is satisfied approximately by individual securities. Equation 10.11 thus represents the multifactor SML for an economy with multiple sources of risk. \n We pointed out earlier that one application of the CAPM is to provide \u201cfair\u201d rates \nof return for regulated utilities. The multifactor APT can be used to the same ends. The \nnearby box summarizes a study in which the APT was applied to find the cost of capital for regulated electric companies. Notice that empirical estimates for interest rate and infla-tion risk premiums in the box are negative, as we argued was reasonable in our discussion of Example 10.2. \n     Using the factor portfolios of Example 10.4, find the equilib-\nrium rate of return on a portfolio with  b  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.2 and  b  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a01.4.  CONCEPT CHECK 10.3 \n  7 The risk premium on portfolio  A  is 9% (more than the historical risk premium of the S&P 500) despite the fact \nthat its betas, which are both below 1, might  seem  defensive. This highlights another distinction between multi-\nfactor and single-factor models. Whereas a beta greater than 1 in a single-factor market is aggressive, we cannot \nsay in advance what would be aggressive or defensive in a multifactor economy where risk premiums depend on the sum of the contributions of several factors. \n  \n8 Eugene F.

One example of this approach is the Fama and French three-factor model and its variants, which have come to dominate empirical research and industry applications:  \n8       \n Rit5ai1biMRMt1biSMBSMB t1biHMLHML t1eit  (10.12)  \nwhere\n   SMB  5   Small Minus Big, i.e., the return of a portfolio of small stocks in excess of the \nreturn on a portfolio of large stocks.  \n  HML  5   High Minus Low, i.e., the return of a portfolio of stocks with a high \nbook-to-market ratio in excess of the return on a portfolio of stocks with a low book-to-market ratio.    \n Note that in this model the market index does play a role and is expected to capture sys-tematic risk originating from macroeconomic factors. \n These two firm-characteristic variables are chosen because of long-standing observa-\ntions that corporate capitalization (firm size) and book-to-market ratio predict deviations \nbod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   340bod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   340 6/21/13   3:43 PM6/21/13   3:43 PMFinal PDF to printer\n341  Using the APT to Find Cost of Capital \n Elton, Gruber, and Mei *  use the APT to derive the cost of \ncapital for electric utilities. They assume that the relevant \nrisk factors are unanticipated developments in the term structure of interest rates, the level of interest rates, infla-tion rates, the business cycle (measured by GDP), foreign exchange rates, and a summary measure they devise to measure other macro factors.\n  Their first step is to estimate the risk premium associ-\nated with exposure to each risk source. They accomplish \nthis in a two-step strategy (which we will describe in con-siderable detail in Chapter 13):\n    1.   Estimate \u201cfactor loadings\u201d (i.e., betas) of a large sample \nof firms.  Regress returns of 100 randomly selected stocks against the systematic risk factors. They use a time-series regression for each stock (e.g., 60 months of data), therefore estimating 100 regressions, one for each stock.  \n   2.   Estimate the reward earned per unit of exposure to \neach risk factor.  For each month, regress the return \nof each stock against the five betas estimated. The coefficient on each beta is the extra average return earned as beta increases, i.e., it is an estimate of the risk premium for that risk factor from that month\u2019s data. These estimates are of course subject to sam-pling error. Therefore, average the risk premium esti-mates across the 12 months in each year. The  average   \nresponse of return to risk is less subject to sampling error.   \nThe risk premiums are in the middle column of the table at the top of the next column. \n Notice that some risk premiums are negative. The \ninterpretation of this result is that risk premium should be \npositive for risk factors you don\u2019t want exposure to, but  negative  for factors you  do  want exposure to. For example, \nyou should desire securities that have higher returns when \ninflation increases and be willing to accept lower expected returns on such securities; this shows up as a negative risk premium.

WORDS FROM THE STREET \nof average stock returns from levels consistent with the CAPM. Fama and French jus-\ntify this model on empirical grounds: While SMB and HML are not themselves obvious candidates for relevant risk factors, the argument is that these variables may proxy for yet-unknown more-fundamental variables. For example, Fama and French point out that firms with high ratios of book-to-market value are more likely to be in financial distress and that small stocks may be more sensitive to changes in business conditions. Thus, these variables may capture sensitivity to risk factors in the macroeconomy. More evidence on the Fama-French model appears in Chapter 13. \n The problem with empirical approaches such as the Fama-French model, which use prox-\nies for extramarket sources of risk, is that none of the factors in the proposed models can be clearly identified as hedging a significant source of uncertainty. Black  \n9   points out that \n  9 Fischer Black, \u201cBeta and Return,\u201d  Journal of Portfolio Management  20 (1993), pp. 8\u201318. \nbod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   341bod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   341 6/21/13   3:43 PM6/21/13   3:43 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm342 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nwhen researchers scan and rescan the database of security returns in search of explanatory \nfactors (an activity often called data-snooping), they may eventually uncover past \u201cpatterns\u201d that are due purely to chance. Black observes that return premiums to factors such as firm size have proven to be inconsistent since first discovered. However, Fama and French have shown that size and book-to-market ratios have predicted average returns in various time periods and in markets all over the world, thus mitigating potential effects of data-snooping.\n  \n The firm-characteristic basis of the Fama-French factors raises the question of whether \nthey reflect a multi-index ICAPM based on extra-market hedging demands or just repre-sent yet-unexplained anomalies, where firm characteristics are correlated with alpha val-ues. This is an important distinction for the debate over the proper interpretation of the model, because the validity of FF-style models may signify either a deviation from rational equilibrium (as there is no rational reason to prefer one or another of these firm character-istics per se), or that firm characteristics identified as empirically associated with average returns are correlated with other (yet unknown) risk factors. \n The issue is still unresolved and is discussed in Chapter 13.    \n     1 .   Multifactor models seek to improve the explanatory power of single-factor models by explicitly \naccounting for the various systematic components of security risk. These models use indicators intended to capture a wide range of macroeconomic risk factors.  \n    2 .   Once we allow for multiple risk factors, we conclude that the security market line also ought to be multidimensional, with exposure to each risk factor contributing to the total risk premium of the security.  \n    3 .   A (risk-free) arbitrage opportunity arises when two or more security prices enable investors to construct a zero-net-investment portfolio that will yield a sure profit. The presence of arbitrage opportunities will generate a large volume of trades that puts pressure on security prices. This pressure will continue until prices reach levels that preclude such arbitrage.  \n    4 .   When securities are priced so that there are no risk-free arbitrage opportunities, we say that they satisfy the no-arbitrage condition. Price relationships that satisfy the no-arbitrage condition are important because we expect them to hold in real-world markets.  \n    5 .   Portfolios are called \u201cwell-diversified\u201d if they include a large number of securities and the invest-ment proportion in each is sufficiently small. The proportion of a security in a well-diversified portfolio is small enough so that for all practical purposes a reasonable change in that security\u2019s rate of return will have a negligible effect on the portfolio\u2019s rate of return.  \n    6 .   In a single-factor security market, all well-diversified portfolios have to satisfy the expected return\u2013beta relationship of the CAPM to satisfy the no-arbitrage condition. If all well-diversified portfolios satisfy the expected return\u2013beta relationship, then individual securities also must sat-isfy this relationship, at least approximately.  \n    7 .   The APT does not require the restrictive assumptions of the CAPM and its (unobservable) market portfolio. The price of this generality is that the APT does not guarantee this relationship for all securities at all times.  \n    8 .   A multifactor APT generalizes the single-factor model to accommodate several sources of sys-tematic risk. The multidimensional security market line predicts that exposure to each risk factor contributes to the security\u2019s total risk premium by an amount equal to the factor beta times the risk premium of the factor portfolio that tracks that source of risk.  \n    9 .   A multifactor extension of the single-factor CAPM, the ICAPM, is a model of the risk\u2013return trade-off that predicts the same multidimensional security market line as the APT. The ICAPM suggests that priced risk factors will be those sources of risk that lead to significant hedging demand by a substantial fraction of investors.

Suppose that two factors have been identified for the U.S. economy: the growth rate of industrial \nproduction, IP, and the inflation rate, IR. IP is expected to be 3%, and IR 5%. A stock with a \nbeta of 1 on IP and .5 on IR currently is expected to provide a rate of return of 12%. If industrial production actually grows by 5%, while the inflation rate turns out to be 8%, what is your revised estimate of the expected rate of return on the stock?    \n    2.  T he APT itself does not provide guidance concerning the factors that one might expect to deter-\nmine risk premiums. How should researchers decide which factors to investigate? Why, for exam ple, \nis industrial production a reasonable factor to test for a risk premium?  \n   3. If the APT is to be a useful theory, the number of systematic factors in the economy must be \nsmall. Why?     \n    4.  S uppose that there are two independent economic factors,  F  \n1  and  F  2 . The risk-free rate is 6%, \nand all stocks have independent firm-specific components with a standard deviation of 45%.

Assume that stock market returns have the market index as a common factor, and that all stocks \nin the economy have a beta of 1 on the market index.

The risk-free rate \nis 2%.

As a finance intern at Pork Products, Jennifer Wainwright\u2019s assignment is to come up with fresh \ninsights concerning the firm\u2019s cost of capital. She decides that this would be a good opportunity \nto try out the new material on the APT that she learned last semester. She decides that three promising factors would be (i) the return on a broad-based index such as the S&P 500; (ii) the level of interest rates, as represented by the yield to maturity on 10-year Treasury bonds; and (iii) the price of hogs, which are particularly important to her firm. Her plan is to find the beta of Pork Products against each of these factors by using a multiple regression and to estimate the risk premium associated with each exposure factor. Comment on Jennifer\u2019s choice of factors. Which are most promising with respect to the likely impact on her firm\u2019s cost of capital? Can you suggest improvements to her specification?   \n  Use the following information to Answer   Problems 13\u201316:   Orb Trust (Orb) has historically leaned toward a passive management style of its portfolios. The only model that Orb\u2019s senior management has promoted in the past is the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Now Orb\u2019s management has asked one of its analysts, Kevin McCracken, CFA, to investi-gate the use of the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) model. \n McCracken believes that a two-factor APT model is adequate, where the factors are the sensitiv-\nity to changes in real GDP and changes in inflation. McCracken has concluded that the factor risk premium for real GDP is 8% while the factor risk premium for inflation is 2%. He estimates for Orb\u2019s High Growth Fund that the sensitivities to these two factors are 1.25 and 1.5, respectively. \nbod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   345bod61671_ch10_324-348.indd   345 6/21/13   3:43 PM6/21/13   3:43 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm346 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nUsing his APT results, he computes the expected return of the fund. For comparison purposes, he \nthen uses fundamental analysis to also compute the expected return of Orb\u2019s High Growth Fund. \nMcCracken finds that the two estimates of the Orb High Growth Fund\u2019s expected return are equal. \n McCracken asks a fellow analyst, Sue Kwon, to provide an estimate of the expected return of \nOrb\u2019s Large Cap Fund based on fundamental analysis. Kwon, who manages the fund, says that the \nexpected return is 8.5% above the risk-free rate. McCracken then applies the APT model to the Large \nCap Fund. He finds that the sensitivities to real GDP and inflation are .75 and 1.25, respectively. \n McCracken\u2019s manager at Orb, Jay Stiles, asks McCracken to compose a portfolio that has a unit \nsensitivity to real GDP growth but is not affected by inflation. McCracken is confident in his APT \nestimates for the High Growth Fund and the Large Cap Fund. He then computes the sensitivities for \na third fund, Orb\u2019s Utility Fund, which has sensitivities equal to 1.0 and 2.0, respectively. McCracken \nwill use his APT results for these three funds to accomplish the task of creating a portfolio with a \nunit exposure to real GDP and no exposure to inflation. He calls the fund the \u201cGDP Fund.\u201d Stiles \nsays such a GDP Fund would be good for clients who are retirees who live off the steady income of \ntheir investments. McCracken says that the fund would be a good choice if upcoming supply side \nmacroeconomic policies of the government are successful. \n    13. According to the APT, if the risk-free rate is 4%, what should be McCracken\u2019s estimate of the \nexpected return of Orb\u2019s High Growth Fund?  \n   14. With respect to McCracken\u2019s APT model estimate of Orb\u2019s Large Cap Fund and the information \nKwon provides, is an arbitrage opportunity available?  \n   15. The GDP Fund composed from the other three funds would have a weight in Utility Fund  equal   \nto ( a )  2 2.2; ( b )  2 3.2; or ( c ) .3.  \n   16.

Business cycle theo-rists felt that tracing the evolution of several economic variables over time would clarify and predict the progress of the economy through boom and bust periods. A natural candidate for analysis was the behavior of stock market prices over time. Assuming that stock prices reflect the prospects of the firm, recurrent patterns of peaks and troughs in economic performance ought to show up in those prices. \n Maurice Kendall examined this proposi-\ntion in 1953.  \n1   He found to his great surprise \nthat he could identify no predictable pat-\nterns in stock prices. Prices seemed to evolve randomly. They were as likely to go up as they were to go down on any particular day, regardless of past performance. The data pro-vided no way to predict price movements.\n   At first blush, Kendall\u2019s results were dis-\nturbing to some financial economists. They \nseemed to imply that the stock market is dominated by erratic market psychology, or \u201canimal spirits\u201d\u2014that it follows no logical rules. In short, the results appeared to con-firm the irrationality of the market. On fur-ther reflection, however, economists came to reverse their interpretation of Kendall\u2019s study. \n It soon became apparent that random \nprice movements indicated a well-functioning \nor efficient market, not an irrational one. In this chapter we explore the reasoning behind what may seem a surprising conclu-sion. We show how competition among ana-lysts leads naturally to market efficiency, and we examine the implications of the efficient market hypothesis for investment policy. We also consider empirical evidence that sup-ports and contradicts the notion of market efficiency.

What a gold mine \nthis would have been. If they could use Kendall\u2019s equations to predict stock prices, inves-tors would reap unending profits simply by purchasing stocks that the computer model implied were about to increase in price and by selling those stocks about to fall in price. \n A moment\u2019s reflection should be enough to convince yourself that this situation could \nnot persist for long. For example, suppose that the model predicts with great confidence that XYZ stock price, currently at $100 per share, will rise dramatically in 3 days to $110. What would all investors with access to the model\u2019s prediction do today? Obviously, they would place a great wave of immediate buy orders to cash in on the prospective increase in stock price. No one holding XYZ, however, would be willing to sell. The net effect would be an  immediate  jump in the stock price to $110. The forecast of a future price increase \nwill lead instead to an immediate price increase. In other words, the stock price will imme-diately reflect the \u201cgood news\u201d implicit in the model\u2019s forecast. \n This simple example illustrates why Kendall\u2019s attempt to find recurrent patterns in \nstock price movements was likely to fail. A forecast about favorable  future  performance \nleads instead to favorable  current  performance, as market participants all try to get in on \nthe action before the price jump. \n More generally, one might say that any information that could be used to predict stock \nperformance should already be reflected in stock prices. As soon as there is any informa-tion indicating that a stock is underpriced and therefore offers a profit opportunity, inves-tors flock to buy the stock and immediately bid up its price to a fair level, where only ordinary rates of return can be expected. These \u201cordinary rates\u201d are simply rates of return commensurate with the risk of the stock. \n However, if prices are bid immediately to fair levels, given all available information, \nit must be that they increase or decrease only in response to new information. New infor-mation, by definition, must be unpredictable; if it could be predicted, then the prediction would be part of today\u2019s information. Thus stock prices that change in response to new (that is, previously unpredicted) information also must move unpredictably. \n This is the essence of the argument that stock prices should follow a    random walk,      that \nis, that price changes should be random and unpredictable.  \n2   Far from a proof of market \nirrationality, randomly evolving stock prices would be the necessary consequence of intel-ligent investors competing to discover relevant information on which to buy or sell stocks before the rest of the market becomes aware of that information.  \n Don\u2019t confuse randomness in price  changes  with irrationality in the  level  of prices. If \nprices are determined rationally, then only new information will cause them to change. Therefore, a random walk would be the natural result of prices that always reflect all current knowledge. Indeed, if stock price movements were predictable, that would be damning evi-dence of stock market inefficiency, because the ability to predict prices would indicate that \n  2 Actually, we are being a little loose with terminology here. Strictly speaking, we should characterize stock \nprices as following a submartingale, meaning that the expected change in the price can be positive, presumably as \ncompensation for the time value of money and systematic risk. Moreover, the expected return may change over time as risk factors change. A random walk is more restrictive in that it constrains successive stock returns to be independent  and  identically distributed. Nevertheless, the term \u201crandom walk\u201d is commonly used in the looser \nsense that price changes are essentially unpredictable. We will follow this convention. \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   350bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   350 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 11 The Efficient Market Hypothesis 351\nall available information was not already \nreflected in stock prices. Therefore, the \nnotion that stocks already reflect all avail-\nable information is referred to as the \n   efficient market hypothesis    (EMH).  3    \n  Figure\u00a0 11.1  illustrates the response \nof stock prices to new information in an \nefficient market. The graph plots the price \nresponse of a sample of firms that were \ntargets of takeover attempts. In most take-\novers, the acquiring firm pays a substan-\ntial premium over current market prices. \nTherefore, announcement of a takeover \nattempt should cause the stock price to \njump. The figure shows that stock prices \njump dramatically on the day the news \nbecomes public. However, there is no \nfurther drift in prices  after   the announce-\nment date, suggesting that prices reflect \nthe new information, including the likely \nmagnitude of the takeover premium, by \nthe end of the trading day.  \n Even more dramatic evidence of \nrapid response to new information may \nbe found in intraday prices. For exam-\nple, Patell and Wolfson show that most \nof the stock price response to corporate \ndividend or earnings announcements occurs within 10 minutes of the announcement.  4   \nA nice illustration of such rapid adjustment is provided in a study by Busse and Green, \nwho track minute-by-minute stock prices of firms that are featured on CNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning\u201d \nor \u201cMidday Call\u201d segments.  5   Minute 0 in  Figure\u00a011.2  is the time at which the stock is \nmentioned on the midday show. The top line is the average price movement of stocks \nthat receive positive reports, while the bottom line reports returns on stocks with negative \nreports. Notice that the top line levels off, indicating that the market has fully digested the \nnews within 5 minutes of the report. The bottom line levels off within about 12 minutes.   \n   Competition as the Source of Efficiency \n Why should we expect stock prices to reflect \u201call available information\u201d? After all, if you \nare willing to spend time and money on gathering information, it might seem reasonable \nthat you could turn up something that has been overlooked by the rest of the investment \ncommunity. When information is costly to uncover and analyze, one would expect invest-\nment analysis calling for such expenditures to result in an increased expected return. \n3 Market efficiency should not be confused with the idea of efficient portfolios introduced in Chapter 7. An infor-\nmationally efficient  market   is one in which information is rapidly disseminated and reflected in prices. An efficient \n portfolio   is one with the highest expected return for a given level of risk. \n  4 J. M. Patell and M. A.

Therefore, the fund would be willing to spend up to $5 million per year \non research to increase stock returns by a mere tenth of 1% per year. With such large \nrewards for such small increases in investment performance, it should not be surpris-\ning that professional portfolio managers are willing to spend large sums on industry \nanalysts, computer support, and research effort, and therefore that price changes are, \ngenerally speaking, difficult to predict. \n With so many well-backed analysts willing to spend considerable resources on \nresearch, easy pickings in the market are rare.

An industry of so-called  expert network \nproviders  has emerged for selling access to experts with \nunique insights about a wide variety of firms and indus-tries to investors who need that information to make deci-sions. These firms have been dubbed matchmakers for the information age. Experts can range from doctors who help predict the release of blockbuster drugs to meteorologists who forecast weather that can affect commodity prices to business executives who can provide specialized insight about companies and industries. \n But some of those experts have peddled prohibited \ninside information. In 2011, Winifred Jiau, a consultant for \nPrimary Global Research, was convicted of selling informa-tion about Nvidia and Marvell Technologies to the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. Several other employees of Primary Global also were charged with insider trading. \n Expert firms are supposed to provide only public infor-\nmation, along with the expert\u2019s insights and perspective. \nBut the temptation to hire experts with inside informa-tion and charge handsomely for access to them is obvious. The SEC has raised concerns about the boundary between legitimate and illegal services, and several hedge funds in 2011 shut down after raids searched for evidence of such illicit activity. \n In the wake of increased scrutiny, compliance efforts \nof both buyers and sellers of expert information have \nmushroomed. The largest network firm is Gerson Lehrman Group with a stable of 300,000 experts. It now maintains records down to the minute of which of its experts talks to whom and the topics they have discussed.  \n7   These records \ncould be turned over to authorities in the event of an \ninsider trading investigation. For their part, some hedge funds have simply ceased working with expert-network firms or have promulgated clearer rules for when their employees may talk with consultants.  \n Even with these safeguards, however, there remains \nroom for trouble. For example, an investor may meet an \nexpert through a legitimate network and then the two may establish a consulting relationship on their own. This legal matchmaking becomes the precursor to the illegal selling of insider tips. Where there is a will to cheat, there usually will be a way.   WORDS FROM THE STREET \n353highly paid, aggressive analysts ensures that, as a general rule, stock prices ought to reflect \navailable information regarding their proper levels.  \n Information is often said to be the most precious commodity on Wall Street, and the \ncompetition for it is intense. Sometimes the quest for a competitive advantage can tip over into a search for illegal inside information. In 2011, Raj Rajaratnam, the head of the Galleon Group hedge fund which once managed $6.5 billion, was convicted on insider trading charges for soliciting tips from a network of corporate insiders and traders. Rajaratnam\u2019s was only one of several major insider trading cases working their way through the courts in 2011. While Galleon\u2019s practices were egregious, drawing a clear line separating legitimate and prohibited sources of information often can be difficult. For example, a large industry of  expert network  firms has emerged in the last decade to connect (for a fee) investors to \nindustry experts who can provide unique perspective on a company. As the nearby box dis-cusses, this sort of arrangement can easily cross the line into insider trading.  \n  Versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis \n It is common to distinguish among three versions of the EMH: the weak, semistrong, and strong forms of the hypothesis. These versions differ by their notions of what is meant by the term \u201call available information.\u201d \n The    weak-form    hypothesis asserts that stock prices already reflect all information that \ncan be derived by examining market trading data such as the history of past prices, trad-ing volume, or short interest. This version of the hypothesis implies that trend analysis is fruitless. Past stock price data are publicly available and virtually costless to obtain. The weak-form hypothesis holds that if such data ever conveyed reliable signals about future performance, all investors already would have learned to exploit the signals. Ultimately, \n  7 \u201cExpert Networks Are the Matchmakers for the Information Age,\u201d  The Economist,  June 16, 2011. \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   353bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   353 7/25/13   2:39 AM7/25/13   2:39 AMFinal PDF to printer\n354 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nthe signals lose their value as they become widely known because a buy signal, for instance, \nwould result in an immediate price increase. \n The    semistrong-form    hypothesis states that all publicly available information regard-\ning the prospects of a firm must be reflected already in the stock price. Such information includes, in addition to past prices, fundamental data on the firm\u2019s product line, quality of management, balance sheet composition, patents held, earning forecasts, and account-ing practices. Again, if investors have access to such information from publicly available sources, one would expect it to be reflected in stock prices. \n Finally, the    strong-form    version of the efficient market hypothesis states that stock prices \nreflect all information relevant to the firm, even including information available only to company insiders. This version of the hypothesis is quite extreme. Few would argue with the proposition that corporate officers have access to pertinent information long enough before public release to enable them to profit from trading on that information. Indeed, much of the activity of the Securities and Exchange Commission is directed toward preventing insid-\ners from profiting by exploiting their privileged situation. Rule 10b-5 of the Security Exchange Act of 1934 sets limits on trading by corporate officers, directors, and substantial owners, requiring them to report trades to the SEC. These insiders, their relatives, and any associates who trade on information supplied by insiders are considered in violation of the law. \n Defining insider trading is not always easy, however. After all, stock analysts are in \nthe business of uncovering information not already widely known to market participants. As we saw in Chapter 3 as well as in the nearby box, the distinction between private and inside information is sometimes murky. \n Notice one thing that all versions of the EMH have in common: They all assert that \nprices should reflect  available  information. We do not expect traders to be superhuman or \nmarket prices to always be right. We will always wish for more information about a com-pany\u2019s prospects than will be available. Sometimes market prices will turn out in retrospect to have been outrageously high, at other times absurdly low. The EMH asserts only that at the given time, using current information, we cannot be sure if today\u2019s prices will ulti-mately prove themselves to have been too high or too low. If markets are rational, however, we can expect them to be correct on average.     \n     a.  Suppose you observed that high-level managers make superior returns on investments in their \ncompany\u2019s stock. Would this be a violation of weak-form market efficiency? Would it be a violation of strong-form market efficiency?  \n    b.  If the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis is valid, must the strong form also hold? Conversely, does strong-form efficiency imply weak-form efficiency?    CONCEPT CHECK 11.1 \n   Technical Analysis \n    Technical analysis    is essentially the search for recurrent and predictable patterns in stock \nprices. Although technicians recognize the value of information regarding future economic prospects of the firm, they believe that such information is not necessary for a successful trading strategy. This is because whatever the fundamental reason for a change in stock price, if the stock price responds slowly enough, the analyst will be able to identify a trend    11.2 Implications of the EMH \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   354bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   354 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 11 The Efficient Market Hypothesis 355\nthat can be exploited during the adjustment period. The key to successful technical analy-\nsis is a sluggish response of stock prices to fundamental supply-and-demand factors. This prerequisite, of course, is diametrically opposed to the notion of an efficient market. \n Technical analysts are sometimes called  chartists  because they study records or charts of \npast stock prices, hoping to find patterns they can exploit to make a profit. As an example of technical analysis, consider the  relative strength  approach. The chartist compares stock per-\nformance over a recent period to performance of the market or other stocks in the same indus-try. A simple version of relative strength takes the ratio of the stock price to a market indicator such as the S&P 500 index. If the ratio increases over time, the stock is said to exhibit relative strength because its price performance is better than that of the broad market. Such strength presumably may continue for a long enough period of time to offer profit opportunities. \n One of the most commonly heard components of technical analysis is the notion of \n   resistance levels    or    support levels.      These values are said to be price levels above which it \nis difficult for stock prices to rise, or below which it is unlikely for them to fall, and they \nare believed to be levels determined by market psychology. \n \n Consider stock XYZ, which traded for several months at a price of $72 and then declined \nto $65. If the stock eventually begins to increase in price, $72 is considered a resistance level (according to this theory) because investors who bought originally at $72 will be eager to sell their shares as soon as they can break even on their investment. Therefore, at prices near $72 a wave of selling pressure would exist. Such activity imparts a type of \u201cmemory\u201d to the market that allows past price history to influence current stock prospects.  Example 11.2 Resistance Levels \n The efficient market hypothesis implies that technical analysis is without merit. The past \nhistory of prices and trading volume is publicly available at minimal cost. Therefore, any \ninformation that was ever available from analyzing past prices has already been reflected in stock prices. As investors compete to exploit their common knowledge of a stock\u2019s price history, they necessarily drive stock prices to levels where expected rates of return are exactly commensurate with risk. At those levels one cannot expect abnormal returns. \n As an example of how this process works, consider what would happen if the market \nbelieved that a level of $72 truly was a resistance level for stock XYZ in Example 11.2. No one would be willing to purchase the stock at a price of $71.50, because it would have almost no room to increase in price, but ample room to fall. However, if no one would buy it at $71.50, then $71.50 would become a resistance level. But then, using a similar analysis, no one would buy it at $71, or $70, and so on. The notion of a resistance level is a logical conundrum. Its simple resolution is the recognition that if the stock is ever to sell at $71.50, investors  must  believe that the price \ncan as easily increase as fall. The fact that investors are willing to purchase (or even hold) the stock at $71.50 is evidence of their belief that they can earn a fair expected rate of return at that price. \n \n An interesting question is whether a technical rule that seems to work will continue \nto work in the future once it becomes widely recognized. A clever analyst may occasion-ally uncover a profitable trading rule, but the real test of efficient markets is whether the rule itself becomes reflected in stock prices once its value is discovered. Once a useful  If everyone in the market believes in resistance \nlevels, why do these beliefs not become self- fulfilling prophecies?

In this sense, price patterns ought to be  self-destructing.  \n Thus the market dynamic is one of a continual search for profitable trading rules, \nfollowed by destruction by overuse of those rules found to be successful, followed by more searching for yet-undiscovered rules.  \n  Fundamental Analysis \n    Fundamental analysis    uses earnings and dividend prospects of the firm, expectations of future interest rates, and risk evaluation of the firm to determine proper stock prices. Ultimately, it represents an attempt to determine the present discounted value of all the payments a stockholder will receive from each share of stock. If that value exceeds the stock price, the fundamental analyst would recommend purchasing the stock. \n Fundamental analysts usually start with a study of past earnings and an examination \nof company balance sheets. They supplement this analysis with further detailed economic analysis, ordinarily including an evaluation of the quality of the firm\u2019s management, the firm\u2019s standing within its industry, and the prospects for the industry as a whole. The hope is to attain insight into future performance of the firm that is not yet recognized by the rest of the market. Chapters 17 through 19 provide a detailed discussion of the types of analy-ses that underlie fundamental analysis. \n Once again, the efficient market hypothesis predicts that  most  fundamental analysis also \nis doomed to failure. If the analyst relies on publicly available earnings and industry infor-mation, his or her evaluation of the firm\u2019s prospects is not likely to be significantly more accurate than those of rival analysts. Many well-informed, well-financed firms conduct such market research, and in the face of such competition it will be difficult to uncover data not also available to other analysts. Only analysts with a unique insight will be rewarded. \n Fundamental analysis is much more difficult than merely identifying well-run firms with \ngood prospects. Discovery of good firms does an investor no good in and of itself if the rest of the market also knows those firms are good. If the knowledge is already public, the investor will be forced to pay a high price for those firms and will not realize a superior rate of return. \n The trick is not to identify firms that are good, but to find firms that are  better  than \neveryone else\u2019s estimate. Similarly, poorly run firms can be great bargains if they are not quite as bad as their stock prices suggest. \n This is why fundamental analysis is difficult. It is not enough to do a good analysis of \na firm; you can make money only if your analysis is better than that of your competitors because the market price will already reflect all commonly recognized information.  \n  Active versus Passive Portfolio Management \n By now it is apparent that casual efforts to pick stocks are not likely to pay off. Competi-tion among investors ensures that any easily implemented stock evaluation technique will be used widely enough so that any insights derived will be reflected in stock prices. Only serious analysis and uncommon techniques are likely to generate the  differential  insight \nnecessary to yield trading profits. \n Moreover, these techniques are economically feasible only for managers of large \n portfolios. If you have only $100,000 to invest, even a 1% per year improvement in performance generates only $1,000 per year, hardly enough to justify herculean efforts. The billion-dollar manager, however, reaps extra income of $10 million annually from the same 1% increment. \n If small investors are not in a favored position to conduct active portfolio management, \nwhat are their choices? The small investor probably is better off investing in mutual funds. By pooling resources in this way, small investors can gain from economies of scale. \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   356bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   356 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 11 The Efficient Market Hypothesis 357\n More difficult decisions remain, though. Can investors be sure that even large mutual \nfunds have the ability or resources to uncover mispriced stocks? Furthermore, will any \nmispricing be sufficiently large to repay the costs entailed in active portfolio management? \n Proponents of the efficient market hypothesis believe that active management is largely \nwasted effort and unlikely to justify the expenses incurred. Therefore, they advocate a     passive investment strategy    that makes no attempt to outsmart the market. A passive strategy aims only at establishing a well-diversified portfolio of securities without attempt-ing to find under- or overvalued stocks. Passive management is usually characterized by a buy-and-hold strategy. Because the efficient market theory indicates that stock prices are at fair levels, given all available information, it makes no sense to buy and sell securities frequently, which generates large trading costs without increasing expected performance. \n One common strategy for passive management is to create an    index fund,      which is a \nfund designed to replicate the performance of a broad-based index of stocks. For example, Vanguard\u2019s 500 Index Fund holds stocks in direct proportion to their weight in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock price index. The performance of the 500 Index Fund therefore repli-cates the performance of the S&P 500. Investors in this fund obtain broad diversification with relatively low management fees. The fees can be kept to a minimum because Vanguard does not need to pay analysts to assess stock prospects and does not incur transaction costs from high portfolio turnover. Indeed, while the typical annual charge for an actively man-aged equity fund is around 1% of assets, the expense ratio of the 500 Index Fund is only .17%. Vanguard\u2019s 500 Index Fund is among the largest equity mutual funds with over $100 billion of assets in 2012, and about 15% of assets in equity funds are indexed. \n Indexing need not be limited to the S&P 500, however. For example, some of the funds \noffered by the Vanguard Group track the broader-based CRSP  \n8   index of the total U.S. \nequity market, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the CRSP index of small-capitalization U.S. companies, and the  Financial Times  indexes of the European and Pacific \nBasin equity markets. Several other mutual fund complexes offer indexed portfolios, but Vanguard dominates the retail market for indexed products.\n  \n Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are a close (and often lower-expense) alternative to \nindexed mutual funds. As noted in Chapter 4, these are shares in diversified portfolios that can be bought or sold just like shares of individual stock. ETFs matching several broad stock market indexes such as the S&P 500 or CRSP indexes and dozens of interna-tional and industry stock indexes are available to inves-tors who want to hold a diversified sector of a market without attempting active security selection.   \n  The Role of Portfolio Management in an Efficient Market \n If the market is efficient, why not pick stocks by throwing darts at  The Wall Street Journal  \ninstead of trying rationally to choose a stock portfolio? This is a tempting conclusion to draw from the notion that security prices are fairly set, but it is far too facile. There is a role for rational portfolio management, even in perfectly efficient markets. \n You have learned that a basic principle in portfolio selection is diversification. Even \nif all stocks are priced fairly, each still poses firm-specific risk that can be eliminated through diversification. Therefore, rational security selection, even in an efficient market, calls for the selection of a well-diversified portfolio providing the systematic risk level that the investor wants. \n Rational investment policy also requires that tax considerations be reflected in secu-\nrity choice. High-tax-bracket investors generally will not want the same securities that low \n  8 CRSP is the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago.  What would happen to market efficiency if  all  \ninvestors attempted to follow a passive strategy?

At an obvious level, high-bracket investors find it advanta-\ngeous to buy tax-exempt municipal bonds despite their relatively low pretax yields, whereas those same bonds are unattractive to low-tax-bracket or tax-exempt investors. At a more sub-tle level, high-bracket investors might want to tilt their portfolios in the direction of capital gains as opposed to interest income, because capital gains are taxed less heavily and because the option to defer the realization of capital gains income is more valuable the higher the current tax bracket. Hence these investors may prefer stocks that yield low dividends yet offer greater expected capital gains income. They also will be more attracted to investment opportunities for which returns are sensitive to tax benefits, such as real estate ventures. \n A third argument for rational portfolio management relates to the particular risk profile \nof the investor. For example, a Toyota executive whose annual bonus depends on Toyota\u2019s profits generally should not invest additional amounts in auto stocks. To the extent that his or her compensation already depends on Toyota\u2019s well-being, the executive is already overinvested in Toyota and should not exacerbate the lack of diversification. This lesson was learned with considerable pain in September 2008 by Lehman Brothers employees who were famously invested in their own firm when the company failed. Roughly 30% of the shares in the firm were owned by its 24,000 employees, and their losses on those shares totaled around $10 billion. \n Investors of varying ages also might warrant different portfolio policies with regard \nto risk bearing. For example, older investors who are essentially living off savings might choose to avoid long-term bonds whose market values fluctuate dramatically with changes in interest rates (discussed in Part Four). Because these investors are living off accumulated savings, they require conservation of principal. In contrast, younger investors might be more inclined toward long-term inflation-indexed bonds. The steady flow of real income over long periods of time that is locked in with these bonds can be more important than preservation of principal to those with long life expectancies. \n In conclusion, there is a role for portfolio management even in an efficient market. \nInvestors\u2019 optimal positions will vary according to factors such as age, tax bracket, risk aversion, and employment. The role of the portfolio manager in an efficient market is to tailor the portfolio to these needs, rather than to beat the market.  \n  Resource Allocation \n We\u2019ve focused so far on the investment implications of the efficient market hypothesis. Deviations from efficiency may offer profit opportunities to better-informed traders at the expense of less-informed ones. \n However, deviations from informational efficiency would also result in a large cost that \nwill be borne by all citizens, namely, inefficient resource allocation. Recall that in a capital-ist economy, investments in  real  assets such as plant, equipment, and know-how are guided \nin large part by the prices of financial assets. For example, if the value of telecommunica-tion capacity reflected in stock market prices exceeds the cost of installing such capacity, managers might justifiably conclude that telecom investments seem to have positive net present value. In this manner, capital market prices guide allocation of real resources. \n If markets were inefficient and securities commonly mispriced, then resources would \nbe systematically misallocated. Corporations with overpriced securities would be able to obtain capital too cheaply, and corporations with undervalued securities might forgo invest-ment opportunities because the cost of raising capital would be too high. Therefore, ineffi-cient capital markets would diminish one of the most potent benefits of a market economy. As an example of what can go wrong, consider the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, which sent a strong but, as it turned out, wildly overoptimistic signal about prospects for Internet and telecommunication firms and ultimately led to substantial overinvestment in those industries. \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   358bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   358 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 11 The Efficient Market Hypothesis 359\n Before writing off markets as a means to guide resource allocation, however, one has \nto be reasonable about what can be expected from market forecasts. In particular, you \nshouldn\u2019t confuse an efficient market, where all available information is reflected in prices, with a perfect-foresight market. As we said earlier, \u201call available information\u201d is still far from complete information, and generally rational market forecasts will sometimes be wrong; sometimes, in fact, they will be very wrong.    \n  The notion of informationally efficient markets leads to a powerful research methodology. \nIf security prices reflect all currently available information, then price changes must reflect new information. Therefore, it seems that one should be able to measure the importance of an event of interest by examining price changes during the period in which the event occurs. \n An    event study    describes a technique of empirical financial research that enables an \nobserver to assess the impact of a particular event on a firm\u2019s stock price. A stock market analyst might want to study the impact of dividend changes on stock prices, for example. An event study would quantify the relationship between dividend changes and stock returns. \n Analyzing the impact of any particular event is more difficult than it might at first appear. \nOn any day, stock prices respond to a wide range of economic news such as updated fore-casts for GDP, inflation rates, interest rates, or corporate profitability. Isolating the part of a stock price movement that is attributable to a specific event is not a trivial exercise. \n The general approach starts with a proxy for what the stock\u2019s return would have been \nin the absence of the event. The    abnormal return    due to the event is estimated as the dif-\nference between the stock\u2019s actual return and this benchmark. Several methodologies for estimating the benchmark return are used in practice. For example, a very simple approach measures the stock\u2019s abnormal return as its return minus that of a broad market index. An obvious refinement is to compare the stock\u2019s return to those of other stocks matched accord-ing to criteria such as firm size, beta, recent performance, or ratio of price to book value per share. Another approach estimates normal returns using an asset pricing model such as the CAPM or one of its multifactor generalizations such as the Fama-French three-factor model. \n Many researchers have used a \u201cmarket model\u201d to estimate abnormal returns. This \napproach is based on the index models we introduced in Chapter 9. Recall that a single-index model holds that stock returns are determined by a market factor and a firm-specific factor. The stock return,  r  \n t  , during a given period  t,  would be expressed mathematically as   \n rt 5 a 1 br Mt 1 e t  (11.1)   \n where  r   Mt   is the market\u2019s rate of return during the period and  e   t   is the part of a security\u2019s \nreturn resulting from firm-specific events. The parameter  b  measures sensitivity to the \nmarket return, and  a  is the average rate of return the stock would realize in a period with \na zero market return.  9   Equation 11.1 therefore provides a decomposition of  r   t   into market \nand firm-specific factors. The firm-specific or abnormal return may be interpreted as the \nunexpected return that results from the event.   \n Determination of the abnormal return in a given period requires an estimate of  e   t  . \nTherefore, we rewrite Equation 11.1:   \n et 5 r t 2 (a 2 br Mt)  (11.2)      11.3 Event Studies \n  9 We know from Chapter 9 that the CAPM implies that the intercept a in Equation 11.1 should equal  r   f   (1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 b ). \nNevertheless, it is customary to estimate the intercept in this equation empirically rather than imposing the CAPM \nvalue. One justification for this practice is that empirically fitted security market lines seem flatter than predicted by the CAPM (see Chapter 13), which would make the intercept implied by the CAPM too small. \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   359bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   359 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n360 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n Equation 11.2 has a simple interpretation: The residual,  e   t  , that is, the component presum-\nably due to the event in question, is the stock\u2019s return over and above what one would predict \nbased on broad market movements in that period, given the stock\u2019s sensitivity to the market. \n The market model is a highly flexible tool, because it can be generalized to include \nricher models of benchmark returns, for example, by including industry as well as broad market returns on the right-hand side of Equation 11.1, or returns on indexes constructed to match characteristics such as firm size. However, one must be careful that regression parameters in Equation 11.1 (the intercept  a  and slope  b ) are estimated properly. In par-\nticular, they must be estimated using data sufficiently separated in time from the event in question that they are not affected by event-period abnormal stock performance. In part because of this vulnerability of the market model, returns on characteristic-matched port-folios have become more widely used benchmarks in recent years. \n \n Suppose that the analyst has estimated that  a \u00a0 5 \u00a0.05% and  b \u00a0 5 \u00a0.8. On a day that the \nmarket goes up by 1%, you would predict from Equation 11.1 that the stock should rise \nby an expected value of .05%\u00a0 1 \u00a0.8\u00a0 3 \u00a01%\u00a0 5 \u00a0.85%. If the stock actually rises by 2%, \nthe analyst would infer that firm-specific news that day caused an additional stock return of 2%\u00a0 2 \u00a0.85%\u00a0 5 \u00a01.15%. This is the abnormal return for the day.  Example 11.3 Abnormal Returns \n We measure the impact of an event by estimating the abnormal return on a stock (or \ngroup of stocks) at the moment the information about the event becomes known to the \nmarket. For example, in a study of the impact of merger attempts on the stock prices of tar-get firms, the announcement date is the date on which the public is informed that a merger is to be attempted. The abnormal returns of each firm surrounding the announcement date are computed, and the statistical significance and magnitude of the typical abnormal return are assessed to determine the impact of the newly released information. \n One concern that complicates event studies arises from  leakage  of information. Leakage \noccurs when information regarding a relevant event is released to a small group of inves-tors before official public release. In this case the stock price might start to increase (in the case of a \u201cgood news\u201d announcement) days or weeks before the official announcement date. Any abnormal return on the announcement date is then a poor indicator of the total impact of the information release. A better indicator would be the    cumulative abnormal \nreturn,      which is simply the sum of all abnormal returns over the time period of interest. The cumulative abnormal return thus captures the total firm-specific stock movement for an entire period when the market might be responding to new information. \n  Figure\u00a011.1  (earlier in the chapter) presents the results from a fairly typical event study. \nThe authors of this study were interested in leakage of information before merger announce-ments and constructed a sample of 194 firms that were targets of takeover attempts. In most takeovers, stockholders of the acquired firms sell their shares to the acquirer at sub-stantial premiums over market value. Announcement of a takeover attempt is good news for shareholders of the target firm and therefore should cause stock prices to jump. \n  Figure\u00a011.1  confirms the good-news nature of the announcements. On the announce-\nment day, called day 0, the average cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for the sample of takeover candidates increases substantially, indicating a large and positive abnormal return on the announcement date. Notice that immediately after the announcement date the CAR no longer increases or decreases significantly. This is in accord with the efficient mar-ket hypothesis. Once the new information became public, the stock prices jumped almost \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   360bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   360 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 11 The Efficient Market Hypothesis 361\nimmediately in response to the good news. With prices once again fairly set, reflecting the \neffect of the new information, further abnormal returns on any particular day are equally likely to be positive or negative. In fact, for a sample of many firms, the average abnormal return should be extremely close to zero, and thus the CAR will show neither upward nor downward drift. This is precisely the pattern shown in  Figure\u00a011.1 . \n The pattern of returns for the days preceding the public announcement date yields some \ninteresting evidence about efficient markets and information leakage. If insider trading rules were perfectly obeyed and perfectly enforced, stock prices should show no abnormal returns on days before the public release of relevant news, because no special firm-specific information would be available to the market before public announcement. Instead, we should observe a clean jump in the stock price only on the announcement day. In fact,  Figure\u00a0 11.1  shows that the prices of the takeover targets clearly start an upward drift 30 days before the public announcement. It appears that information is leaking to some market participants who then purchase the stocks before the public announcement. Such evidence of leakage appears almost universally in event studies, suggesting at least some abuse of insider trading rules. \n Actually, the SEC also can take some comfort from patterns such as that in  Figure\u00a011.1 . \nIf insider trading rules were widely and flagrantly violated, we would expect to see abnor-mal returns earlier than they appear in these results. For example, in the case of mergers, the CAR would turn positive as soon as acquiring firms decided on their takeover targets, because insiders would start trading immediately. By the time of the public announce-ment, the insiders would have bid up the stock prices of target firms to levels reflecting the merger attempt, and the abnormal returns on the actual public announcement date would be close to zero. The dramatic increase in the CAR that we see on the announcement date indicates that a good deal of these announcements are indeed news to the market and that stock prices did not already reflect complete knowledge about the takeovers. It would appear, therefore, that SEC enforcement does have a substantial effect on restricting insider trading, even if some amount of it still persists. \n Event study methodology has become a widely accepted tool to measure the economic \nimpact of a wide range of events. For example, the SEC regularly uses event studies to measure illicit gains captured by traders who may have violated insider trading or other securities laws.  \n10   Event studies are also used in fraud cases, where the courts must assess \ndamages caused by a fraudulent activity.      \n  10 For a review of SEC applications of this technique, see Mark Mitchell and Jeffry Netter, \u201cThe Role of Financial \nEconomics in Securities Fraud Cases: Applications at the Securities and Exchange Commission,\u201d  The Business \nLawyer  49 (February 1994), pp. 545\u201390.  Suppose the stock of a company with market value of $100 million falls by 4% on \nthe day that news of an accounting scandal surfaces. The rest of the market, however, generally did well that day. The market indexes were up sharply, and on the basis of the usual relationship between the stock and the market, one would have expected a 2% gain on the stock. We would conclude that the impact of the scandal was a 6% drop in value, the difference between the 2% gain that we would have expected and the 4% drop actually observed. One might then infer that the damages sustained from the scan-dal were $6 million, because the value of the firm (after adjusting for general market movements) fell by 6% of $100 million when investors became aware of the news and reassessed the value of the stock.  Example 11.4 Using Abnormal Returns to Infer Damages \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   361bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   361 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n362 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n Suppose that we see negative abnormal returns (declining CARs) after an announce-\nment date. Is this a violation of efficient markets?  CONCEPT CHECK 11.4 \n   The Issues \n Not surprisingly, the efficient market hypothesis does not exactly arouse enthusiasm in the \ncommunity of professional portfolio managers. It implies that a great deal of the activity of portfolio managers\u2014the search for undervalued securities\u2014is at best wasted effort, and quite probably harmful to clients because it costs money and leads to imperfectly diversified portfolios. Consequently, the EMH has never been widely accepted on Wall Street, and debate continues today on the degree to which security analysis can improve investment performance. Before discussing empirical tests of the hypothesis, we want to note three factors that together imply that the debate probably never will be settled: the  magnitude issue,  the  selection bias issue,  and the  lucky event issue.  \n  The Magnitude Issue   We noted that an investment manager overseeing a $5 billion \nportfolio who can improve performance by only .1% per year will increase invest-\nment earnings by .001\u00a0 3 \u00a0$5\u00a0billion\u00a0 5  \u00a0$5\u00a0million annually. This manager clearly would \nbe worth her salary! Yet can we, as observers, statistically measure her contribution? Probably not: A .1% contribution would be swamped by the yearly volatility of the market. Remember, the annual standard deviation of the well-diversified S&P 500 index has been around 20%. Against these fluctuations, a small increase in performance would be hard to detect. \n All might agree that stock prices are very close to fair values and that only managers of \nlarge portfolios can earn enough trading profits to make the exploitation of minor mispric-ing worth the effort. According to this view, the actions of intelligent investment managers are the driving force behind the constant evolution of market prices to fair levels. Rather than ask the qualitative question, Are markets efficient? we ought instead to ask a more quantitative question: How efficient are markets?  \n  The Selection Bias Issue   Suppose that you discover an investment scheme that \ncould really make money. You have two choices: either publish your technique in  The \nWall Street Journal  to win fleeting fame, or keep your technique secret and use it to earn \nmillions of dollars. Most investors would choose the latter option, which presents us with a conundrum. Only investors who find that an investment scheme cannot generate abnor-mal returns will be willing to report their findings to the whole world. Hence opponents of the efficient markets\u2019 view of the world always can use evidence that various techniques do not provide investment rewards as proof that the techniques that do work simply are not being reported to the public. This is a problem in  selection bias;   the outcomes we are \nable to observe have been preselected in favor of failed attempts. Therefore, we cannot fairly evaluate the true ability of portfolio managers to generate winning stock market strategies.     11.4 Are Markets Efficient? \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   362bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   362 7/25/13   2:39 AM7/25/13   2:39 AMFinal PDF to printer\n363  How to Guarantee a Successful Market Newsletter \n Suppose you want to make your fortune publishing a mar-\nket newsletter. You need first to convince potential sub-scribers that you have talent worth paying for. But what if you have no talent? The solution is simple: Start eight newsletters. \n In year 1, let four of your newsletters predict an up-\nmarket and four a down-market. In year 2, let half of the \noriginally optimistic group of newsletters continue to pre-dict an up-market and the other half a down-market. Do the same for the originally pessimistic group. Continue in this manner to obtain the pattern of predictions in the table that follows (U\u00a0  5 \u00a0 prediction of an up-market, \nD\u00a0 5 \u00a0prediction of a down-market). \n After 3 years, no matter what has happened to the \nmarket, one of the newsletters would have had a perfect \nprediction record. This is because after 3 years there are 2 \n3 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 8 outcomes for the market, and we have covered \nall eight possibilities with the eight newsletters. Now, we \nsimply slough off the seven unsuccessful newsletters, and market the eighth newsletter based on its perfect track record. If we want to establish a newsletter with a per-fect track record over a 4-year period, we need 2 \n4 \u00a0 5 \u00a016 newsletters. A 5-year period requires 32 newsletters, and \nso on. \n After the fact, the one newsletter that was always \nright will attract attention for your uncanny foresight and \ninvestors will rush to pay large fees for its advice. Your fortune is made, and you have never even researched the market! \n  WARNING:  This scheme is illegal! The point, however, is \nthat with hundreds of market newsletters, you can find one \nthat has stumbled onto an apparently remarkable string of successful predictions without any real degree of skill. After the fact,  someone\u2019s  prediction history can seem to imply \ngreat forecasting skill. This person is the one we will read about in  The Wall Street Journal;  the others will be forgotten.    \n    Newsletter Predictions    \nYear    1     2     3      4      5      6      7      8   \n1 UUUUDDDD\n2 UUDDUUDD\n3 UDUDUDUD WORDS FROM THE STREET \n  The Lucky Event Issue   In virtually any month it seems we read an article about \nsome investor or investment company with a fantastic investment performance over the \nrecent past. Surely the superior records of such investors disprove the efficient market hypothesis. \n Yet this conclusion is far from obvious. As an analogy to the investment game, consider \na contest to flip the most number of heads out of 50 trials using a fair coin. The expected outcome for any person is, of course, 50% heads and 50% tails. If 10,000 people, however, compete in this contest, it would not be surprising if at least one or two contestants flipped more than 75% heads. In fact, elementary statistics tells us that the expected number of contestants flipping 75% or more heads would be two. It would be silly, though, to crown these people the \u201chead-flipping champions of the world.\u201d Obviously, they are simply the contestants who happened to get lucky on the day of the event. (See the nearby box.)  \n The analogy to efficient markets is clear. Under the hypothesis that any stock is fairly \npriced given all available information, any bet on a stock is simply a coin toss. There is equal likelihood of winning or losing the bet. However, if many investors using a variety of schemes make fair bets, statistically speaking,  some  of those investors will be lucky and \nwin a great majority of the bets. For every big winner, there may be many big losers, but we never hear of these managers. The winners, though, turn up in  The Wall Street Journal  as \nthe latest stock market gurus; then they can make a fortune publishing market newsletters. \n Our point is that after the fact there will have been at least one successful investment \nscheme. A doubter will call the results luck; the successful investor will call it skill. The proper test would be to see whether the successful investors can repeat their performance in another period, yet this approach is rarely taken. \n With these caveats in mind, we turn now to some of the empirical tests of the efficient \nmarket hypothesis.    \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   363bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   363 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n364 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n  Weak-Form Tests: Patterns in Stock Returns \n  Returns over Short Horizons   Early tests of efficient markets were tests of the \nweak form. Could speculators find trends in past prices that would enable them to earn \nabnormal profits? This is essentially a test of the efficacy of technical analysis. \n One way of discerning trends in stock prices is by measuring the  serial correlation   \nof stock market returns. Serial correlation refers to the tendency for stock returns to be related to past returns. Positive serial correlation means that positive returns tend to fol-low positive returns (a momentum type of property). Negative serial correlation means that positive returns tend to be followed by negative returns (a reversal or \u201ccorrection\u201d property). Both Conrad and Kaul  \n11   and Lo and MacKinlay  12   examine weekly returns of \nNYSE stocks and find positive serial correlation over short horizons. However, the cor-relation coefficients of weekly returns tend to be fairly small, at least for large stocks for which price data are the most reliably up-to-date. Thus, while these studies demonstrate weak price trends over short periods,  \n13   the evidence does not clearly suggest the existence \nof trading opportunities.  \n While broad market indexes demonstrate only weak serial correlation, there appears to \nbe stronger momentum in performance across market sectors exhibiting the best and worst recent returns. In an investigation of intermediate-horizon stock price behavior (using 3- to 12-month holding periods), Jegadeesh and Titman  \n14   found a    momentum effect    in which \ngood or bad recent performance of particular stocks continues over time. They conclude that while the performance of individual stocks is highly unpredictable,  portfolios  of the \nbest-performing stocks in the recent past appear to outperform other stocks with enough reliability to offer profit opportunities. Thus, it appears that there is evidence of short- to intermediate-horizon price momentum in both the aggregate market and cross-sectionally (i.e., across particular stocks).  \n  Returns over Long Horizons   Although studies of short- to intermediate-horizon \nreturns have detected momentum in stock market prices, tests of long-horizon returns (i.e., \nreturns over multiyear periods) have found suggestions of pronounced  negative  long-term  Legg Mason\u2019s Value Trust, managed by Bill Miller, outperformed the S&P 500 in each of the 15 years end-\ning in 2005. Is Miller\u2019s performance sufficient to dissuade you from a belief in efficient markets? If not, would  any  performance record be sufficient to dissuade you? Now consider that in the next 3 years, the \nfund dramatically underperformed the S&P 500; by the end of 2008, its cumulative 18-year performance was barely different from the index. Does this affect your opinion?

Such overreaction leads to positive serial correlation (momentum) over short time horizons. Subsequent correction of the overreaction leads to poor performance following good performance and vice versa. The corrections mean that a run of positive returns even-tually will tend to be followed by negative returns, leading to negative serial correlation over longer horizons. These episodes of apparent overshooting followed by correction give the stock market the appearance of fluctuating around its fair value.  \n These long-horizon results are dramatic but still not conclusive. An alternative interpre-\ntation of these results holds that they indicate only that the market risk premium varies over time. For example, when the risk premium and the required return on the market rises, stock prices will fall. When the market then rises (on average) at this higher rate of return, the data convey the impression of a stock price recovery. The apparent overshooting and correction are in fact no more than a rational response of market prices to changes in discount rates. \n In addition to studies suggestive of overreaction in overall stock market returns over \nlong horizons, many other studies suggest that over long horizons, extreme performance in particular securities also tends to reverse itself: The stocks that have performed best in the recent past seem to underperform the rest of the market in following periods, while the worst past performers tend to offer above-average future performance. DeBondt and Thaler  \n16   and \nChopra, Lakonishok, and Ritter  17   find strong tendencies for poorly performing stocks in one \nperiod to experience sizable reversals over the subsequent period, while the best-performing stocks in a given period tend to follow with poor performance in the following period. \n For example, the DeBondt and Thaler study found that if one were to rank the perfor-\nmance of stocks over a 5-year period and then group stocks into portfolios based on invest-ment performance, the base-period \u201closer\u201d portfolio (defined as the 35 stocks with the worst investment performance) outperformed the \u201cwinner\u201d portfolio (the top 35 stocks) by an average of 25% (cumulative return) in the following 3-year period. This    reversal effect,      \nin which losers rebound and winners fade back, suggests that the stock market overreacts to relevant news. After the overreaction is recognized, extreme investment performance is reversed. This phenomenon would imply that a  contrarian  investment strategy\u2014investing \nin recent losers and avoiding recent winners\u2014should be profitable. Moreover, these returns seem pronounced enough to be exploited profitably. \n Thus it appears that there may be short-run momentum but long-run reversal patterns in \nprice behavior both for the market as a whole and across sectors of the market. One inter-pretation of this pattern is that short-run overreaction (which causes momentum in prices) may lead to long-term reversals (when the market recognizes its past error).   \n  Predictors of Broad Market Returns \n Several studies have documented the ability of easily observed variables to predict mar-ket returns. For example, Fama and French  \n18   showed that the return on the aggregate \nstock market tends to be higher when the dividend/price ratio, the dividend yield, is high. \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   365bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   365 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n366 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nCampbell and Shiller  19   found that the earnings yield can predict market returns. Keim and \nStambaugh  20   showed that bond market data such as the spread between yields on high- and \nlow-grade corporate bonds also help predict broad market returns.  \n Again, the interpretation of these results is difficult. On the one hand, they may imply that \nabnormal stock returns can be predicted, in violation of the efficient market hypothesis. More \nprobably, however, these variables are proxying for variation in the market risk premium. For example, given a level of dividends or earnings, stock prices will be lower and dividend and earnings yields will be higher when the risk premium (and therefore the expected market return) is higher. Thus a high dividend or earnings yield will be associated with higher market returns. This does not indicate a violation of market efficiency. The predictability of market returns is due to predictability in the risk premium, not in risk-adjusted abnormal returns. \n Fama and French  \n21   showed that the yield spread between high- and low-grade bonds \nhas greater predictive power for returns on low-grade bonds than for returns on high-grade bonds, and greater predictive power for stock returns than for bond returns, suggesting that the predictability in returns is in fact a risk premium rather than evidence of market inef-ficiency. Similarly, the fact that the dividend yield on stocks helps to predict bond market returns suggests that the yield captures a risk premium common to both markets rather than mispricing in the equity market.\n  \n  Semistrong Tests: Market Anomalies \n Fundamental analysis uses a much wider range of information to create portfolios than does technical analysis. Investigations of the efficacy of fundamental analysis ask whether publicly available information beyond the trading history of a security can be used to improve investment performance, and therefore they are tests of semistrong-form market efficiency. Surprisingly, several easily accessible statistics, for example, a stock\u2019s price\u2013earnings ratio or its market capitalization, seem to predict abnormal risk-adjusted returns. Findings such as these, which we will review in the following pages, are difficult to rec-oncile with the efficient market hypothesis, and therefore are often referred to as efficient market    anomalies.      \n A difficulty in interpreting these tests is that we usually need to adjust for portfolio risk \nbefore evaluating the success of an investment strategy. Some tests, for example, have used the CAPM to adjust for risk. However, we know that even if beta is a relevant descriptor of stock risk, the empirically measured quantitative trade-off between risk as measured by beta and expected return differs from the predictions of the CAPM. (We review this evi-dence in Chapter 13.) If we use the CAPM to adjust portfolio returns for risk, inappropriate adjustments may lead to the conclusion that various portfolio strategies can generate supe-rior returns, when in fact it simply is the risk adjustment procedure that has failed. \n Another way to put this is to note that tests of risk-adjusted returns are  joint tests  of the \nefficient market hypothesis  and  the risk adjustment procedure. If it appears that a portfolio \nstrategy can generate superior returns, we must then choose between rejecting the EMH and rejecting the risk adjustment technique. Usually, the risk adjustment technique is based on more-questionable assumptions than is the EMH; by opting to reject the procedure, we are left with no conclusion about market efficiency. \n 19 John Y .

The    P/E effect    holds \nup even if returns are adjusted for portfolio beta. Is this a confirmation that the market system-\natically misprices stocks according to P/E ratio? This would be an extremely surprising and, to \nus, disturbing conclusion, because analysis of P/E ratios is such a simple procedure. Although \nit may be possible to earn superior returns by using hard work and much insight, it hardly \nseems plausible that such a simplistic technique is enough to generate abnormal returns.   \n Another interpretation of these results is that returns are not properly adjusted for risk. \nIf two firms have the same expected earnings, the riskier stock will sell at a lower price and \nlower P/E ratio. Because of its higher risk, the low P/E stock also will have higher expected \nreturns. Therefore, unless the CAPM beta fully adjusts for risk, P/E will act as a useful \nadditional descriptor of risk, and will be associated with abnormal returns if the CAPM is \nused to establish benchmark performance. \n  The Small-Firm-in-January Effect   The so-called size or    small-firm effect,      \noriginally documented by Banz,  23   is illustrated in  Figure\u00a011.3 . It shows the historical per-\nformance of portfolios formed by dividing the NYSE stocks into 10 portfolios each year \naccording to firm size (i.e., the total value of outstanding equity). Average annual returns \nbetween 1926 and 2011 are consistently higher on the small-firm portfolios. The differ-\nence in average annual return between portfolio 10 (with the largest firms) and portfolio 1 \n(with the smallest firms) is 8.52%. Of course, the smaller-firm portfolios tend to be riskier. \n22 Sanjoy Basu, \u201cThe Investment Performance of Common Stocks in Relation to Their Price-Earnings Ratios: A \nTest of the Efficient Market Hypothesis,\u201d  Journal of Finance   32 (June 1977), pp. 663\u201382; and \u201cThe Relationship \nbetween Earnings Yield, Market Value, and Return for NYSE Common Stocks: Further Evidence,\u201d  Journal of \nFinancial Economics   12 (June 1983). \n23 Rolf Banz, \u201cThe Relationship between Return and Market Value of Common Stocks,\u201d  Journal of Financial \nEconomics   9 (March 1981). \n0510152025\n123456789 1 0Annual Return (%)\nSize Decile: 1 = Smallest, 10 = Largest19.38\n16.64 16.3515.7015.01 14.9114.4013.3712.71\n10.86\n Figure 11.3 Average annual return for 10 size-based portfolios, 1926\u20132011 \n  Source: Authors\u2019 calculations, using data obtained from Professor Ken French\u2019s data library at    http://\nmba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html.     \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   367bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   367 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n368 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nBut even when returns are adjusted for risk using the CAPM, there is still a consistent pre-\nmium for the smaller-sized portfolios.   \n Imagine earning a premium of this size on a billion-dollar portfolio. Yet it is remarkable \nthat following a simple (even simplistic) rule such as \u201cinvest in low-capitalization stocks\u201d should enable an investor to earn excess returns. After all, any investor can measure firm size at little cost. One would not expect such minimal effort to yield such large rewards. \n Later studies (Keim,  \n24   Reinganum,  25   and Blume and Stambaugh  26  ) showed that the \nsmall-firm effect is concentrated in January, in fact, in the first 2 weeks of January. The size effect is largely a \u201csmall-firm-in-January\u201d effect.   \n  The Neglected-Firm Effect and Liquidity Effects   Arbel and Strebel  \n27   g a v e  \nanother interpretation of the small-firm-in-January effect. Because small firms tend to be \nneglected by large institutional traders, information about smaller firms is less available. This information deficiency makes smaller firms riskier investments that command higher returns. \u201cBrand-name\u201d firms, after all, are subject to considerable monitoring from insti-tutional investors, which promises high-quality information, and presumably investors do not purchase \u201cgeneric\u201d stocks without the prospect of greater returns.\n \n As evidence for the    neglected-firm effect,      Arbel  28   divided firms into highly researched, \nmoderately researched, and neglected groups based on the number of institutions hold-ing the stock. The January effect was in fact largest for the neglected firms. An article by Merton  \n29   shows that neglected firms might be expected to earn higher equilibrium \nreturns as compensation for the risk associated with limited information. In this sense the neglected-firm premium is not strictly a market inefficiency, but is a type of risk premium.\n \n Work by Amihud and Mendelson  30   on the effect of liquidity on stock returns might be \nrelated to both the small-firm and neglected-firm effects. As we noted in Chapter 9, inves-tors will demand a rate-of-return premium to invest in less-liquid stocks that entail higher trading costs. In accord with this hypothesis, Amihud and Mendelson showed that these stocks have a strong tendency to exhibit abnormally high risk-adjusted rates of return. Because small and less-analyzed stocks as a rule are less liquid, the liquidity effect might be a partial explanation of their abnormal returns. However, this theory does not explain why the abnormal returns of small firms should be concentrated in January. In any case, exploiting these effects can be more difficult than it would appear. The high trading costs on small stocks can easily wipe out any apparent abnormal profit opportunity.\n  \n  Book-to-Market Ratios   Fama and French  31   showed that a powerful predic-\ntor of returns across securities is the ratio of the book value of the firm\u2019s equity to the \n  24 Donald B.

Fama \nand French stratified firms into \n10 groups according to book-\nto-market ratios and examined \nthe average monthly rate of \nreturn of each of the 10 groups. \n Figure\u00a0 11.4  is an updated ver-\nsion of their results. The decile \nwith the highest book-to-market \nratio had an average annual \nreturn of 16.87%, while the \nlowest-ratio decile averaged \nonly 10.92%. The dramatic \ndependence of returns on book-\nto-market ratio is independent \nof beta, suggesting either that \nhigh book-to-market ratio firms \nare relatively underpriced, or \nthat the book-to-market ratio \nis serving as a proxy for a risk \nfactor that affects equilibrium \nexpected returns.    \n In fact, Fama and French \nfound that after controlling for \nthe size and    book-to-market effects,      beta seemed to have no power to explain average \nsecurity returns.  32   This finding is an important challenge to the notion of rational markets, \nbecause it seems to imply that a factor that should affect returns\u2014systematic risk\u2014seems \nnot to matter, while a factor that should not matter\u2014the book-to-market ratio\u2014seems \ncapable of predicting future returns. We will return to the interpretation of this anomaly.   \n  Post\u2013Earnings-Announcement Price Drift   A fundamental principle of effi-\ncient markets is that any new information ought to be reflected in stock prices very rapidly. \nWhen good news is made public, for example, the stock price should jump immediately. \nA puzzling anomaly, therefore, is the apparently sluggish response of stock prices to firms\u2019 \nearnings announcements, as uncovered by Ball and Brown.  33   Their results were later con-\nfirmed and extended in many other papers.  34   \n  32 However, a study by S. P. Kothari, Jay Shanken, and Richard G. Sloan, \u201cAnother Look at the Cross-Section of \nExpected Stock Returns,\u201d  Journal of Finance   50 (March 1995), pp. 185\u2013224, finds that when betas are estimated \nusing annual rather than monthly returns, securities with high beta values do in fact have higher average returns. \nMoreover, the authors find a book-to-market effect that is attenuated compared to the results in Fama and French \nand furthermore is inconsistent across different samples of securities. They conclude that the empirical case for \nthe importance of the book-to-market ratio may be somewhat weaker than the Fama and French study would \nsuggest. \n  33 R. Ball and P.

The difference is the \u201cearnings \nsurprise.\u201d (Market expectations of \nearnings can be roughly measured \nby averaging the published earnings \nforecasts of Wall Street analysts or \nby applying trend analysis to past \nearnings.) Rendleman, Jones, and \nLatan\u00e9  35   provide an influential study \nof sluggish price response to earn-\nings announcements. They calculate \nearnings surprises for a large sample \nof firms, rank the magnitude of the \nsurprise, divide firms into 10 deciles \nbased on the size of the surprise, and \ncalculate abnormal returns for each \ndecile.  Figure\u00a011.5  plots cumulative \nabnormal returns by decile.    \n Their results are dramatic. The \ncorrelation between ranking by earn-\nings surprise and abnormal returns \nacross deciles is as predicted. There \nis a large abnormal return (a jump \nin cumulative abnormal return) on \nthe earnings announcement day \n(time 0). The abnormal return is pos-\nitive for positive-surprise firms and \nnegative for negative-surprise firms. \n The more remarkable, and interesting, result of the study concerns stock price move-\nment  after   the announcement date. The cumulative abnormal returns of positive-surprise \nstocks continue to rise\u2014in other words, exhibit momentum\u2014even after the earnings \ninformation becomes public, while the negative-surprise firms continue to suffer negative \nabnormal returns.

The ability of insiders to trade profitably in their \nown stock has been documented in studies by Jaffe,  36   Seyhun,  37   Givoly and Palmon,  38   and \nothers. Jaffe\u2019s was one of the earlier studies that documented the tendency for stock prices to rise after insiders intensively bought shares and to fall after intensive insider sales.\n  \n Can other investors benefit by following insiders\u2019 trades? The Securities and Exchange \nCommission requires all insiders to register their trading activity and it publishes these trades in an  Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings.  Since 2002, insiders \nmust report large trades to the SEC within 2 business days. Once the  Official Summary  is \npublished, the trades become public information. At that point, if markets are efficient, fully and immediately processing the information released in the  Official Summary  of trad-\ning, an investor should no longer be able to profit from following the pattern of those trades. Several Internet sites contain information on insider trading. See the Web sites at our Online Learning Center (  www.mhhe.com/bkm  ) for some suggestions. \n The study by Seyhun, which carefully tracked the public release dates of the  Official \nSummary,  found that following insider transactions would be to no avail. Although there is some tendency for stock prices to increase even after the  Official Summary  reports insider \nbuying, the abnormal returns are not of sufficient magnitude to overcome transaction costs.  \n  Interpreting the Anomalies \n How should we interpret the ever-growing anomalies literature? Does it imply that markets are grossly inefficient, allowing for simplistic trading rules to offer large profit opportuni-ties? Or are there other, more-subtle interpretations? \n  Risk Premiums or Inefficiencies?   The price-earnings, small-firm, market-to-\nbook, momentum, and long-term reversal effects are currently among the most puzzling \nphenomena in empirical finance. There are several interpretations of these effects. First note that to some extent, some of these phenomena may be related. The feature that small firms, low-market-to-book firms, and recent \u201closers\u201d seem to have in common is a stock price that has fallen considerably in recent months or years. Indeed, a firm can become a small firm or a low-market-to-book firm by suffering a sharp drop in price. These groups therefore may contain a relatively high proportion of distressed firms that have suffered recent difficulties. \n Fama and French  \n39   argue that these effects can be explained as manifestations of risk \npremiums. Using their three-factor model, introduced in the previous chapter, they show that stocks with higher betas (also known as factor loadings) on size or market-to-book factors have higher average returns; they interpret these returns as evidence of a risk pre-mium associated with the factor. This model does a much better job than the one-factor CAPM in explaining security returns. While size or book-to-market ratios per se are obvi-ously not risk factors, they perhaps might act as proxies for more fundamental deter-minants of risk. Fama and French argue that these patterns of returns may therefore be consistent with an efficient market in which expected returns are consistent with risk. In this regard, it is worth noting that returns to \u201cstyle portfolios,\u201d for example, the return on portfolios constructed based on the ratio of book-to-market value (specifically, the \n  36 Jeffrey F.

Figure\u00a011.6  shows that returns on these portfolios tend to have positive returns in \nyears prior to rapid growth in gross domestic product. We examine the Fama-French paper \nin more detail in Chapter 13.   \n The opposite interpretation is offered by Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny,  40   who argue \nthat these phenomena are evidence of inefficient markets, more specifically, of systematic \nerrors in the forecasts of stock analysts. They believe that analysts extrapolate past perfor-\nmance too far into the future, and therefore overprice firms with recent good performance \nand underprice firms with recent poor performance. Ultimately, when market participants \nrecognize their errors, prices reverse. This explanation is consistent with the reversal effect \nand also, to a degree, is consistent with the small-firm and book-to-market effects because \nfirms with sharp price drops may tend to be small or have high book-to-market ratios.  \n If Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny are correct, we ought to find that analysts system-\natically err when forecasting returns of recent \u201cwinner\u201d versus \u201closer\u201d firms.

Analysts seem overly pessimistic about firms with low growth prospects \nand overly optimistic about firms with high growth prospects. When these too-extreme expectations are \u201ccorrected,\u201d the low-expected-growth firms outperform high-expected-growth firms.  \n  Anomalies or Data Mining?   We have covered many of the so-called anomalies \ncited in the literature, but our list could go on and on. Some wonder whether these anoma-\nlies are really unexplained puzzles in financial markets, or whether they instead are an artifact of data mining. After all, if one reruns the computer database of past returns over and over and examines stock returns along enough dimensions, simple chance will cause some criteria to  appear  to predict returns. \n In this regard, it is noteworthy that some anomalies have not shown much staying \npower after being reported in the academic literature. For example, after the small-firm effect was published in the early 1980s, it promptly disappeared for much of the rest of the decade. \n Still, even acknowledging the potential for data mining, a common thread seems to \nrun through many of the anomalies we have considered, lending support to the notion that there is a real puzzle to explain. Value stocks\u2014defined by low P/E ratio, high book-to-market ratio, or depressed prices relative to historic levels\u2014seem to have provided higher average returns than \u201cglamour\u201d or growth stocks. \n One way to address the problem of data mining is to find a dataset that has not already \nbeen researched and see whether the relationship in question shows up in the new data. Such studies have revealed size, momentum, and book-to-market effects in security mar-kets around the world. While these phenomena may be a manifestation of a systematic risk premium, the precise nature of that risk is not fully understood.  \n  Anomalies over Time   We pointed out earlier that while no market can be perfectly \nefficient, in well-functioning markets, anomalies ought to be self-destructing. As market \nparticipants learn of profitable trading strategies, their attempts to exploit them should move prices to levels at which abnormal profits are no longer available. Chordia, Sub-ramanyam, and Tong  \n42   look for this dynamic in the pattern of many of the anomalies \ndiscussed in this chapter. They focus on abnormal returns associated with several char-acteristics including size, book-to-market ratio, momentum, and turnover (which may be inversely related to the neglected firm effect). They break their sample at 1993 and show that the abnormal returns associated with these characteristics in the pre-1993 period largely disappear in the post-1993 period (with the notable exception of the book-to-market effect). Their interpretation is that the market has become more efficient as knowl-edge about these anomalies percolated through the investment community. Interestingly, they find that that the attenuation of alphas is greatest in the most liquid stocks, where trading activity is least costly.\n  \n McLean and Pontiff   43   provide further insight into this phenomenon. They identify more \nthan 80 characteristics recognized in the academic literature as associated with abnormal returns. Rather than using a common break point for all characteristics, they carefully track both the publication date of each finding as well as the date the paper was first posted to the \n  42 T.

This allows them to break the sample for each finding \nat dates corresponding to when that particular finding became public. They conclude that the post-publication decay in abnormal return is about 35% (e.g., a 5% abnormal return pre-publication falls on average to 3.25% after publication).  \n44   They show that trading vol-\nume and variance in stocks identified with anomalies increases, as does short interest in \u201coverpriced\u201d stocks. These patterns are consistent with informed participants attempting to exploit newly recognized mispricing. Moreover, the decay in alpha is most pronounced for stocks that are larger, more liquid, and with low idiosyncratic risk. These are precisely the stocks for which trading activity in pursuit of reliable abnormal returns is most feasible. Thus, while abnormal returns do not fully disappear, these results are consistent with a market groping its way toward greater efficiency over time.\n    \n  Bubbles and Market Efficiency \n Every so often, asset prices seem (at least in retrospect) to lose their grounding in reality. For example, in the tulip mania in 17th-century Holland, tulip prices peaked at several times the annual income of a skilled worker. This episode has become the symbol of a speculative \u201cbubble\u201d in which prices appear to depart from any semblance of intrinsic value. Bubbles seem to arise when a rapid run-up in prices creates a widespread expecta-tion that they will continue to rise. As more and more investors try to get in on the action, they push prices even further. Inevitably, however, the run-up stalls and the bubble ends in a crash. \n Less than a century after tulip mania, the South Sea Bubble in England became almost \nas famous. In this episode, the share price of the South Sea Company rose from \u00a3128 in January 1720 to \u00a3550 in May, and peaked at around \u00a31,000 in August\u2014just before the bubble burst and the share price collapsed to \u00a3150 in September, leading to widespread bankruptcies among those who had borrowed to buy shares on credit. In fact, the company was a major lender of money to investors willing to buy (and thus bid up) its shares. This sequence may sound familiar to anyone who lived through the dot-com boom and bust of 1995\u20132002  \n45   or, more recently, the financial turmoil of 2008, with origins widely attrib-\nuted to a collapsing housing price bubble.  \n It is hard to defend the position that security prices in these instances represented ratio-\nnal, unbiased assessments of intrinsic value. And in fact, some economists, most notably Hyman Minsky, have suggested that bubbles arise naturally. During periods of stability and rising prices, investors extrapolate that stability into the future and become more will-ing to take on risk. Risk premiums shrink, leading to further increases in asset prices, and expectations become even more optimistic in a self-fulfilling cycle. But in the end, pricing and risk taking become excessive and the bubble bursts. Ironically, the initial period of stability fosters behavior that ultimately results in instability. \n But beware of jumping to the conclusion that asset prices may generally be thought of \nas arbitrary and obvious trading opportunities abundant. First, most bubbles become \u201cobvi-ous\u201d only in retrospect. At the time, the price run-up often seems to have a defensible ratio-nale. In the dot-com boom, for example, many contemporary observers rationalized stock \n  44 About a third of that decay occurs between the final date of the sample and the publication date, which the \nauthors note may reflect the portion of apparent abnormal returns that actually are due to data mining. The \nremaining decay would then be attributable to the actions of sophisticated investors whose trades move anoma-lous prices back toward intrinsic value. \n  \n45 The dot-com boom gave rise to the term irrational exuberance. In this vein, consider that one company going \npublic in the investment boom of 1720 described itself simply as \u201ca company for carrying out an undertaking of \ngreat advantage, but nobody to know what it is.\u201d \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   374bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   374 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 11 The Efficient Market Hypothesis 375\nprice gains as justified by the prospect of a new and more profitable economy, driven by \ntechnological advances. Even the irrationality of the tulip mania may have been overblown in its later retelling.  \n46   In addition, security valuation is intrinsically difficult. Given the \nconsiderable imprecision of estimates of intrinsic value, large bets on perceived mispricing may entail hubris.\n  \n Moreover, even if you suspect that prices are in fact \u201cwrong,\u201d taking advantage of them \ncan be difficult. We explore these issues in more detail in the following chapter, but for now, we simply point out some impediments to making aggressive bets against an asset, among them, the costs of short selling overpriced securities as well as potential problems obtaining the securities to sell short, and the possibility that even if you are ultimately correct, the market may disagree and prices still can move dramatically against you in the short term, thus wiping out your portfolio.    \n  46 For interesting discussions of this possibility, see Peter Garber, Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of \nEarly Manias (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000), and Anne Goldgar, Tulipmania: Money, Honor, and Knowledge in \nthe Dutch Golden Age (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007). \n  47 This problem may be less severe in the future; one recent reform intended to mitigate the conflict of interest in \nhaving brokerage firms that sell stocks also provide investment advice is to separate analyst coverage from the \nother activities of the firm. \n  48 B.

Womack, \u201cDo Brokerage Analysts\u2019 Recommendations Have Investment Value?\u201d Journal of Finance 51 \n(March 1996), pp. 137\u201367.   We have documented some of the apparent chinks in the armor of efficient market propo-\nnents. For investors, the issue of market efficiency boils down to whether skilled investors can make consistent abnormal trading profits. The best test is to look at the performance of market professionals to see if they can generate performance superior to that of a pas-sive index fund that buys and holds the market. We will look at two facets of professional performance: that of stock market analysts who recommend investment positions and that of mutual fund managers who actually manage portfolios.  \n   Stock Market Analysts \n Stock market analysts historically have worked for brokerage firms, which presents an immediate problem in interpreting the value of their advice: Analysts have tended to be overwhelmingly positive in their assessment of the prospects of firms.  \n47   For example, on \na scale of 1 (strong buy) to 5 (strong sell), the average recommendation for 5,628 cov-ered firms in 1996 was 2.04.  \n48   As a result, we cannot take positive recommendations \n(e.g., to buy) at face value. Instead, we must look at either the relative enthusiasm of ana-lyst recommendations compared to those for other firms, or at the change in consensus recommendations.\n \n Womack  49   focuses on changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations and finds that positive \nchanges are associated with increased stock prices of about 5%, and negative changes result in average price decreases of 11%. One might wonder whether these price changes reflect the market\u2019s recognition of analysts\u2019 superior information or insight about firms or, instead, simply result from new buy or sell pressure brought on by the recommenda-tions themselves. Womack argues that price impact seems to be permanent, and therefore    11.5 Mutual Fund and Analyst Performance \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   375bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   375 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n376 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nconsistent with the hypothesis that analysts do in fact reveal new information. Jegadeesh, \nKim, Krische, and Lee  50   also find that changes in consensus recommendations are associ-\nated with price changes, but that the  level  of consensus recommendations is an inconsistent \npredictor of future stock performance.   \n Barber, Lehavy, McNichols, and Trueman  51   focus on the level of consensus recom-\nmendations and show that firms with the most-favorable recommendations outperform those with the least-favorable recommendations. While their results seem impressive, the authors note that portfolio strategies based on analyst consensus recommendations would result in extremely heavy trading activity with associated costs that probably would wipe out the potential profits from the strategy.\n \n In sum, the literature suggests some value is added by analysts, but ambiguity remains. \nAre superior returns following analyst upgrades due to revelation of new information or due to changes in investor demand in response to the changed outlook? Also, are these results exploitable by investors who necessarily incur trading costs?  \n  Mutual Fund Managers \n As we pointed out in Chapter 4, casual evidence does not support the claim that profes-sionally managed portfolios can consistently beat the market. Figure 4.2 in that chapter demonstrated that between 1972 and 2011 the returns of a passive portfolio indexed to the Wilshire 5000 typically would have been better than those of the average equity fund. On the other hand, there was some (admittedly inconsistent) evidence of persistence in per-formance, meaning that the better managers in one period tended to be better managers in following periods. Such a pattern would suggest that the better managers can with some consistency outperform their competitors, and it would be inconsistent with the notion that market prices already reflect all relevant information. \n The analyses cited in Chapter 4 were based on total returns; they did not properly adjust \nreturns for exposure to systematic risk factors. In this section we revisit the question of mutual fund performance, paying more attention to the benchmark against which perfor-mance ought to be evaluated. \n As a first pass, we might examine the risk-adjusted returns (i.e., the alpha, or return in \nexcess of required return based on beta and the market-index return in each period) of a large sample of mutual funds. But the market index may not be an adequate benchmark against which to evaluate mutual fund returns. Because mutual funds tend to maintain con-siderable holdings in equity of small firms, whereas the capitalization-weighted index is dominated by large firms, mutual funds as a whole will tend to outperform the index when small firms outperform large ones and underperform when small firms fare worse. Thus a better benchmark for the performance of funds would be an index that separately incorpo-rates the stock market performance of smaller firms. \n The importance of the benchmark can be illustrated by examining the returns on small \nstocks in various subperiods.  \n52   In the 20-year period between 1945 and 1964, for example, \na small-stock index underperformed the S&P 500 by about 4% per year (i.e., the alpha of the small-stock index after adjusting for systematic risk was 24%). In the following 20-year period between 1965 and 1984, small stocks outperformed the S&P index by 10%. \n  50 N. Jegadeesh, J. Kim, S. D. Krische, and C. M.

In the later period, funds would look better on a risk-adjusted basis rela-\ntive to the S&P 500 because small stocks performed better. The \u201cstyle choice,\u201d that is, the \nexposure to small stocks (which is an asset allocation decision) would dominate the evalu-\nation of performance even though it has little to do with managers\u2019 stock-picking ability.  53    \n The conventional performance benchmark today is a four-factor model, which employs \nthe three Fama-French factors (the return on the market index, and returns to portfolios \nbased on size and book-to-market ratio) augmented by a momentum factor (a portfolio \nconstructed based on prior-year stock return). Alphas constructed using an expanded index \nmodel using these four factors control for a wide range of mutual fund style choices that \nmay affect average returns, for example, an inclination to growth versus value or small- \nversus large-capitalization stocks.  Figure\u00a0 11.7  shows a frequency distribution of four-\nfactor alphas for U.S. domestic equity funds.  54   The results show that the distribution of \nalpha is roughly bell shaped, with a slightly negative mean. On average, it does not appear \nthat these funds outperform their style-adjusted benchmarks.   \n Consistent with  Figure\u00a011.7 , Fama and French  55   use the four-factor model to assess the \nperformance of equity mutual funds and show that, while they may exhibit positive alphas \n53 Remember that the asset allocation decision is usually in the hands of the individual investor. Investors allocate \ntheir investment portfolios to funds in asset classes they desire to hold, and they can reasonably expect only that \nmutual fund portfolio managers will choose stocks advantageously  within   those asset classes. \n54 We are grateful to Professor Richard Evans for these data. \n55 Eugene F.

Likewise, \nWermers,  56   who uses both style portfolios as well as the characteristics of the stocks held \nby mutual funds to control for performance, also finds positive gross alphas but negative \nnet alphas after controlling for fees and risk.  \n Carhart  57   reexamines the issue of consistency in mutual fund performance and finds \nthat, after controlling for these factors, there is only minor persistence in relative perfor-\nmance across managers. Moreover, much of that persistence seems due to expenses and \ntransactions costs rather than gross investment returns.  \n However, Bollen and Busse  58   do find evidence of performance persistence, at least over \nshort horizons. They rank mutual fund performance using the four-factor model over a \nbase quarter, assign funds into one of ten deciles according to base-period alpha, and then \nlook at performance in the following quarter.  Figure\u00a011.8  illustrates their results. The solid \nline is the average alpha of funds within each of the deciles in the base period (expressed \non a quarterly basis). The steepness of that curve reflects the considerable dispersion in \nperformance in the ranking period. The dashed line is the average performance of the funds \nin each decile in the following quarter. The shallowness of this curve indicates that most \nof the original performance differential disappears. Nevertheless, the plot is still clearly \ndownward sloping, so it appears that, at least over a short horizon such as one quarter, \nthere is some performance consistency. However, that persistence is probably too small a \nfraction of the original performance differential to justify performance chasing by mutual \nfund customers.\nQuarterly Return (%)\u22122\n\u22124\n\u2212606\n4\n2\nPerformance Decile in Ranking QuarterRanking Quarter Post-Ranking Quarter\n123456789 1 0\n Figure 11.8 Risk-adjusted performance in ranking quarter and following quarter  \n56 R.

Thus, skill will show up not in superior returns, but rather in the amount of funds under management. Therefore, even if managers are skilled, alphas will be short-lived, as they seem to be in Figure\u00a011.8     .\n  \n Del Guercio and Reuter  60   offer a finer interpretation of mutual fund performance and \nthe Berk and Green hypothesis. They split mutual fund investors into those who buy funds directly for themselves versus those who purchase funds through brokers, reasoning that the direct-sold segment may be more financially literate while the broker-sold segment is less comfortable making financial decisions without professional advice. Consistent with this hypothesis, they show that direct-sold investors direct their assets to funds with posi-tive alphas (consistent with the Berk-Green model), but broker-sold investors generally do not. This provides a greater incentive for direct-sold funds to invest relatively more in alpha-generating inputs such as talented portfolio managers or analysts. Moreover, they show that the after-fee performance of direct-sold funds is as good as that of index funds (again, consis-tent with Berk-Green), while the performance of broker-sold funds is considerably worse. It thus appears that the average underperformance of actively managed mutual funds is driven largely by broker-sold funds and that this underperformance may be interpreted as an implicit cost that less informed investors pay for the advice they get from their brokers.\n \n In contrast to the extensive studies of equity fund managers, there have been few studies \nof the performance of bond fund managers. Blake, Elton, and Gruber  61   examined the per-\nformance of fixed-income mutual funds. They found that, on average, bond funds under-perform passive fixed-income indexes by an amount roughly equal to expenses, and that there is no evidence that past performance can predict future performance. More recently, Chen, Ferson, and Peters (2010) find that on average, bond mutual funds outperform pas-sive bond indexes in terms of gross returns but underperform once the fees they charge their investors are subtracted, a result similar to those others have found for equity funds.\n \n Thus the evidence on the risk-adjusted performance of professional managers is mixed \nat best. We conclude that the performance of professional managers is broadly consistent with market efficiency. The amounts by which professional managers as a group beat or are beaten by the market fall within the margin of statistical uncertainty. In any event, it is quite clear that performance superior to passive strategies is far from routine. Studies show either that most managers cannot outperform passive strategies or that if there is a margin of superiority, it is small. \n On the other hand, a small number of investment superstars\u2014Peter Lynch (formerly of \nFidelity\u2019s Magellan Fund), Warren Buffett (of Berkshire Hathaway), John Templeton (of Templeton Funds), and Mario Gabelli (of GAMCO) among them\u2014have compiled career records that show a consistency of superior performance hard to reconcile with abso-lutely efficient markets.

However, Nobel Prize\u2013winner Paul Samuelson  63   reviewed this investment \nhall of fame and pointed out that the records of the vast majority of professional money managers offer convincing evidence that there are no easy strategies to guarantee success in the securities markets.   \n  So, Are Markets Efficient? \n There is a telling joke about two economists walking down the street. They spot a $20 bill on the sidewalk. One stoops to pick it up, but the other one says, \u201cDon\u2019t bother; if the bill were real someone would have picked it up already.\u201d \n The lesson is clear. An overly doctrinaire belief in efficient markets can paralyze the \ninvestor and make it appear that no research effort can be justified. This extreme view is probably unwarranted. There are enough anomalies in the empirical evidence to justify the search for underpriced securities that clearly goes on. \n The bulk of the evidence, however, suggests that any supposedly superior investment \nstrategy should be taken with many grains of salt. The market is competitive  enough  that \nonly differentially superior information or insight will earn money; the easy pickings have been picked. In the end it is likely that the margin of superiority that any professional man-ager can add is so slight that the statistician will not easily be able to detect it. \n We conclude that markets are generally very efficient, but that rewards to the especially \ndiligent, intelligent, or creative may in fact be waiting.     \n  63 Paul Samuelson, \u201cThe Judgment of Economic Science on Rational Portfolio Management,\u201d Journal of Portfolio \nManagement 16 (Fall 1989), pp. 4\u201312. \n     1 .   Statistical research has shown that to a close approximation stock prices seem to follow a random \nwalk with no discernible predictable patterns that investors can exploit. Such findings are now taken to be evidence of market efficiency, that is, evidence that market prices reflect all cur-rently available information. Only new information will move stock prices, and this information is equally likely to be good news or bad news.  \n    2 .   Market participants distinguish among three forms of the efficient market hypothesis. The weak form asserts that all information to be derived from past trading data already is reflected in stock prices. The semistrong form claims that all publicly available information is already reflected. The strong form, which generally is acknowledged to be extreme, asserts that all information, including insider information, is reflected in prices.  \n    3 .   Technical analysis focuses on stock price patterns and on proxies for buy or sell pressure in the market. Fundamental analysis focuses on the determinants of the underlying value of the firm, such as current profitability and growth prospects. Because both types of analysis are based on public information, neither should generate excess profits if markets are operating efficiently.  \n    4 .   Proponents of the efficient market hypothesis often advocate passive as opposed to active invest-ment strategies. The policy of passive investors is to buy and hold a broad-based market index. They expend resources neither on market research nor on frequent purchase and sale of stocks. Passive strategies may be tailored to meet individual investor requirements.  \n    5 .   Event studies are used to evaluate the economic impact of events of interest, using abnormal stock returns. Such studies usually show that there is some leakage of inside information to some market participants before the public announcement date. Therefore, insiders do seem to be able to exploit their access to information to at least a limited extent.

Empirical studies of technical analysis do not generally support the hypothesis that such analysis \ncan generate superior trading profits. One notable exception to this conclusion is the apparent success of momentum-based strategies over intermediate-term horizons.  \n    7 .   Several anomalies regarding fundamental analysis have been uncovered. These include the P/E effect, the small-firm-in-January effect, the neglected-firm effect, post\u2013earnings-announcement price drift, and the book-to-market effect. Whether these anomalies represent market inefficiency or poorly understood risk premiums is still a matter of debate.  \n    8 .   By and large, the performance record of professionally managed funds lends little credence to claims that most professionals can consistently beat the market.

If the original value of AmbChaser equity were $100 million, what would you guess was the \nrate of return of its stock this month?  \n    b.

The market today responded to very encouraging news about the \nunemployment rate, and  r   M  \u00a0 5 \u00a03%. The historical relationship between returns on these stocks \nand the market portfolio has been estimated from index model regressions as:   \nApex: r A 5 .2% 1 1.4r M\nBpex: r B 5 2.1% 1 .6r M  \n   On the basis of these data, which company do you think won the lawsuit?  \n   21. Investors  expect  the market rate of return in the coming year to be 12%. The T-bill rate is 4%. \nChanging Fortunes Industries\u2019 stock has a beta of .5. The market value of its outstanding equity \nis $100 million. \n     a.  What is your best guess currently as to the expected rate of return on Changing Fortunes\u2019 \nstock? You believe that the stock is fairly priced.  \n    b.  If the market return in the coming year actually turns out to be 10%, what is your best guess \nas to the rate of return that will be earned on Changing Fortunes\u2019 stock?  \n    c.  Suppose now that Changing Fortunes wins a major lawsuit during the year. The settlement is \n$5 million. Changing Fortunes\u2019 stock return during the year turns out to be 10%. What is your \nbest guess as to the settlement the market previously  expected  Changing Fortunes to receive \nfrom the lawsuit? (Continue to assume that the market return in the year turned out to be 10%.) The magnitude of the settlement is the only unexpected firm-specific event during the year.    \n   22. Dollar-cost averaging means that you buy equal dollar amounts of a stock every period, for \nexample, $500 per month. The strategy is based on the idea that when the stock price is low, your fixed monthly purchase will buy more shares, and when the price is high, fewer shares. Averaging over time, you will end up buying more shares when the stock is cheaper and fewer when it is relatively expensive. Therefore, by design, you will exhibit good market timing. Eval-uate this strategy.  \n   23.

She is particularly interested in the question of whether active managers can be expected to consistently exploit inefficiencies in the capital markets to produce above-average returns without assuming higher risk. \n The semistrong form of the efficient market hypothesis asserts that all publicly available \ninformation is rapidly and correctly reflected in securities prices. This implies that investors cannot expect to derive above-average profits from purchases made after information has become public because security prices already reflect the information\u2019s full effects. \n     a.

Price\u2013earnings ratio.  \n   iii. Market capitalization (size).  \n   iv. Price\u2013cash flow ratio (i.e., market capitalization/operating cash flow).     v. Another criterion that interests you.    \n   You can \ufb01  nd this information by choosing a company and then clicking on  Key Sta-\ntistics.  Rank the \ufb01  rms based on each of the criteria separately, and divide the \ufb01  rms \ninto \ufb01  ve groups based on their ranking for each criterion. Calculate the average \nrate of return for each group of \ufb01  rms. \n   Do you con\ufb01  rm or reject any of the anomalies cited in this chapter? Can you uncover a new anomaly? Note: For your test to be valid, you must form your port-folios based on criteria observed at the  beginning  of the period. Why?  \n   b. Use the price history from the  Historical Prices  tab to calculate the beta of each of \nthe \ufb01  rms in part ( a ). Use this beta, the T-bill rate, and the return on the S&P 500 to \ncalculate the risk-adjusted abnormal return of each stock group. Does any anomaly uncovered in the previous question persist after controlling for risk?  \n   c. Now form stock groups that use two criteria simultaneously. For example, form a \nportfolio of stocks that are both in the lowest quintile of price\u2013earnings ratio and in the highest quintile of book-to-market ratio. Does selecting stocks based on more than one characteristic improve your ability to devise portfolios with abnor-mal returns? Repeat the analysis by forming groups that meet three criteria simul-taneously. Does this yield any further improvement in abnormal returns?     \n   2.

A high-level manager might well have private information about the firm. Her ability to \ntrade profitably on that information is not surprising. This ability does not violate weak-form \nefficiency: The abnormal profits are not derived from an analysis of past price and trading data. If they were, this would indicate that there is valuable information that can be gleaned from such analysis. But this ability does violate strong-form efficiency. Apparently, there is some private information that is not already reflected in stock prices.  \n   b .   The information sets that pertain to the weak, semistrong, and strong form of the EMH can be \ndescribed by the following illustration:     \nStrong-\nform\nsetSemistrong-\nform\nsetWeak-\nform\nset\n   The weak-form information set includes only the history of prices and volumes. The semistrong-\nform set includes the weak form set  plus  all publicly available information. In turn, the strong-form \nset includes the semistrong set  plus  insiders\u2019 information. It is illegal to act on this incremental \ninformation (insiders\u2019 private information). The direction of  valid  implication is   \nStrong-form EMH 1 Semistrong-form EMH 1 Weak-form EMH  \n   The reverse direction implication is  not  valid. For example, stock prices may reflect all past price \ndata (weak-form efficiency) but may not reflect relevant fundamental data (semistrong-form inefficiency).     \n   2. The point made in the preceding discussion is that the very fact that we observe stock prices near \nso-called resistance levels belies the assumption that the price can be a resistance level. If a stock is observed to sell  at any price,  then investors must believe that a fair rate of return can be earned \nif the stock is purchased at that price. It is logically impossible for a stock to have a resistance level  and  offer a fair rate of return at prices just below the resistance level. If we accept that prices \nare appropriate, we must reject any presumption concerning resistance levels.  \n   3. If  everyone  follows a passive strategy, sooner or later prices will fail to reflect new information. \nAt this point there are profit opportunities for active investors who uncover mispriced securities. As they buy and sell these assets, prices again will be driven to fair levels.  \n   4. Predictably declining CARs do violate the EMH. If one can predict such a phenomenon, a profit \nopportunity emerges: Sell (or short sell) the affected stocks on an event date just before their prices are predicted to fall.  \n   5. The answer depends on your prior beliefs about market efficiency. Miller\u2019s record through 2005 was \nincredibly strong. On the other hand, with so many funds in existence, it is less surprising that  some   \nfund would appear to be consistently superior after the fact. Exceptional past performance of a small number of managers is possible by chance even in an efficient market. A better test is provided in \u201ccontinuation studies.\u201d Are better performers in one period more likely to repeat that performance in later periods? Miller\u2019s record after 2005 fails the continuation or consistency criterion.              \nbod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   387bod61671_ch11_349-387.indd   387 7/17/13   3:41 PM7/17/13   3:41 PMFinal PDF to printer\n12 1\n  THE EFFICIENT MARKET\u00a0 hypothesis makes \ntwo important predictions. First, it implies \nthat security prices properly reflect whatever information is available to investors. A second implication follows immediately: Active trad-ers will find it difficult to outperform passive strategies such as holding market indexes. To do so would require differential insight; this in a highly competitive market is very hard to come by. \n Unfortunately, it is hard to devise measures \nof the \u201ctrue\u201d or intrinsic value of a security, \nand correspondingly difficult to test directly whether prices match those values. Therefore, most tests of market efficiency have focused on the performance of active trading strate-gies. These tests have been of two kinds. The anomalies literature has examined strate-gies that apparently  would  have provided \nsuperior risk-adjusted returns (e.g., investing in stocks with momentum or in value rather than glamour stocks). Other tests have looked at the results of  actual  investments by asking \nwhether professional managers have been able to beat the market. \n Neither class of tests has proven fully con-\nclusive. The anomalies literature suggests \nthat several strategies would have provided superior returns. But there are questions as to whether some of these apparent anomalies reflect risk premiums not captured by simple models of risk and return, or even if they merely reflect data mining. Moreover, the apparent inability of the typical money man-ager to turn these anomalies into superior returns on actual portfolios casts additional doubt on their \u201creality.\u201d \n A relatively new school of thought,  behav-\nioral finance,  argues that the sprawling litera-\nture on trading strategies has missed a larger \nand more important point by overlooking the first implication of efficient markets\u2014the correctness of security prices. This may be the more important implication, because market economies rely on prices to allocate resources efficiently. The behavioral school argues that even if security prices are wrong, to exploit them still can be difficult and, therefore, the failure to uncover obviously successful trad-ing rules or traders cannot be taken as proof of market efficiency. \n Whereas conventional theories presume \nthat investors are rational, behavioral finance \nstarts with the assumption that they are not. We will examine some of the information-processing and behavioral irrationalities uncovered by psychologists in other contexts and show how these tendencies applied to financial markets might result in some of the anomalies discussed in the previous  chapter.

If the limits to such arbi-trage activity are severe, mispricing can  survive \neven if some rational investors attempt to exploit it. We turn next to technical analysis and show how behavioral models give some sup-port to techniques that clearly would be use-less in efficient markets. We close the chapter with a brief survey of some of these technical strategies.  \n    12.1 The Behavioral Critique  \n The premise of    behavioral finance    is that conventional financial theory ignores how real \npeople make decisions and that people make a difference.  1   A growing number of econ-\nomists have come to interpret the anomalies literature as consistent with several \u201cirra-\ntionalities\u201d that seem to characterize individuals making complicated decisions. These irrationalities fall into two broad categories: first, that investors do not always process information correctly and therefore infer incorrect probability distributions about future rates of return; and second, that even given a probability distribution of returns, they often make inconsistent or systematically suboptimal decisions.  \n Of course, the existence of irrational investors would not by itself be sufficient to render \ncapital markets inefficient. If such irrationalities did affect prices, then sharp-eyed arbitra-geurs taking advantage of profit opportunities might be expected to push prices back to their proper values. Thus, the second leg of the behavioral critique is that in practice the actions of such arbitrageurs are limited and therefore insufficient to force prices to match intrinsic value. \n This leg of the argument is important. Virtually everyone agrees that if prices are right \n(i.e., price\u00a0 5 \u00a0intrinsic value), then there are no easy profit opportunities. But the reverse is \nnot necessarily true. If behaviorists are correct about limits to arbitrage activity, then the absence of profit opportunities does not necessarily imply that markets are efficient. We\u2019ve noted that most tests of the efficient market hypothesis have focused on the existence of profit opportunities, often as reflected in the performance of money managers. But their failure to systematically outperform passive investment strategies need not imply that mar-kets are in fact efficient. \n We will start our summary of the behavioral critique with the first leg of the argument, \nsurveying a sample of the informational processing errors uncovered by psychologists in other areas. We next examine a few of the behavioral irrationalities that seem to character-ize decision makers. Finally, we look at limits to arbitrage activity, and conclude with a tentative assessment of the import of the behavioral debate.  \n   Information Processing \n Errors in information processing can lead investors to misestimate the true probabilities of possible events or associated rates of return. Several such biases have been uncovered. Here are four of the more important ones. \n  1 The discussion in this section is largely based on Nicholas Barberis and Richard Thaler, \u201cA Survey of  Behavioral \nFinance,\u201d in the  Handbook of the Economics of Finance,  eds. G. M. Constantinides, M. Harris, and R. Stulz \n(Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2003). \nbod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   389bod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   389 7/17/13   3:46 PM7/17/13   3:46 PMFinal PDF to printer\n390 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n  Forecasting Errors   A series of experiments by Kahneman and Tversky  2   indicate that \npeople give too much weight to recent experience compared to prior beliefs when mak-\ning forecasts (sometimes dubbed a  memory bias ) and tend to make forecasts that are too \nextreme given the uncertainty inherent in their information. DeBondt and Thaler  3   argue \nthat the P/E effect can be explained by earnings expectations that are too extreme. In this view, when forecasts of a firm\u2019s future earnings are high, perhaps due to favorable recent performance, they tend to be  too  high relative to the objective prospects of the firm. This \nresults in a high initial P/E (due to the excessive optimism built into the stock price) and poor subsequent performance when investors recognize their error. Thus, high P/E firms tend to be poor investments.   \n  Overconfidence   People tend to overestimate the precision of their beliefs or fore-\ncasts, and they tend to overestimate their abilities. In one famous survey, 90% of drivers \nin Sweden ranked themselves as better-than-average drivers. Such overconfidence may be responsible for the prevalence of active versus passive investment management\u2014itself an anomaly to adherents of the efficient market hypothesis. Despite the growing popularity of indexing, only about 15% of the equity in the mutual fund industry is held in indexed accounts. The dominance of active management in the face of the typical underperfor-mance of such strategies (consider the generally disappointing performance of actively managed mutual funds reviewed in Chapter 4 as well as in the previous chapter) is consis-tent with a tendency to overestimate ability. \n An interesting example of overconfidence in financial markets is provided by Barber \nand Odean,  \n4   who compare trading activity and average returns in brokerage accounts of \nmen and women. They find that men (in particular, single men) trade far more actively than women, consistent with the generally greater overconfidence among men well documented in the psychology literature. They also find that trading activity is highly predictive of poor investment performance. The top 20% of accounts ranked by portfolio turnover had average returns 7 percentage points lower than the 20% of the accounts with the lowest turnover rates. As they conclude, \u201ctrading [and by implication, overconfidence] is hazard-ous to your wealth.\u201d \n Overconfidence appears to be a widespread phenomenon, also showing up in many \ncorporate finance contexts. For example, overconfident CEOs are more likely to over-pay for target firms when making corporate acquisitions.  \n5   Just as overconfidence can \ndegrade portfolio investments, it also can lead such firms to make poor investments in real assets.  \n  Conservatism   A    conservatism    bias means that investors are too slow (too conserva-\ntive) in updating their beliefs in response to new evidence. This means that they might \ninitially underreact to news about a firm, so that prices will fully reflect new information only gradually. Such a bias would give rise to momentum in stock market returns.  \n  2 D. Kahneman and A.

They may there-\nfore infer a pattern too quickly based on a small sample and extrapolate apparent trends too far into the future. It is easy to see how such a pattern would be consistent with over-reaction and correction anomalies. A short-lived run of good earnings reports or high stock returns would lead such investors to revise their assessments of likely future performance, and thus generate buying pressure that exaggerates the price run-up. Eventually, the gap between price and intrinsic value becomes glaring and the market corrects its initial error. Interestingly, stocks with the best recent performance suffer reversals precisely in the few days surrounding earnings announcements, suggesting that the correction occurs just as investors learn that their initial beliefs were too extreme.  \n6       \n  6 N. Chopra, J. Lakonishok, and J. Ritter, \u201cMeasuring Abnormal Performance: Do Stocks Overreact?\u201d  Journal of \nFinancial Economics  31 (1992), pp. 235\u201368.  We saw in the previous chapter that stocks seem to exhibit a pattern of short- to middle-term momentum, \nalong with long-term reversals. How might this pattern arise from an interplay between the conservatism and representativeness biases?  CONCEPT CHECK 12.1 \n  Behavioral Biases \n Even if information processing were perfect, many studies conclude that individuals would \ntend to make less-than-fully-rational decisions using that information. These behavioral biases largely affect how investors frame questions of risk versus return, and therefore make risk\u2013return trade-offs. \n  Framing   Decisions seem to be affected by how choices are    framed    .  For example, an \nindividual may reject a bet when it is posed in terms of the risk surrounding possible gains \nbut may accept that same bet when described in terms of the risk surrounding potential losses. In other words, individuals may act risk averse in terms of gains but risk seeking in terms of losses. But in many cases, the choice of how to frame a risky venture\u2014as involv-ing gains or losses\u2014can be arbitrary.   \n Consider a coin toss with a payoff of $50 for tails. Now consider a gift of $50 that is \nbundled with a bet that imposes a loss of $50 if that coin toss comes up heads. In both cases, you end up with zero for heads and $50 for tails. But the former description frames the coin toss as posing a risky gain while the latter frames the coin toss in terms of risky losses. The difference in framing can lead to different attitudes toward the bet.  Example 12.1 Framing \n  Mental Accounting      Mental accounting    is a specific form of framing in which \n people segregate certain decisions. For example, an investor may take a lot of risk with one \ninvestment account but establish a very conservative position with another account that is dedicated to her child\u2019s education. Rationally, it might be better to view both accounts as \nbod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   391bod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   391 7/17/13   3:46 PM7/17/13   3:46 PMFinal PDF to printer\n392 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\npart of the investor\u2019s overall portfolio with the risk\u2013return profiles of each integrated into \na unified framework. Nevertheless, Statman  7   points out that a central distinction between \nconventional and behavioral finance theory is that the behavioral approach views inves-tors as building their portfolios in \u201cdistinct mental account layers in a pyramid of assets,\u201d where each layer may be tied to particular goals and elicit different levels of risk aversion.\nIn another paper, Statman  \n8   argues that mental accounting is consistent with some inves-\ntors\u2019 irrational preference for stocks with high cash dividends (they feel free to spend divi-dend income, but would not \u201cdip into capital\u201d by selling a few shares of another stock with the same total rate of return) and with a tendency to ride losing stock positions for too long (because \u201cbehavioral investors\u201d are reluctant to realize losses). In fact, investors are more likely to sell stocks with gains than those with losses, precisely contrary to a tax-minimization strategy.  \n9    \n Mental accounting effects also can help explain momentum in stock prices. The  house \nmoney effect  refers to gamblers\u2019 greater willingness to accept new bets if they currently are ahead. They think of (i.e., frame) the bet as being made with their \u201cwinnings account,\u201d that is, with the casino\u2019s and not with their own money, and thus are more willing to accept risk. Analogously, after a stock market run-up, individuals may view investments as largely funded out of a \u201ccapital gains account,\u201d become more tolerant of risk, discount future cash flows at a lower rate, and thus further push up prices.  \n  Regret Avoidance   Psychologists have found that individuals who make decisions \nthat turn out badly have more regret (blame themselves more) when that decision was \nmore unconventional. For example, buying a blue-chip portfolio that turns down is not as painful as experiencing the same losses on an unknown start-up firm. Any losses on the blue-chip stocks can be more easily attributed to bad luck rather than bad decision making and cause less regret. De Bondt and Thaler  \n10   argue that such    regret avoidance    \nis consistent with both the size and book-to-market effect. Higher book-to-market firms tend to have depressed stock prices. These firms are \u201cout of favor\u201d and more likely to be in a financially precarious position. Similarly, smaller, less well known firms are also less conventional investments. Such firms require more \u201ccourage\u201d on the part of the inves-\ntor, which increases the required rate of return. Mental accounting can add to this effect. If investors focus on the gains or losses of individual stocks, rather than on broad portfolios, they can become more risk averse con-cerning stocks with recent poor performance, discount their cash flows at a higher rate, and thereby create a value-stock risk premium.    \n  Affect \n Conventional models of portfolio choice focus on asset risk and return. But behavioral finance focuses as well on  affect,   which is a feeling of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d that consumers may \nattach to a potential purchase or investors to a stock. For example, firms with reputations \n  7 Meir Statman, 2008.  Handbook of Finance,  vol. II, Ch 9, \u201cWhat is Behavioral Finance?\u201d ed. Frank J.

If investors favor stocks with \ngood affect, that might drive up prices \nand drive down average rates of return. \nStatman, Fisher, and Anginer  11   looked \nfor evidence that affect influences \nsecurity pricing. They found that \nstocks ranked high in  Fortune\u2019 s   survey \nof most admired companies (i.e., with \nhigh affect) tended to have lower \naverage risk-adjusted returns than the \nleast admired firms, suggesting that \ntheir prices have been bid up relative \nto their underlying profitability, and \ntherefore, that their expected future \nreturns are lower.  \n  Prospect Theory      Prospect theory    \nmodifies the analytic description of ratio-\nnal risk-averse investors found in stan-\ndard financial theory.  12    Figure\u00a0 12.1 , \npanel A, illustrates the conventional \ndescription of a risk-averse investor. \nHigher wealth provides higher sat-\nisfaction, or \u201cutility,\u201d but at a dimin-\nishing rate (the curve flattens as the \nindividual becomes wealthier).

Moreover, the convex curvature to the left of the origin in panel B will induce investors to be risk seeking rather than risk averse when it comes to losses. Consistent with loss aversion, traders in the T-bond futures contract have been observed to assume significantly greater risk in afternoon sessions following morning sessions in which they have lost money.  \n13     \n These are only a sample of many behavioral biases uncovered in the literature. Many \nhave implications for investor behavior. The nearby box offers some good examples.   \n  Limits to Arbitrage \n Behavioral biases would not matter for stock pricing if rational arbitrageurs could fully exploit the mistakes of behavioral investors. Trades of profit-seeking investors would cor-rect any misalignment of prices. However, behavioral advocates argue that in practice, several factors limit the ability to profit from mispricing.  \n14   \n  Fundamental Risk   Suppose that a share of IBM is underpriced. Buying it may pre-\nsent a profit opportunity, but it is hardly risk-free, because the presumed market under-\npricing can get worse. While price eventually should converge to intrinsic value, this may not happen until after the trader\u2019s investment horizon. For example, the investor may be a mutual fund manager who may lose clients (not to mention a job!) if short-term per-formance is poor, or a trader who may run through her capital if the market turns against her, even temporarily. A comment often attributed to the famous economist John Maynard Keynes is that \u201cmarkets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\u201d The    fundamental risk    incurred in exploiting apparent profit opportunities presumably will \nlimit the activity of traders.    \n  13 J.

From that perspec-\ntive, the value the index had reached in 2000, around 5,000, seemed obviously crazy. Surely some investors living through the Internet \u201cbubble\u201d of the late 1990s must have identified the index as grossly overvalued, suggesting a good selling opportunity. But this hardly would have been a riskless arbitrage opportunity. Consider that NASDAQ may also have been overvalued in 1999 when it first crossed above 3,500 (20% higher than its value in 2012). An investor in 1999 who believed (as it turns out, quite correctly) that NASDAQ was overvalued at 3,500 and decided to sell it short would have suffered enormous losses as the index increased by another 1,500 points before finally peaking at 5,000. While the investor might have derived considerable satisfaction at eventually being proven right about the overpricing, by entering a year before the market \u201ccor-rected,\u201d he might also have gone broke.

Short-\nselling a security entails costs; short-sellers may have to return the borrowed security on \nlittle notice, rendering the horizon of the short sale uncertain; other investors such as many pension or mutual fund managers face strict limits on their discretion to short securities. This can limit the ability of arbitrage activity to force prices to fair value.  \n  Model Risk   One always has to worry that an apparent profit opportunity is more \napparent than real. Perhaps you are using a faulty model to value the security, and the \nprice actually is right. Mispricing may make a position a good bet, but it is still a risky one, which limits the extent to which it will be pursued.   \n  Limits to Arbitrage and the Law of One Price \n While one can debate the implications of much of the anomalies literature, surely the Law of One Price (positing that effectively identical assets should have identical prices) should be satisfied in rational markets. Yet there are several instances where the law seems to have been violated. These instances are good case studies of the limits to arbitrage.   Why It\u2019s So Tough to Fix Your Portfolio \n If your portfolio is out of whack, you could ask an invest-\nment adviser for help. But you might have better luck with your therapist. \n It\u2019s a common dilemma: You know you have the wrong \nmix of investments, but you cannot bring yourself to fix \nthe mess. Why is it so difficult to change? At issue are three mental mistakes. \n  CHASING WINNERS \n Looking to lighten up on bonds and get back into stocks? \nSure, you know stocks are a long-term investment and, sure, you know they are best bought when cheap. \n Yet it\u2019s a lot easier to pull the trigger and buy stocks if \nthe market has lately been scoring gains. \u201cPeople are influ-\nenced by what has happened most recently, and then they extrapolate from that,\u201d says Meir Statman, a finance pro-fessor at Santa Clara University in California. \u201cBut often, they end up being optimistic and pessimistic at just the wrong time.\u201d \n Consider some results from the UBS Index of Investor \nOptimism, a monthly poll conducted by UBS and the Gal-\nlup Organization. Each month, the poll asks investors what gain they expect from their portfolio during the next 12 months. Result? You guessed it: The answers rise and fall with the stock market. \n For instance, during the bruising bear market, investors \ngrew increasingly pessimistic, and at the market bottom \nthey were looking for median portfolio gains of just 5%. But true to form, last year\u2019s rally brightened investors\u2019 spir-its and by January they were expecting 10% returns.  \n  GETTING EVEN \n This year\u2019s choppy stock market hasn\u2019t scared off just bond \ninvestors. It has also made it difficult for stock investors to rejigger their portfolios.  Blame it on the old \u201cget even, then get out\u201d syndrome. \nWith stocks treading water, many investors are reluctant \nto sell, because they are a long way from recovering their bear-market losses. To be sure, investors who bought near the peak are underwater, whether they sell or not. But sell-ing losers is still agonizing, because it means admitting you made a mistake. \n \u201cIf you\u2019re rational and you have a loss, you sell, take \nthe tax loss and move on,\u201d Prof. Statman says. \u201cBut if \nyou\u2019re a normal person, selling at a loss tears your heart out.\u201d  \n  MUSTERING COURAGE \n Whether you need to buy stocks or buy bonds, it takes con-\nfidence to act. And right now, investors just aren\u2019t confi-dent. \u201cThere\u2019s this status-quo bias,\u201d says John Nofsinger, a finance professor at Washington State University in Pull-man, Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid to do anything, because we\u2019re afraid we\u2019ll regret it.\u201d \n Once again, it\u2019s driven by recent market action. When \nmarkets are flying high, folks attribute their portfolio\u2019s \ngains to their own brilliance. That gives them the confi-dence to trade more and to take greater risks. Overreacting to short-term market results is, of course, a great way to lose a truckload of money. But with any luck, if you are aware of this pitfall, maybe you will avoid it. \n Or maybe [this is] too optimistic. \u201cYou can tell some-\nbody that investors have all these behavioral biases,\u201d says \nTerrance Odean, a finance professor at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cSo what happens? The investor thinks, \u2018Oh, that sounds like my husband. I don\u2019t think many investors say, \u2018Oh, that sounds like me.\u2019\u201d   \n  Source:  Jonathan Clements,  The Wall Street Journal Online,  \nJune 23, 2004. \u00a9 2004 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The two original companies, which continued \nto trade separately, agreed to split all profits from the joint company on a 60/40 basis. \nShareholders of Royal Dutch receive 60% of the cash flow, and those of Shell receive 40%. \nOne would therefore expect that Royal Dutch should sell for exactly 60/40\u00a0 5 \u00a01.5 times the \nprice of Shell. But this is not the case.  Figure\u00a012.2  shows that the relative value of the two \nfirms has departed considerably from this \u201cparity\u201d ratio for extended periods of time.  \n Doesn\u2019t this mispricing give rise to an arbitrage opportunity? If Royal Dutch sells for \nmore than 1.5 times Shell, why not buy relatively underpriced Shell and short sell over-\npriced Royal? This seems like a reasonable strategy, but if you had followed it in February \n1993 when Royal sold for about 10% more than its parity value,  Figure\u00a012.2  shows that \nyou would have lost a lot of money as the premium widened to about 17% before finally \nreversing after 1999. As in Example 12.2, this opportunity posed fundamental risk.  \n  Equity Carve-Outs   Several equity carve-outs also have violated the Law of One \nPrice.  16   To illustrate, consider the case of 3Com, which in 1999 decided to spin off its Palm \ndivision. It first sold 5% of its stake in Palm in an IPO, announcing that it would distribute \nthe remaining 95% of its Palm shares to 3Com shareholders 6 months later in a spinoff. \nEach 3Com shareholder would receive 1.5 shares of Palm in the spinoff. \n  15 This discussion is based on K.

After all, each share of 3Com entitled its owner \nto 1.5 shares of Palm  plus  an ownership stake in a profitable company. Instead, Palm shares \nat the IPO actually sold for  more  than the 3Com shares. The  stub value  of 3Com (i.e., the \nvalue of each 3Com share net of the value of the claim to Palm represented by that share) \ncould be computed as the price of 3Com minus 1.5 times the price of Palm. This calcula-tion, however, implies that 3Com\u2019s stub value was negative, despite the fact that it was a profitable company with cash assets alone of about $10 per share. \n Again, an arbitrage strategy seems obvious. Why not buy 3Com and sell Palm? The \nlimit to arbitrage in this case was the inability of investors to sell Palm short. Virtually all available shares in Palm were already borrowed and sold short, and the negative stub  values persisted for more than 2 months.  \n  Closed-End Funds   We noted in Chapter 4 that closed-end funds often sell for sub-\nstantial discounts or premiums from net asset value. This is \u201cnearly\u201d a violation of the \nLaw of One Price, because one would expect the value of the fund to equal the value of the shares it holds. We say nearly because, in practice, there are a few wedges between the value of the closed-end fund and its underlying assets. One is expenses. The fund incurs expenses that ultimately are paid for by investors, and these will reduce share price. On the other hand, if managers can invest fund assets to generate positive risk-adjusted returns, share price might exceed net asset value. \n Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler  \n17   argue that the patterns of discounts and premiums on \nclosed-end funds are driven by changes in investor sentiment. They note that discounts on various funds move together and are correlated with the return on small stocks, suggest-ing that all are affected by common variation in sentiment. One might consider buying funds selling at a discount from net asset value and selling those trading at a premium, but discounts and premiums can widen, subjecting this strategy to fundamental risk. Pontiff  \n18   \ndemonstrates that deviations of price from net asset value in closed-end funds tend to be higher in funds that are more difficult to arbitrage, for example, those with more idiosyn-cratic volatility.  \n Closed-end fund discounts are a good example of apparent anomalies that also may \nhave rational explanations. Ross demonstrates that they can be reconciled with rational investors even if expenses or fund abnormal returns are modest.  \n19   He shows that if a fund \nhas a dividend yield of  d , an alpha (risk-adjusted abnormal return) of  a , and expense ratio \nof \u00e1, then using the constant-growth dividend discount model (see Chapter 18), the pre-\nmium of the fund over its net asset value will be\n  Price2NAV\nNAV5a2\u00e1\nd1\u00e12a   \n If the fund manager\u2019s performance more than compensates for expenses (i.e., if  a \u00a0>\u00a0\u00e1), \nthe fund will sell at a premium to NA V; otherwise it will sell at a discount. For example, suppose  a \u00a0 5 \u00a0.015, the expense ratio is \u00e1\u00a0 5 \u00a0.0125, and the dividend yield is  a \u00a0 5 \u00a0.02. Then \nthe premium will be .14, or 14%. But if the market turns sour on the manager and revises its estimate of  a  downward to .005, that premium quickly turns into a discount of 27%. \n  17 C. M. Lee, A. Shleifer, and R. H.

What do you think would happen to a closed-end fund\u2019s discount if the fund announced that it plans to liquidate in 6 months, at which time it will distribute NAV to its shareholders?  CONCEPT CHECK 12.3 \n  Bubbles and Behavioral Economics \n In Example 12.2 above, we pointed out that the stock market run-up of the late 1990s, \nand even more spectacularly, the run-up of the technology-heavy NASDAQ market, seems in retrospect to have been an obvious bubble. In a 6-year period beginning in 1995, the NASDAQ index increased by a factor of more than 6. Former Fed Chairman Alan Green-span famously characterized the dot-com boom as an example of \u201cirrational exuberance,\u201d and his assessment turned out to be correct: by October 2002, the index fell to less than one-fourth the peak value it had reached only 2\u00bd years earlier. This episode seems to be a case in point for advocates of the behavioral school, exemplifying a market moved by irrational investor sentiment. Moreover, in accord with behavioral patterns, as the dot-com boom developed, it seemed to feed on itself, with investors increasingly confident of their investment prowess (overconfidence bias) and apparently willing to extrapolate short-term patterns into the distant future (representativeness bias). \n Only 5 years later, another bubble, this time in housing prices, was under way. As in \nthe dot-com bubble, prospects of further price increases fueled speculative demand by purchasers. Shortly thereafter, of course, housing prices stalled and then fell. The bursting bubble set off the worst financial crisis in 75 years. \n Bubbles are a lot easier to identify as such once they are over. While they are going on, \nit is not as clear that prices are irrationally exuberant and, indeed, many financial commen-tators during the dot-com bubble justified the boom as consistent with glowing forecasts for the \u201cnew economy.\u201d A simple example shows how hard it can be to tie down the fair value of stock investments.  \n21    \n In 2000, near the peak of the dot-com boom, the dividends paid by the firms included in \nthe S&P 500 totaled $154.6 million. If the discount rate for the index was 9.2% and the expected dividend growth rate was 8%, the value of these shares according to the con-stant-growth dividend discount model (see Chapter 18 for more on this model) would be\n   Value5Dividend\nDiscount rate 2Growth rate5$154.6\n.0922.085$12,883 million   Example 12.3 A Stock Market Bubble? \n 20 We might ask why this logic of discounts and premiums does not apply to open-end mutual funds because they \nincur similar expense ratios. Because investors in these funds can redeem shares for NA V , the shares cannot sell \nat a discount to NA V . Expenses in open-end funds reduce returns in each period rather than being capitalized into price and inducing a discount.\n \n21 The following example is taken from R. A. Brealey, S. C.

Still, other evidence seems to tag the dot-com boom as at least partially irrational. \nConsider, for example, the results of a study documenting that firms adding \u201c.com\u201d to the \nend of their names during this period enjoyed a meaningful stock price increase.  22   That \ndoesn\u2019t sound like rational valuation.  \n  Evaluating the Behavioral Critique \n As investors, we are concerned with the existence of profit opportunities. The behavioral explanations of efficient market anomalies do not give guidance as to how to exploit any irrationality. For investors, the question is still whether there is money to be made from mispricing, and the behavioral literature is largely silent on this point. \n However, as we emphasized above, one of the important implications of the efficient \nmarket hypothesis is that security prices serve as reliable guides to the allocation of real assets. If prices are distorted, then capital markets will give misleading signals (and incen-tives) as to where the economy may best allocate resources. In this crucial dimension, the behavioral critique of the efficient market hypothesis is certainly important irrespective of any implication for investment strategies. \n There is considerable debate among financial economists concerning the strength of \nthe behavioral critique. Many believe that the behavioral approach is too unstructured, in effect allowing virtually any anomaly to be explained by some combination of irra-tionalities chosen from a laundry list of behavioral biases. While it is easy to \u201creverse engineer\u201d a behavioral explanation for any particular anomaly, these critics would like to see a consistent or unified behavioral theory that can explain a  range  of behavioral \nanomalies. \n More fundamentally, others are not convinced that the anomalies literature as a whole is \na convincing indictment of the efficient market hypothesis. Fama  \n23   notes that the anoma-\nlies are inconsistent in terms of their support for one type of irrationality versus another. For example, some papers document long-term corrections (consistent with overreac-tion), while others document long-term continuations of abnormal returns (consistent with underreaction). Moreover, the statistical significance of many of these results is hard to assess. Even small errors in choosing a benchmark against which to compare returns can cumulate to large apparent abnormalities in long-term returns.  This was quite close to the actual total value of those firms at the time. But the \nestimate is highly sensitive to the input values, and even a small reassessment of their \nprospects would result in a big revision of price. Suppose the expected dividend growth rate fell to 7.4%. This would reduce the value of the index to\n   Value5Dividend\nDiscount rate 2Growth rate5$154.6\n.0922.0745$8,589 million \nwhich was about the value to which the S&P 500 firms had fallen by October 2002. In \nlight of this example, the run-up and crash of the 1990s seems easier to reconcile with rational behavior. \nbod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   399bod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   399 7/17/13   3:46 PM7/17/13   3:46 PMFinal PDF to printer\n400 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n The behavioral critique of full rationality in investor decision making is well taken, but \nthe extent to which limited rationality affects asset pricing remains controversial. Whether \nor not investor irrationality affects asset prices, however, behavioral finance already makes important points about portfolio management. Investors who are aware of the potential pitfalls in information processing and decision making that seem to characterize their peers should be better able to avoid such errors. Ironically, the insights of behavioral finance may lead to some of the same policy conclusions embraced by efficient market advocates. For example, an easy way to avoid some of the behavioral minefields is to pursue passive, largely indexed, portfolio strategies. It seems that only rare individuals can consistently beat passive strategies; this conclusion may hold true whether your fellow investors are behavioral or rational.    \n   12.2 Technical Analysis and Behavioral Finance  \n Technical analysis attempts to exploit recurring and predictable patterns in stock prices to generate superior investment performance. Technicians do not deny the value of funda-mental information, but believe that prices only gradually close in on intrinsic value. As fundamentals shift, astute traders can exploit the adjustment to a new equilibrium. \n For example, one of the best-documented behavioral tendencies is the     disposition effect    ,  \nwhich refers to the tendency of investors to hold on to losing investments. Behavioral investors seem reluctant to realize losses. This disposition effect can lead to momentum in stock prices even if fundamental values follow a random walk.  \n24   The fact that the demand \nof \u201cdisposition investors\u201d for a company\u2019s shares depends on the price history of those shares means that prices could close in on fundamental values only over time, consistent with the central motivation of technical analysis.   \n Behavioral biases may also be consistent with technical analysts\u2019 use of volume data. \nAn important behavioral trait noted above is overconfidence, a systematic tendency to overestimate one\u2019s abilities. As traders become overconfident, they may trade more, induc-ing an association between trading volume and market returns.  \n25   Technical analysis thus \nuses volume data as well as price history to direct trading strategy. \n Finally, technicians believe that market fundamentals can be perturbed by irrational or \nbehavioral factors, sometimes labeled sentiment variables. More or less random price fluc-tuations will accompany any underlying price trend, creating opportunities to exploit cor-rections as these fluctuations dissipate. The nearby box explores the link between technical analysis and behavioral finance.  \n   Trends and Corrections \n Much of technical analysis seeks to uncover trends in market prices. This is in effect a search for momentum. Momentum can be absolute, in which case one searches for upward price trends, or relative, in which case the analyst looks to invest in one sector over another (or even take on a long-short position in the two sectors). Relative strength statistics are designed to uncover these potential opportunities. \n  24 Mark Grinblatt and Bing Han, \u201cProspect Theory, Mental Accounting, and Momentum,\u201d  Journal of Financial \nEconomics  78 (November 2005), pp. 311\u201339. \n  25 S.

A popular tool used for this purpose is the moving average. \n The moving average of a stock price is the average price over a given interval, where \nthat interval is updated as time passes. For example, a 50-day moving average traces the average price over the previous 50 days. The average is recomputed each day by dropping the oldest observation and adding the newest.  Figure\u00a012.3  is a moving average chart for Intel. Notice that the moving average (the colored curve) is a \u201csmoothed\u201d version of the original data series (the jagged dark curve).  \n After a period in which prices have been falling, the moving average will be above the \ncurrent price (because the moving average continues to average in the older and higher prices until they leave the sample period). In contrast, when prices have been rising, the moving average will be below the current price. \n Prices breaking through the moving average from below, as at point A in  Figure\u00a012.3 , is \ntaken as a bullish signal, because it signifies a shift from a falling trend (with prices below the moving average) to a rising trend (with prices above the moving average). Conversely, when prices drop below the moving average, as at point B, analysts might conclude that market momentum has become negative.    Technical Failure \n Practical traders, who believe themselves to be quite \nexempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some defunct mathematician. That is what Keynes might have said had he considered the faith placed by some investors in the work of Leonardo of Pisa, a 12th and 13th century number-cruncher. \n Better known as Fibonacci, Leonardo produced the \nsequence formed by adding consecutive components of \na series\u20141, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Numbers in this series crop up frequently in nature and the relationship between components tends towards 1.618, a figure known as the golden ratio in architecture and design. \n If it works for plants (and appears in \u201cThe Da Vinci \nCode\u201d), why shouldn\u2019t it work for financial markets? Some \ntraders believe that markets will change trend when they reach, say, 61.8% of the previous high, or are 61.8% above their low. \n Believers in Fibonacci numbers are part of a school \nknown as technical analysis, or chartism, which believes the \nfuture movement of asset prices can be divined from past data. But there is bad news for the numerologists. A new study *  by Professor Roy Batchelor and Richard Ramyar of \nthe Cass Business School, finds no evidence that Fibonacci numbers work in American stockmarkets.  \n This research may well fall on stony ground. Experience \nsuggests that chartists defend their territory with an almost \nreligious zeal. But their arguments are often anecdotal: \u201cIf technical analysis doesn\u2019t work, how come so-and-so is a multi-millionaire?\u201d This \u201csurvivorship bias\u201d ignores the many traders whose losses from using charts drive them out of the market. Furthermore, the recommendations of technical analysts can be so hedged about with qualifica-tions that they can validate almost any market outcome. \n If the efficient market theory is correct, technical anal-\nysis should not work at all; the prevailing market price \nshould reflect all information, including past price move-ments. However, academic fashion has moved in favor of behavioral finance, which suggests that investors may not be completely rational and that their psychological biases could cause prices to deviate from their \u201ccorrect\u201d level. Technical analysts also make the perfectly fair argument that those who analyze markets on the basis of fundamen-tals (such as economic statistics or corporate profits) are no more successful. \n All that talk of long waves is distinctly mystical and \nseems to take the deterministic view of history that human \nactivity is subject to some pre-ordained pattern. Chartists fall prey to their own behavioral flaw, finding \u201cconfir-mation\u201d of patterns everywhere, as if they were reading clouds in their coffee futures. \n Besides, technical analysis tends to increase trading \nactivity, creating extra costs. Hedge funds may be able to \nrise above these costs; small investors will not. As illusion-ists often proclaim, don\u2019t try this at home.

Each observation represents the closing level of the \nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) on the last trading day of the week. The 5-week \nmoving average for each week is the average of the DJIA over the previous 5 weeks. For \nexample, the first entry, for week 5, is the average of the index value between weeks 1 \nand 5: 13,290, 13,380, 13,399, 13,379, and 13,450. The next entry is the average of \nthe index values between weeks 2 and 6, and so on.  \n  Figure\u00a012.4  plots the level of the index and the 5-week moving average. Notice that \nwhile the index itself moves up and down rather abruptly, the moving average is a rela-\ntively smooth series, because the impact of each week\u2019s price movement is averaged \nwith that of the previous weeks. Week 16 is a bearish point according to the moving \naverage rule. The price series crosses from above the moving average to below it, signify-\ning the beginning of a downward trend in stock prices.

Two \nof the more famous ones are Elliott wave theory and Kondratieff waves. Both posit the \nexistence of long-term trends in stock market prices that may be disturbed by shorter-term \ntrends as well as daily fluctuations of little importance. Elliott wave theory superimposes \nlong-term and short-term wave cycles in an attempt to describe the complicated pattern of \nactual price movements. Once the longer-term waves are identified, investors presumably \ncan buy when the long-term direction of the market is positive. While there is consider-\nable noise in the actual evolution of stock prices, by properly interpreting the wave cycles, \none can, according to the theory, predict broad movements. Similarly, Kondratieff waves \nare named after a Russian economist who asserted that the macroeconomy (and therefore \nthe stock market) moves in broad waves lasting between 48 and 60 years. Kondratieff\u2019s \nassertion is hard to evaluate empirically, however, because cycles that last about 50 years \nprovide only two independent data points per century, which is hardly enough data to test \nthe predictive power of the theory.   \n  Relative Strength    Relative strength    measures the extent to which a security has \noutperformed or underperformed either the market as a whole or its particular industry. \nRelative strength is computed by calculating the ratio of the price of the security to a price \nindex for the industry. For example, the relative strength of Toyota versus the auto industry \nwould be measured by movements in the ratio of the price of Toyota divided by the level \nof an auto industry index. A rising ratio implies Toyota has been outperforming the rest of \nthe industry. If relative strength can be assumed to persist over time, then this would be a \nsignal to buy Toyota. \n Similarly, the strength of an industry relative to the whole market can be computed by \ntracking the ratio of the industry price index to the market price index. \n  Breadth   The    breadth    of the market is a measure of the extent to which movement in \na market index is reflected widely in the price movements of all the stocks in the market. \nThe most common measure of breadth is the spread between the number of stocks that \nadvance and decline in price. If advances outnumber declines by a wide margin, then \n Figure 12.4 Moving averages  \n13,700\n13,600\n13,500\n13,400\n13,300\n13,200\n13,100\n13,000\nWeekDow Jones Industrial Average\n1 3 5 7 9 1 11 31 51 71 9DJIA\nMoving Average\nbod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   403bod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   403 7/17/13   3:46 PM7/17/13   3:46 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 0 4 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nthe market is viewed as being stronger \nbecause the rally is widespread. These \nnumbers are reported in  The Wall Street \nJournal   (see  Figure\u00a012.5 ).  \n Some analysts cumulate breadth data \neach day as in  Table 12.1 . The cumulative \nbreadth for each day is obtained by adding \nthat day\u2019s net advances (or declines) to the \nprevious day\u2019s total. The direction of the \ncumulated series is then used to discern \nbroad market trends. Analysts might use a \nmoving average of cumulative breadth to \ngauge broad trends.    \n  Sentiment Indicators \n Behavioral finance devotes considerable \nattention to market  sentiment,   which may \nbe interpreted as the general level of opti-\nmism among investors. Technical analysts \nhave devised several measures of senti-\nment; we review a few of them. \n  Trin Statistic   Market volume is sometimes used to measure the strength of a market \nrise or fall. Increased investor participation in a market advance or retreat is viewed as \na measure of the significance of the movement. Technicians consider market advances \nto be a more favorable omen of continued price increases when they are associated with \nincreased trading volume. Similarly, market reversals are considered more bearish when \nassociated with higher volume. The    trin statistic    is defined as\n   T r i n5Volume declining/Number declining\nVolume advancin g/Number advancin g \nTherefore, trin is the ratio of average volume in declining issues to average volume in \nadvancing issues. Ratios above 1.0 are considered bearish because the falling stocks would \nthen have higher average volume than the advancing stocks, indicating net selling pressure.  \nThe Wall Street Journal Online   provides the data necessary to compute trin in its Markets \nDiary section. Using the data in  Figure\u00a012.5 , trin for the NYSE on this day was:\n   T r i n5$1,058,313/1,553\n$852,581/1,45551.16 \n Figure 12.5 Market Diary   \n Source:  The Wall Street Journal Online,   August 27, 2012.

Rising volume in \na rising market should not necessarily indicate a larger imbalance of buyers versus sellers. For example, a trin statistic above 1.0, which is considered bearish, could equally well be interpreted as indicating that there is more  buying  activity in declining issues.  \n  Confidence Index    Barron\u2019s  computes a confidence index using data from the bond \nmarket. The presumption is that actions of bond traders reveal trends that will emerge soon \nin the stock market. \n The    confidence index    is the ratio of the average yield on 10 top-rated corporate \nbonds divided by the average yield on 10 intermediate-grade corporate bonds. The ratio will always be below 100% because higher-rated bonds will offer lower promised yields to maturity. When bond traders are optimistic about the economy, however, they might require smaller default premiums on lower-rated debt. Hence, the yield spread will narrow, and the confidence index will approach 100%. Therefore, higher values of the confidence index are bullish signals.   \n Yields on lower-rated debt will rise after fears of recession have spread through the economy. This will \nreduce the confidence index. Should the stock market now be expected to fall or will it already have fallen?  CONCEPT CHECK 12.4 \n  Put/Call Ratio   Call options give investors the right to buy a stock at a fixed \u201cexercise\u201d \nprice and therefore are a way of betting on stock price increases. Put options give the right \nto sell a stock at a fixed price and therefore are a way of betting on stock price decreases.  26   \nThe ratio of outstanding put options to outstanding call options is called the    put/call ratio   . \nTypically, the put/call ratio hovers around 65%. Because put options do well in falling markets while call options do well in rising markets, deviations of the ratio from historical norms are considered to be a signal of market sentiment and therefore predictive of market movements.  \n Interestingly, however, a change in the ratio can be given a bullish or a bearish inter-\npretation. Many technicians see an increase in the ratio as bearish, as it indicates growing interest in put options as a hedge against market declines. Thus, a rising ratio is taken as a sign of broad investor pessimism and a coming market decline. Contrarian investors, however, believe that a good time to buy is when the rest of the market is bearish because stock prices are then unduly depressed. Therefore, they would take an increase in the put/call ratio as a signal of a buy opportunity.   \n  A Warning \n The search for patterns in stock market prices is nearly irresistible, and the ability of the human eye to discern apparent patterns is remarkable. Unfortunately, it is possible to perceive patterns that really don\u2019t exist. Consider  Figure\u00a012.6 , which presents simulated and actual values of the Dow Jones Industrial Average during 1956 taken from a famous study by Harry Roberts.  \n27   In  Figure 12.6, panel B,  the market appears to present a classic \n  26 Puts and calls were defined in Chapter 2, Section 2.5.

Figure 12.6, panel A  also looks like \na \u201ctypical\u201d stock market pattern.  \n Can you tell which of the two graphs is constructed from the real value of the Dow \nand which from the simulated data?  Figure 12.6, panel A  is based on the real data. The \ngraph in panel B was generated using \u201creturns\u201d created by a random-number generator. \nThese returns  by construction   were patternless, but the simulated price path that is plotted \nappears to follow a pattern much like that of panel A. \n  Figure\u00a0 12.7  shows the weekly price  changes   behind the two panels in  Figure\u00a0 12.6 . \nHere the randomness in both series\u2014the stock price as well as the simulated sequence\u2014is \nobvious.  \n A problem related to the tendency to perceive patterns where they don\u2019t exist is data \nmining. After the fact, you can always find patterns and trading rules that would have \ngenerated enormous profits. If you test enough rules, some will have worked in the past. \nUnfortunately, picking a theory that would have worked after the fact carries no guarantee \nof future success. \n In evaluating trading rules, you should always ask whether the rule would have seemed \nreasonable  before   you looked at the data. If not, you might be buying into the one arbitrary \nrule among many that happened to have worked in the recent past. The hard but crucial \nquestion is whether there is reason to believe that what worked in the past should continue \nto work in the future.     \n Figure 12.6 Actual and simulated levels for stock market prices of 52 weeks \n  Source: Harry Roberts, \u201cStock Market \u2018Patterns\u2019 and Financial Analysis: Methodological Suggestions,\u201d  Journal of Finance   14 (March 1959), \npp. 1\u201310.

Behavioral finance focuses on systematic irrationalities that characterize investor decision \nmaking. These \u201cbehavioral shortcomings\u201d may be consistent with several efficient market \nanomalies.  \n    2 .   Among the information processing errors uncovered in the psychology literature are memory \nbias, overconfidence, conservatism, and representativeness. Behavioral tendencies include fram-\ning, mental accounting, regret avoidance, and loss aversion.  \n    3 .   Limits to arbitrage activity impede the ability of rational investors to exploit pricing errors \ninduced by behavioral investors. For example, fundamental risk means that even if a security is \nmispriced, it still can be risky to attempt to exploit the mispricing. This limits the actions of arbi-\ntrageurs who take positions in mispriced securities. Other limits to arbitrage are implementation \ncosts, model risk, and costs to short-selling. Occasional failures of the Law of One Price suggest \nthat limits to arbitrage are sometimes severe.  \n    4 .   The various limits to arbitrage mean that even if prices do not equal intrinsic value, it still may be \ndifficult to exploit the mispricing. As a result, the failure of traders to beat the market may not be \nproof that markets are in fact efficient, with prices equal to intrinsic value.  \n    5 .   Technical analysis is the search for recurring and predictable patterns in stock prices. It is based \non the premise that prices only gradually close in on intrinsic value. As fundamentals shift, astute \ntraders can exploit the adjustment to a new equilibrium.  \n    6 .   Technical analysis also uses volume data and sentiment indicators. These are broadly consis-\ntent with several behavioral models of investor activity. Moving averages, relative strength, and \nbreadth are used in other trend-based strategies.  \n    7 .   Some sentiment indicators are the trin statistic, the confidence index, and the put/call ratio.

Don Sampson begins a meeting with his financial adviser by outlining his investment phi-\nlosophy as shown below:\n Statement Number  Statement \n 1  Investments should offer strong return potential but with very limited risk. \nI prefer to be conservative and to minimize losses, even if I miss out on \nsubstantial growth opportunities. \n 2  All nongovernmental investments should be in industry-leading and \n financially strong companies. \n 3  Income needs should be met entirely through interest income and cash \ndividends. All equity securities held should pay cash dividends. \n 4  Investment decisions should be based primarily on consensus forecasts \nof general economic conditions and company-specific growth. \n 5  If an investment falls below the purchase price, that security should be \nretained until it returns to its original cost. Conversely, I prefer to take \nquick profits on successful investments. \n 6  I will direct the purchase of investments, including derivative securities, \nperiodically. These aggressive investments result from personal research \nand may not prove consistent with my investment policy. I have not kept \nrecords on the performance of similar past investments, but I have had \nsome \u201cbig winners.\u201d \n Select the statement from the table above that best illustrates each of the following behavioral finance \nconcepts. Justify your selection.\n     a.  Mental accounting.  \n    b.  Overconfidence (illusion of control).  \n    c.  Reference dependence (framing).     \n   2. Monty Frost\u2019s tax-deferred retirement account is invested entirely in equity securities. \nBecause the international portion of his portfolio has performed poorly in the past, he \nhas reduced his international equity exposure to 2%. Frost\u2019s investment adviser has rec-\nommended an increased international equity exposure. Frost responds with the following \ncomments:\n     a.  On the basis of past poor performance, I want to sell all my remaining international equity \nsecurities once their market prices rise to equal their original cost.  \n    b.  Most diversified international portfolios have had disappointing results over the past 5 years. \nDuring that time, however, the market in Country XYZ has outperformed all other markets, \neven our own. If I do increase my international equity exposure, I would prefer that the \nentire exposure consist of securities from Country XYZ.  \n    c.  International investments are inherently more risky. Therefore, I prefer to purchase any \ninternational equity securities in my \u201cspeculative\u201d account, my best chance at becoming \nrich. I do not want them in my retirement account, which has to protect me from poverty in \nmy old age.   \n  Frost\u2019s adviser is familiar with behavioral finance concepts but prefers a traditional or standard \nfinance approach (modern portfolio theory) to investments. \nbod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   411bod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   411 7/17/13   3:46 PM7/17/13   3:46 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm412 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n    Indicate the behavioral finance concept that Frost most directly exhibits in each of his three \ncomments.

During an interview with her investment adviser, a retired investor made the following two \nstatements:     a.  \u201cI have been very pleased with the returns I\u2019ve earned on Petrie stock over the past 2 years and \nI am certain that it will be a superior performer in the future.\u201d  \n    b.  \u201cI am pleased with the returns from the Petrie stock because I have specific uses for that money. \nFor that reason, I certainly want my retirement fund to continue owning the Petrie stock.\u201d   \n  Identify which principle of behavioral finance is most consistent with each of the investor\u2019s two \nstatements.  \n   5. Claire Pierce comments on her life circumstances and investment outlook:\n  I must support my parents who live overseas on Pogo Island. The Pogo Island \neconomy has grown rapidly over the past 2 years with minimal inflation, and consensus forecasts call for a continuation of these favorable trends for the foreseeable future. Economic growth has resulted from the export of a natural resource used in an exciting new technology application. \n I want to invest 10% of my portfolio in Pogo Island government bonds. I plan \nto purchase long-term bonds because my parents are likely to live more than \n10 years. Experts uniformly do not foresee a resurgence of inflation on Pogo Island, so I am certain that the total returns produced by the bonds will cover my parents\u2019 spending needs for many years to come. There should be no exchange rate risk because the bonds are denominated in local currency. I want to buy the Pogo Island bonds, but am not willing to distort my portfolio\u2019s long-term asset allocation to do so. The overall mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments should not change. Therefore, I am considering selling one of my U.S. bond funds to raise cash to buy the Pogo Island bonds. One possibility is my High Yield Bond Fund, which has declined 5% in value year to date. I am not excited about this fund\u2019s prospects; in fact I think it is likely to decline more, but there is a small probability that it could recover very quickly. So I have decided instead to sell my Core Bond Fund that has appreciated 5% this year. I expect this investment to continue to deliver attractive returns, but there is a small chance this year\u2019s gains might disappear quickly. \n Once that shift is accomplished, my investments will be in great shape. The \nsole exception is my Small Company Fund, which has performed poorly. I plan to \nsell this investment as soon as the price increases to my original cost.   \n Identify three behavioral finance concepts illustrated in Pierce\u2019s comments and describe each of the three concepts. Discuss how an investor practicing standard or traditional finance would challenge each of the three concepts.    \nbod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   412bod61671_ch12_388-413.indd   412 7/17/13   3:46 PM7/17/13   3:46 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 12 Behavioral Finance and Technical Analysis  413\n    1. Conservatism implies that investors will at first respond too slowly to new information, leading to \ntrends in prices. Representativeness can lead them to extrapolate trends too far into the future and \novershoot intrinsic value. Eventually, when the pricing error is corrected, we observe a reversal.  \n   2. Out-of-favor stocks will exhibit low prices relative to various proxies for intrinsic value such as \nearnings. Because of regret avoidance, these stocks will need to offer a more attractive rate of return to induce investors to hold them. Thus, low P/E stocks might on average offer higher rates of return.  \n   3. At liquidation, price will equal NA V . This puts a limit on fundamental risk. Investors need only \ncarry the position for a few months to profit from the elimination of the discount. Moreover, as the liquidation date approaches, the discount should dissipate. This greatly limits the risk that the discount can move against the investor. At the announcement of impending liquidation, the discount should immediately disappear, or at least shrink considerably.  \n   4.

The \nvery existence of such a vast literature sug-gests a serious problem is involved\u2014 testing \nthese models is not trivial. Indeed, an impor-tant part of the work here is to understand the challenges in doing so. \n All models of capital asset pricing have two \nparts. First, they derive the optimal portfo-\nlio of an individual investor, conditional on a utility function (describing how an investor trades off risk against expected return) and an input list that includes estimates of port-folio expected returns and risk. Second, they derive predictions about expected returns on capital assets in equilibrium, when investors complete the trades necessary to arrive at their personal optimal portfolios. \n Obviously, the flow of new information \nalone will change input lists and thus desired \nportfolios. Here is where the efficient mar-ket hypothesis (EMH) kicks in. If asset prices reflect all available information, then  changes\nof asset prices resulting from new informa-tion will have zero means, that is, prices will follow random walks.  \n1   The response to new information will introduce noise around the \npredictions of the model, but by itself this should not cause any difficulty that cannot be overcome with appropriate statistical meth-ods and lots of data. But when the EMH is off, even temporarily, by economically signifi-cant margins, changes in prices and expected returns will not change randomly and model predictions can be affected. This is why a test of an asset pricing model is of necessity a joint test of the EMH.  \n The single-factor CAPM has one key impli-\ncation that can be expressed in either of two \nways: The market portfolio is mean-variance efficient, and (equivalently) the risk premium (expected excess return) on each individual asset is proportional to its beta,  E ( R  \n i  )\u00a0 5 \u00a0 b   i   E ( R   M  ). \nThe first statement is, in practice, untestable \nbecause we do not observe the market port-folio. However, if a broad index is sufficiently well diversified, even if not mean-variance efficient, it may nevertheless support the mean-beta relationship (the SML) using the arguments of the\u00a0APT. \n Testing the ex-ante mean-variance effi-\nciency of a particular market index can never  CHAPTER THIRTEEN \n Empirical Evidence \non Security Returns \n1 Actually, prices will show an upward drift since expected rates of return are positive. But over short time horizons, this drift is \ntrivial compared to volatility. For example, at a daily horizon, the expected rate of return is around 5 basis points (corresponding to \nan annual return of 12%). The daily standard deviation of stock prices is an order of magnitude higher, typically exceeding 2% for individual stocks. \nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   414bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   414 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n(concluded)\n415    13.1 The Index Model and the Single-Factor APT be a conclusive test of the CAPM. In any sample, \nthere always is an ex-post efficient portfolio that will never be identical to the index. How do we measure \u201cdistance from efficiency,\u201d and what would constitute a rejection of the model? Given these difficulties, the mean-beta equa-tion has been the test arena of most research. However, most of these tests are better inter-preted as tests of the APT (rather than the CAPM) since we know from the outset that the index may not be mean-variance efficient but may nevertheless be well-diversified.  We begin with tests of the single-factor security \nmarket line, the theater where the basic meth-\nodologies have been developed, and then pro-ceed to multifactor models with emphasis on the empirically motivated Fama-French three-factor model. We show how this research may be inter-preted as tests of Merton\u2019s multifactor ICAPM. We end this part of the chapter with a section that brings liquidity into the empirical framework. We devote a section to the theoretically appealing consumption CAPM in order to present the equity premium puzzle, and end with an assessment of where research into asset  pricing is headed.  \n   The Expected Return\u2013Beta Relationship \n Recall that if the expected return\u2013beta relationship holds with respect to an observable ex \nante efficient index,  M,  the expected rate of return on any security  i  is   \n E(ri)5rf1bi3E(rM)2rf4  (13.1)   \n where  b   i   is defined as    Cov (ri, rM)/sM2.  \n This is the most commonly tested implication of the CAPM. Early simple tests \nfollowed three basic steps: establishing sample data, estimating the SCL (security charac-\nteristic line), and estimating the SML (security market line). \n  Setting Up the Sample Data   Determine a sample period of, for example, 60 monthly \nholding periods (5 years). For each of the 60 holding periods, collect the rates of return on \n100 stocks, a market portfolio proxy (e.g., the S&P 500), and 1-month (risk-free) T-bills. Your data thus consist of\n    r  \n it  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 6,000\u00a0returns on the 100 stocks over the 60-month sample period;  i \u00a0 5 \u00a01, .\u00a0.\u00a0. ,\u00a0100, \nand  t \u00a0 5 \u00a01, .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0,\u00a060.  \n   r   Mt  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 60\u00a0observations of the returns on the S&P 500 index over the sample period \n(one each month).  \n   r   ft  \u00a0 5 \u00a060\u00a0observations of the risk-free rate (one each month).    \n This constitutes a table of 102\u00a0 3 \u00a060\u00a0 5 \u00a06,120 rates of return.  \n  Estimating the SCL   View Equation 13.1 as a security characteristic line (SCL), as \nin Chapter 8. For each stock,  i,  you estimate the beta coefficient as the slope of a    first-pass \nregression    equation.

More generally, according to the CAPM, the risk premium depends only on beta. Therefore,  any  additional right-hand-side variable in Equation 13.3 beyond beta \nshould have a coefficient that is insignificantly different from zero in the second-pass regression.   \nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   416bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   416 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 13 Empirical Evidence on Security Returns 417\n  Tests of the CAPM \n Early tests of the CAPM performed by John Lintner,  2   and later replicated by Merton Miller \nand Myron Scholes,  3   used annual data on 631 NYSE stocks for 10 years, 1954 to 1963, and \nproduced the following estimates (with returns expressed as decimals rather than percentages):  \n              Coefficient:      g  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.127      g  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.042      g  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.310   \n   Standard error:     .006     .006     .026   \n   Sample average:             r M2rf5.165           \n These results are inconsistent with the CAPM.

What is the implication of the estimate of  g  2 ?    CONCEPT CHECK 13.2 \n The two-stage procedure employed by these researchers (i.e., first estimate security \nbetas using a time-series regression and then use those betas to test the SML relationship \nbetween risk and average return) seems straightforward, and the rejection of the CAPM using this approach is disappointing. However, it turns out that there are several difficulties with this approach. First and foremost, stock returns are extremely volatile, which lessens the precision of any tests of average return. For example, the average standard deviation of annual returns of the stocks in the S&P 500 is about 40%; the average standard deviation of annual returns of the stocks included in these tests is probably even higher. \n In addition, there are fundamental concerns about the validity of the tests. First, the  market \nindex used in the tests is surely not the \u201cmarket portfolio\u201d of the CAPM. Second, in light of asset volatility, the security betas from the first-stage regressions are necessarily estimated with substantial sampling error and therefore cannot readily be used as inputs to the second-stage regression. Finally, investors cannot borrow at the risk-free rate, as assumed by the simple version of the CAPM. Let us investigate the implications of these problems in turn.  \n  The Market Index \n In what has come to be known as  Roll\u2019s critique,  Richard Roll  4   pointed out that:\n    1. There is a single testable hypothesis associated with the CAPM: The market portfo-\nlio is mean-variance efficient.  \n   2. All the other implications of the model, the best-known being the linear relation \nbetween expected return and beta, follow from the market portfolio\u2019s efficiency \nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   417bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   417 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n418 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nand therefore are not independently testable. There is an \u201cif and only if\u201d relation \nbetween the expected return\u2013beta relationship and the efficiency of the market portfolio.  \n   3. In any sample of observations of individual returns there will be an infinite number \nof ex post (i.e., after the fact) mean-variance efficient portfolios using the sample-period returns and covariances (as opposed to the ex ante  expected  returns and \ncovariances). Sample betas of individual assets estimated against each such ex-post efficient portfolio will be exactly linearly related to the sample average returns of these assets. In other words, if betas are calculated against such portfolios, they will satisfy the SML relation exactly whether or not the true market portfolio is mean-variance efficient in an ex ante sense.  \n   4. The CAPM is not testable unless we know the exact composition of the true market \nportfolio and use it in the tests. This implies that the theory is not testable unless  all  \nindividual assets are included in the sample.  \n   5. Using a proxy such as the S&P 500 for the market portfolio is subject to two dif-\nficulties. First, the proxy itself might be mean-variance efficient even when the true market portfolio is not. Conversely, the proxy may turn out to be inefficient, but obviously this alone implies nothing about the true market portfolio\u2019s efficiency. Furthermore, most reasonable market proxies will be very highly correlated with each other and with the true market portfolio whether or not they are mean-variance efficient. Such a high degree of correlation will make it seem that the exact compo-sition of the market portfolio is unimportant, whereas the use of different proxies can lead to quite different conclusions. This problem is referred to as    benchmark \nerror    ,  because it refers to the use of an incorrect benchmark (market proxy) portfo-\nlio in the tests of the theory.    \n Roll and Ross  \n5   and Kandel and Stambaugh  6   expanded Roll\u2019s critique. Essentially, they \nargued that tests that reject a positive relationship between average return and beta point to inefficiency of the market proxy used in those tests, rather than refuting the theoretical expected return\u2013beta relationship. They demonstrate that even if the CAPM is true, highly diversified portfolios, such as the value- or equally weighted portfolios of all stocks in the sample, may fail to produce a significant average return\u2013beta relationship.\n \n Kandel and Stambaugh considered the properties of the usual two-pass test of the \nCAPM in an environment in which borrowing is restricted but the zero-beta version of the CAPM holds. In this case, you will recall that the expected return\u2013beta relationship describes the expected returns on a stock, a portfolio  E  on the efficient frontier, and that \nportfolio\u2019s zero-beta companion,  Z  (see Equation 9.12):   \n E(r\ni)2E(rZ)5bi3E(rE)2E(rZ)4  (13.4)   \n where  b   i   denotes the beta of security  i  on efficient portfolio  E.  \n We cannot construct or observe the efficient portfolio  E  (because we do not know \nexpected returns and covariances of all assets), and so we cannot estimate Equation 13.4 \ndirectly. Kandel and Stambaugh asked what would happen if we followed the common procedure of using a market proxy portfolio  M  in place of  E,  and used as well the more \n5Richard Roll and Stephen A.

If the market index used in the regression is fully efficient, the test will be well specified. But the second-pass regression will provide a poor test of the CAPM if the proxy for the market portfolio is not efficient. Thus, we still cannot test the model in a meaningful way without a reasonably efficient market proxy. Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine how efficient our market index is, so we can-not tell how good our tests are. \n Given the impossibility of testing the CAPM directly, we can retreat to testing the APT, \nwhich produces the same mean-beta equation (the security market line).  \n7   This model \ndepends only on the index portfolio being well diversified. Choosing a broad market index allows us to test the SML as applied to the chosen index.\n  \n  Measurement Error in Beta \n It is well known in statistics that if the right-hand-side variable of a regression equation is measured with error (in our case, beta is measured with error and is the right-hand-side variable in the second-pass regression), then the slope coefficient of the regression equation will be biased downward and the intercept biased upward. This is consistent with the findings cited above;  g  \n0  was higher than predicted by the CAPM and  g  1  was lower than predicted. \n Indeed, a well-controlled simulation test by Miller and Scholes  8   confirms these argu-\nments. In this test a random-number generator simulated rates of return with covariances similar to observed ones. The average returns were made to agree exactly with the CAPM. Miller and Scholes then used these randomly generated rates of return in the tests we have described as if they were observed from a sample of stock returns. The results of this \u201csimulated\u201d test were virtually identical to those reached using real data, despite the fact that the simulated returns were  constructed  to obey the SML, that is, the true  g  coefficients \nwere    g\n050, g 15rM2rf,  and  g  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a00.  9   \n This postmortem of the early test gets us back to square one. We can explain away \nthe  disappointing test results, but we have no positive results to support the CAPM-APT implications. \n The next wave of tests was designed to overcome the measurement error problem that \nled to biased estimates of the SML. The innovation in these tests, pioneered by Black, Jensen, and Scholes,  \n10   was to use portfolios rather than individual securities. Combining \nsecurities into portfolios diversifies away most of the firm-specific part of returns, thereby \n7Although the APT strictly applies only to well-diversified portfolios, the discussion in Chapter 9 shows that \noptimization in a single-index market as prescribed by Treynor and Black will generate strong pressure on single \nsecurities to satisfy the mean-beta equation as well.\n8Miller and Scholes, \u201cRate of Return in Relation to Risk.\u201d\n9In statistical tests, there are two possible errors: Type I and Type II. A Type I error means that you reject a null \nhypothesis (for example, a hypothesis that beta does not affect expected returns) when it is actually true. This is sometimes called a false positive, in which you incorrectly decide that a relationship exists when it actually does not. The probability of this error is called the significance level of the test statistic. Thresholds for rejection of the null hypothesis are usually chosen to limit the probability of Type I error to below 5%. Type II error is a false negative, in which a relationship actually does exist, but you fail to detect it. The power of a test equals \n(1\u00a02\u00a0probability of Type II). Miller and Scholes\u2019s experiment showed that early tests of the CAPM had low \npower.\n10Fischer Black, Michael C.

This mitigates the statistical problems that arise from measurement error in the beta estimates.\n \n Testing the model with diversified portfolios rather than individual securities completes \nour retreat to the APT. Additionally, combining stocks into portfolios reduces the number of observations left for the second-pass regression. Suppose we group the 100 stocks into five portfolios of 20 stocks each. If the residuals of the 20 stocks in each portfolio are prac-tically uncorrelated, the variance of the portfolio residual will be about one-twentieth the residual variance of the average stock. Thus the portfolio beta in the first-pass regression will be estimated with far better accuracy. However, with portfolios of 20 stocks each, we are left with only five observations for the second-pass regression. \n To get the best of this trade-off, we need to construct portfolios with the largest pos-\nsible dispersion of beta coefficients. Other things equal, a regression yields more accu-rate estimates the more widely spaced the observations of the independent variables. We therefore will attempt to maximize the range of the independent variable of the  second-pass regression, the portfolio betas. Rather than allocate 20 stocks to each portfolio randomly, we first rank stocks by betas. Portfolio 1 is formed from the 20 highest-beta stocks and portfolio 5 the 20 lowest-beta stocks. A set of portfolios with small nonsys-tematic components,  e  \n P  , and widely spaced betas will yield reasonably powerful tests of \nthe SML. \n Fama and MacBeth (FM)  11   used this methodology to verify that the observed relation-\nship between average excess returns and beta is indeed linear and that nonsystematic risk \ndoes not explain average excess returns. Using 20 portfolios constructed according to the Black, Jensen, and Scholes methodology, FM expanded the estimation of the SML equa-tion to include the square of the beta coefficient (to test for linearity of the relationship between returns and betas) and the estimated standard deviation of the residual (to test for the explanatory power of nonsystematic risk). For a sequence of many subperiods, they estimated for each subperiod the equation   \n r\ni5g01g1bi1g2bi21g3s(ei)  (13.5)   \n The term  g  2  measures potential nonlinearity of return, and  g  3  measures the explanatory \npower of nonsystematic risk,  s ( e   i  ). According to the CAPM, both  g  2  and  g  3  should have \ncoefficients of zero in the second-pass regression. \n FM estimated Equation 13.5 for every month of the period January 1935 through June \n1968. The results are summarized in  Table 13.1 , which shows average coefficients and \n t -statistics for the overall period as well as for three subperiods. FM observed that the \ncoefficients on residual standard deviation (nonsystem-\natic risk), denoted by  g  3 , fluctuated greatly from month \nto month, and its   t -statistics were insignificant despite \nlarge average  values. Thus, the overall test results were reasonably favorable to the security market line of the CAPM (or perhaps more accurately of the APT that FM actually tested). But time has not been favorable to the CAPM since.  \n Recent replications of the FM test show that results \ndeteriorate in later periods (since 1968).

We begin with \nthe third source because there is little doubt that nontraded assets in the personal portfolios \nof investors affect demand for traded risky assets. Hence, a factor representing these assets, \nthat is, one correlated with their returns, should affect risk premiums.  \n   Labor Income \n The major factors in the omitted asset category are labor income and private business. \nTaking on labor income first, Mayers  12   viewed each individual as being endowed with \nlabor income but able to trade only securities and an index portfolio.

The result of his \nmodel is an SML that is flatter than the simple CAPM\u2019s.

But suppose investors can trade a portfolio that is correlated with the return on aggregate human capital. Then their hedging demands against the risk to the value of their human capital might meaningfully influence security prices and risk premia. If so, human capital risk (or some empirical proxy for it) can serve as an additional factor in a multifactor SML. Stocks with a positive beta on the value of labor exaggerate exposure to this risk factor; therefore, they will command lower prices, or equivalently, provide a larger-than-CAPM risk premium. Thus, by adding this factor, the SML becomes multidimensional. \n \n Jagannathan and Wang  14   used the rate of change in aggregate labor income as a proxy \nfor changes in the value of human capital. In addition to the standard security betas esti-mated using the value-weighted stock market index, which we denote  b  \nvw , they also esti-\nmated the betas of assets with respect to labor income growth, which we denote  b  labor . \nFinally, they considered the possibility that business cycles affect asset betas, an issue that has been examined in a number of other studies.  \n15   These may be viewed as  conditional  \nbetas, as their values are conditional on the state of the economy. Jagannathan and Wang used the spread between the yields on low- and high-grade corporate bonds as a proxy for the state of the business cycle and estimate asset betas relative to this business cycle vari-able; we denote this beta as  b  \nprem . With the estimates of these three betas for several stock \nportfolios, Jagannathan and Wang estimated a second-pass regression which includes firm size (market value of equity, denoted ME):   \n E(R\ni)5c01csize log(ME)1cvwbvw1cprembprem1claborblabor  (13.6)   \n Jagannathan and Wang test their model with 100 portfolios that are designed to spread \nsecurities on the basis of size and beta. Stocks are sorted into 10 size portfolios, and the stocks \nwithin each size decile are further sorted by beta into 10 subportfolios, resulting in 100 port-folios in total.  Table 13.2  shows a subset of the various versions of the second-pass estimates. The first two rows in the table show the coefficients and  t -statistics of a test of the CAPM \nalong the lines of the Fama and MacBeth tests introduced in the previous section. The result is a sound rejection of the model, as the coefficient on beta is negative, albeit not significant.   \n The next two rows show that the model is not helped by the addition of the size factor. \nThe dramatic increase in  R -square (from 1.35% to 57%) shows that size explains variations \nin average returns quite well while beta does not. Substituting the default premium and labor income for size (panel B) results in a similar increase in explanatory power ( R -square \nof 55%), but the CAPM expected return\u2013beta relationship is not redeemed. The default premium is significant, while labor income is borderline significant. When we add size as \n13Asset betas on the index portfolio are likely positively correlated with their betas on the omitted asset (for \nexample, aggregate labor income). Therefore, the coefficient on asset beta in the SML regression (of returns on \nindex beta) will be downward biased, resulting in a slope smaller than average R M.

They clearly \ndo not fully capture the cyclicality of stock returns and thus do not accurately measure the \nsystematic risk of stocks. This actually can be interpreted as good news for the CAPM in \nthat it may be possible to replace the simple beta with better estimates of systematic risk \nand transfer the explanatory power of instrumental variables such as size and the default \npremium to the index rate of return. Second, and more relevant to the work of Jagannathan \nand Wang, is the conclusion that human capital will be important in any version of the \nCAPM that better explains the systematic risk of securities.  \n  Private (Nontraded) Business \n Whereas Jagannathan and Wang focus on labor income, Heaton and Lucas  16   estimate the \nimportance of proprietary business. We expect that private-business owners will reduce \ndemand for traded securities that are positively correlated with their specific entrepreneurial \nincome. If this effect is sufficiently important, aggregate demand for traded securities will \nbe determined in part by the covariance with aggregate noncorporate business income. The \nrisk premium on securities with high covariance with noncorporate business income should \nbe commensurately higher.  \nTable 13.2\nEvaluation of various CAPM specifications\nThis table gives the estimates for the cross-sectional regression model\nE(Rit)5c01csizelog(ME i)1cvwbivw1cprembiprem1claborbilabor\nwith either a subset or all of the variables.

The share of private business in total \nwealth (labeled \u201crelative business\u201d) receives negative and statistically significant coeffi-\ncients in these regressions. Notice also the negative and significant coefficient on risk atti-\ntude based on a self-reported degree of risk aversion.   \n Finally, Heaton and Lucas extend Jagannathan and Wang\u2019s equation to include the rate \nof change in proprietary-business wealth. They find that this variable also is significant and \nimproves the explanatory power of the regression.

Specification of risk factors.  \n   2. Identification of portfolios that hedge these fundamental risk factors.     3. Test of the explanatory power and risk premiums of the hedge portfolios.     \n  A Macro Factor Model \n Chen, Roll, and Ross  17   identify several possible variables that might proxy for systematic \nfactors:\n   IP\u00a0 5 \u00a0Growth rate in industrial production.  \n   EI\u00a0 5 \u00a0 Changes in expected inflation measured by changes in short-term (T-bill) \ninterest rates.  \n  UI\u00a0 5 \u00a0 Unexpected inflation defined as the difference between actual and expected \ninflation.  \n  CG\u00a0 5 \u00a0 Unexpected changes in risk premiums measured by the difference between the \nreturns on corporate Baa-rated bonds and long-term government bonds.  \n  GB\u00a0 5 \u00a0 Unexpected changes in the term premium measured by the difference between \nthe returns on long- and short-term government bonds.    \n With the identification of these potential economic factors, Chen, Roll, and Ross skipped \nthe procedure of identifying factor portfolios (the portfolios that have the highest correla-tion with the factors). Instead, by using the factors themselves, they implicitly assumed that factor portfolios exist that can proxy for the factors. They use these factors in a test similar to that of Fama and MacBeth. \n A critical part of the methodology is the grouping of stocks into portfolios. Recall that in \nthe single-factor tests, portfolios were constructed to span a wide range of betas to enhance the power of the test. In a multifactor framework the efficient criterion for grouping is less obvious. Chen, Roll, and Ross chose to group the sample stocks into 20 portfolios by size (market value of outstanding equity), a variable that is known to be associated with average stock returns. \n They first used 5 years of monthly data to estimate the factor betas of the 20 portfolios \nin 20 first-pass regressions.   \n r5a1\nbMrM1bIPIP1bEIEI1bUIUI1bCGCG1bGBGB1e  (13.7a)   \n where  M  stands for the stock market index. Chen, Roll, and Ross used as the market index \nboth the value-weighted NYSE index (VWNY) and the equally weighted NYSE index (EWNY). \n Using the 20 sets of first-pass estimates of factor betas as the independent variables, \nthey now estimated the second-pass regression (with 20 observations):   \n r5g\n01gMbM1gIPbIP1gEIbEI1gUIbUI1gCGbCG1gGBbGB1e  (13.7b)   \n where the gammas become estimates of the risk premiums on the factors. \n Chen, Roll, and Ross ran this second-pass regression for every month of their sample \nperiod, reestimating the first-pass factor betas once every 12 months. The estimated risk pre-\nmiums (the values for the parameters, g ) were averaged over all the second-pass regressions. \n Note in  Table 13.4  that the two market indexes EWNY and VWNY are not statistically \nsignificant (their  t -statistics of 1.218 and  2 .633 are less than 2).

They also introduced a general method to generate factor port-\nfolios and applied their method to these firm characteristics. Exploring this innovation is a \nuseful way to understand the empirical building blocks of a multifactor asset pricing model. \n Suppose you find, as Fama and French did, that stock market capitalization (or \u201cmarket \ncap\u201d) seems to predict alpha values in a CAPM equation. On average, the smaller the mar-\nket cap, the greater the alpha of a stock. This finding would add size to the list of anomalies \nthat refute the CAPM. \n But suppose you believe that size varies with sensitivity to changes in future investment \nopportunities. Then, what appears as alpha in a single factor CAPM is really an extra-market \nsource of risk in a multifactor CAPM. If this sounds far-fetched, here\u2019s a story: When \ninvestors anticipate a market downturn, they adjust their portfolios to minimize their expo-\nsure to losses. Suppose that small stocks generally are harder hit in down markets, akin to a \nlarger beta in bad times. Then investors will avoid such stocks in favor of the less-sensitive \nstocks of larger firms. This would explain a risk premium to small size beyond the beta on \ncontemporaneous market returns. An \u201calpha\u201d for size may be instead an ICAPM risk pre-\nmium for assets with greater sensitivity to deterioration in future investment opportunities. \n18Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R.

Recall that the dis-\ntribution of corporate size is asymmetric: a few big and many small corporations. Since \nthe NYSE is the exchange where bigger stocks trade, Fama and French first determine the median size of NYSE stocks. They use this median to classify all traded U.S. stocks (NYSE\u00a0 1 \u00a0AMEX\u00a0 1 \u00a0NASDAQ) as big or small and create one portfolio from big stocks \nand another from small stocks. Finally, each of these portfolios is value-weighted for effi-cient diversification. \n As in the APT, Fama and French construct a zero-net-investment size-factor portfolio \nby going long the small- and going short the big-stock portfolio. The return of this portfo-lio, called SMB (small minus big), is simply the return on the small-stock portfolio minus the return on the big-stock portfolio. If size is priced, then this portfolio will exhibit a risk premium. Because the SMB is practically well diversified (on the order of 4,000 stocks), it joins the market-index portfolio in a two-factor APT model with size as the extra-market source of risk. In the two-factor SML, the risk premium on any asset should be determined by its loadings (betas) on the two factor portfolios. This is a testable hypothesis. \n Fama and French use this approach to form both size and book-to-market ratio (B/M) \nfactors. To create these two extra-market risk factors, they double-sort stocks by both size and B/M. They break the U.S. stock population into three groups based on B/M ratio: the bottom 30% (low), the middle 40% (medium), and the top 30% (high).  \n19   Now six portfo-\nlios are created based on the intersections of the size and B/M sorts: Small/Low; Small/Medium; Small/High; Big/Low; Big/Medium; Big/High. Each of these six portfolios is value weighted.\n \n The returns on the Big and Small portfolio are:   \nRS51@3(RS/L1RS/M1RS/H); RB51@3(RB/L1RB/M1RB/H)  \n Similarly, the returns on the high and low (Value and Growth  20  ) portfolios are:   \nRH51@2(RSH1RBH); RL51@2(RSL1RBL)  \n The returns of the zero-net-investment factors SMB (Small minus Big, i.e., Long Small and Short Big), and HML (High minus Low, i.e., Long High B/M and Short Low B/M) are created from these portfolios:   \nRSMB5RS2RB; RHML5RH2RL  \n We measure the sensitivity of individual stocks to the factors by estimating the factor betas from first-pass regressions of stock excess returns on the excess return of the market index as well as on  R  \n SMB   and  R   HML  . These factor betas should, as a group, predict the total risk \npremium. Therefore, the Fama-French three-factor asset-pricing model is  21     \n E(ri)2rf5ai1bi3E(rM)2rf41siE3SMB 41hiE3HML 4  (13.8)   \n19Fama and French could have experimented with optimal break points for the three B/M groups, but such an \napproach might quickly give way to data mining.\n20High B/M stocks are called value assets because, for the large part, their market values derive from assets \nalready in place. Low B/M are called growth stocks because their market values derive from expected growth in \nfuture cash flows. One needs to assume high growth to justify the prices at which the assets trade. At the same time, however, a firm that falls into hard times will see its market price fall and its B/M ratio rise. So some of the so-called value firms may actually be distressed firms. This subgroup of the value-firm portfolio may well account for the value premium of the B/M factor.\n21We subtract the risk-free rate from the return on the market portfolio, but not from the SMB and HML returns \nbecause the SMB and HML factors are zero-net-investment portfolios. Hence their entire return already is a pre-mium. There is no opportunity cost from giving up the risk-free investment to switch into these portfolios.\nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   427bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   427 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 2 8 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n The coefficients  b   i  ,\u00a0  s   i  , and  h   i   are the \nbetas (also called  loadings   in this con-\ntext) of the stock on the three factors. \nIf these are the only risk factors, excess \nreturns on all assets should be fully \nexplained by risk premiums due to \nthese factor loadings. In other words, \nif these factors fully explain asset \nreturns, the intercept of the equation \nshould be zero. \n Goyal  22   surveys asset pricing \ntests. He applies Equation 13.8 to the \nreturns of 25 portfolios of all U.S. \nstocks sorted by size and B/M ratio. \n Figure\u00a0 13.1  shows the average actual \nreturn of each portfolio over the period \n1946\u20132010 against returns predicted \nby the CAPM (panel A) and by the FF \nthree-factor model. In this test, the FF \nmodel provides a clear improvement \nover the CAPM.    \n Notice in panel A that the predicted \nreturns are almost the same for all \nportfolios. This is indeed a weakness \nof tests with portfolios that are sorted \non size and B/M, but not on beta. As a \nresult, all portfolios have betas near 1.0. \nAdding a sort on beta to a 5\u00a0 3 \u00a05 sort \non size and B/M will raise the number \nof portfolios from 25 to 125. This is \nunwieldy. But advances in economet-\nrics and computing power will allow \nthese types of tests to advance.  \n   Size and B/M as Risk Factors \n Liew and Vassalou  23   show that returns \non style portfolios (HML or SMB) \nseem to predict GDP growth, and \nthus may in fact capture some aspects \nof business cycle risk. Each bar in \n Figure\u00a0 13.2  is the average difference \nin the return on the HML or SMB portfolio in years before good GDP growth versus in \nyears with poor GDP growth.

Thus, at least \npart of the size and value premiums may reflect rational rewards for greater risk exposure.   \n Petkova and Zhang  24   also try to tie the average return premium on value (high B/M) \nportfolios to risk premiums. Their approach uses a conditional CAPM. In the conventional \nCAPM, we treat both the market risk premium and firm betas as given parameters. In con-\ntrast, as we noted earlier in the chapter, the conditional CAPM allows both of these terms \nto vary over time, and possibly to co-vary. If a stock\u2019s beta is higher when the market risk \npremium is high, this positive association leads to a \u201csynergy\u201d in its risk premium, which \nis the product of its incremental beta and market risk premium. \n What might lead to such an association between beta and the market risk premium? \nZhang  25   focuses on irreversible investments. He notes that firms classified as value firms \n(with high book-to-market ratios) on average will have greater amounts of tangible capital. \nInvestment irreversibility puts such firms more at risk for economic downturns because \nin a severe recession, they will suffer from excess capacity from assets already in place. \nIn contrast, growth firms are better able to deal with a downturn by deferring investment \nplans. The greater exposure of high book-to-market firms to recessions will result in higher \ndown-market betas. Moreover, some evidence suggests that the market risk premium also \nis higher in down markets, when investors are feeling more economic pressure and anxiety. \n24 Ralitsa Petkova and Lu Zhang, \u201cIs Value Riskier than Growth?\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics   78 (2005), \npp. 187\u2013202. \n25 Lu Zhang, \u201cThe Value Premium,\u201d  Journal of Finance   60 (2005), pp. 67\u2013103. \n Figure 13.2 Difference in return to factor portfolios in year prior to above-average versus  below-average \nGDP growth.

These are:\n   DIV\u00a0 5 \u00a0Market dividend yield.  \n  DEFLT\u00a0 5 \u00a0Default spread on corporate bonds (Baa \u2013 Aaa rates).  \n  TERM\u00a0 5 \u00a0Term structure spread (10-year\u20131-year Treasury rates).  \n  TB\u00a0 5 \u00a01-month T-bill rate.    \n They estimate a first-pass regression, but first substitute these state variables for beta as \nfollows:   \nrHML 5 a 1 brMt 1 ei\n5a1 3b01b1DIV t1b2DEFLT t1b3TERM t1b4TBt4rMt1ei ('''''''''')''''''''''*\n5btda time-varying  beta  \n The strategy is to estimate parameters  b  0  through  b  4  and then fit beta using the values of the \nfour state variables at each date. In this way, they can estimate beta in each period. \n Similarly, one can directly estimate the determinants of a time-varying market risk pre-\nmium, using the same set of state variables:   \nrMkt, t2rft5c01c1DIV t1c2DEFLT t1c3TERM t1c4TBt1et  \n The fitted value from this regression is the estimate of the market risk premium. \n Finally, Petkova and Zhang examine the relationship between beta and the market risk \npremium.

While the covariance between the HML beta and the market \nrisk premium is not sufficient to explain by itself the average return premium on value port-\nfolios, it does suggest that at least part of the explanation may be a rational risk premium.   \n  Behavioral Explanations \n On the other side of the debate, several authors make the case that the value premium is a \nmanifestation of market irrationality. The essence of the argument is that analysts tend to \nextrapolate recent performance too far out into the future, and thus tend to overestimate \nthe value of firms with good recent performance. When the market realizes its mistake, the \nprices of these firms fall. Thus, on average, \u201cglamour firms,\u201d which are characterized by \nrecent good performance, high prices, and lower book-to-market ratios, tend to underper-\nform \u201cvalue firms\u201d because their high prices reflect excessive optimism relative to those \nlower book-to-market firms. \n  Figure\u00a013.4 , from a study by Chan, Karceski, and Lakonishok,  26   makes the case for \noverreaction. Firms are sorted into deciles based on income growth in the past 5 years. By \nconstruction, the growth rates uniformly increase from the first through the tenth decile. \nThe book-to-market ratio for each decile at the  end  of the 5-year period (the dashed line) \ntracks recent growth very well. B/M falls steadily with growth over the past 5 years. This \nis evidence that  past  growth is extrapolated and then impounded in price. High past growth \nleads to higher prices and lower B/M ratios.    \n26 L.K.C. Chan, J. Karceski, and J.

In other words, the firms with lower B/M (glamour \nfirms) experience no better or even worse average future income growth than other firms. \nThe implication is that the market ignores evidence that past growth cannot be extrapolated \nfar into the future. Book-to-market may reflect past growth better than future growth, con-\nsistent with extrapolation error. \n More direct evidence supporting extrapolation error is provided by La Porta, \nLakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny,  27   who examine stock price performance when actual \nearnings are released to the public. Firms are classified as growth versus value stocks, and \nthe stock price performance at earnings announcements for 4 years following the classifi-\ncation date is then examined.  Figure\u00a013.5  demonstrates that growth stocks underperform \nvalue stocks surrounding these announcements. We conclude that when news of actual \nearnings is released to the public, the market is relatively disappointed in stocks it has been \npricing as growth firms.    \n  Momentum: A Fourth Factor \n Since the seminal Fama-French three-factor model was introduced, a fourth factor has \ncome to be added to the standard controls for stock return behavior. This is a momentum \nfactor. As we first saw in Chapter 11, Jegadeesh and Titman uncovered a tendency for \ngood or bad performance of stocks to persist over several months, a sort of momentum \nproperty.  28   Carhart added this momentum effect to the three-factor model as a tool to \n Figure 13.5 Value minus glamour returns surrounding earnings announcements, \n1971\u20131992.

Carhart found that much of what appeared to be the alpha of many mutual funds could in fact be explained as due to their loadings or sensitivities to market momentum. The original Fama-French model augmented with a momentum fac-tor has become a common four-factor model used to evaluate abnormal performance of a stock portfolio.\n \n Of course, this additional factor presents further conundrums of interpretation. To char-\nacterize the original Fama-French factors as reflecting obvious sources of risk is already a bit of a challenge.

In Chapter 9 we saw that an important extension of the CAPM incorporates consider-\nations of asset liquidity. Unfortunately, measuring liquidity is far from trivial. The effect of liquidity on an asset\u2019s expected return is composed of two factors:\n    1. Transaction costs that are dominated by the bid\u2013ask spread that dealers set to com-\npensate for losses incurred when trading with informed traders.  \n   2. Liquidity  risk  resulting from covariance between  changes  in asset liquidity cost \nwith both  changes  in market-index liquidity cost and with market-index rates of \nreturn.    \n Neither of these factors are directly observable and their effect on equilibrium rates of return is difficult to estimate. \n Liquidity embodies several characteristics such as trading costs, ease of sale, necessary \nprice concessions to effect a quick transaction, market depth, and price predictability. As such, it is difficult to measure with any single statistic. Popular measures of liquidity, or, more precisely, illiquidity, focus on the price impact dimension: What price concession might a seller have to offer in order to accomplish a large sale of an asset or, conversely, what premium must a buyer offer to make a large purchase? \n One measure of illiquidity is employed by P\u00e1stor and Stambaugh, who look for evi-\ndence of price reversals, especially following large trades.  \n30   Their idea is that if stock price \nmovements tend to be partially reversed on the following day, then we can conclude that part of the original price change was not due to perceived changes in intrinsic value (these price changes would not tend to be reversed), but was instead a symptom of price impact associated with the original trade. Reversals suggest that part of the original price change was a concession on the part of trade initiators who needed to offer higher purchase prices or accept lower selling prices to complete their trades in a timely manner. P\u00e1stor and Stambaugh use regression analysis to show that reversals do in fact tend to be larger when associated with higher trading volume\u2014exactly the pattern that one would expect if part of the price move is a liquidity phenomenon. They run a first-stage regression of returns on lagged returns and trading volume. The coefficient on the latter term measures the ten-dency of high-volume trades to be accompanied by larger reversals.\n    13.4 Liquidity and Asset Pricing \nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   433bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   433 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n434 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n Another measure of illiquidity, proposed by Amihud, also focuses on the association \nbetween large trades and price movements.  31   His measure is:  \n   I L L I Q5Monthly average of daily cAbsolute value (Stock return )\nDollar volumed  \n This measure of illiquidity is based on the price impact per dollar of transactions in the \nstock and can be used to estimate both liquidity cost and liquidity risk. \n Finally, Sadka uses trade-by-trade data to devise a third measure of liquidity.  32   He \nbegins with the observation that part of price impact, a major component of illiquidity cost, is due to asymmetric information. (Turn back to our discussion of liquidity in Chapter 9 for a review of asymmetric information and the bid\u2013ask spread.) He then uses regression analysis to break out the component of price impact that is due to information issues. The liquidity of firms can wax or wane as the prevalence of informationally motivated trades varies, giving rise to liquidity risk.\n \n Any of these liquidity measures can be averaged over stocks to devise measures of mar-\nketwide illiquidity. Given market illiquidity, we can then measure the \u201cliquidity beta\u201d of any individual stock (the sensitivity of returns to changes in market liquidity) and estimate the impact of liquidity risk on expected return. If stocks with high liquidity betas have higher average returns, we conclude that liquidity is a \u201cpriced factor,\u201d meaning that expo-sure to it offers higher expected return as compensation for the risk. \n P\u00e1stor and Stambaugh conclude that liquidity risk is in fact a priced factor, and that \nthe risk premium associated with it is quantitatively significant. They sort portfolios into deciles based on liquidity beta and then compute the average alphas of the stocks in each decile using two models that  ignore  liquidity: the CAPM and the Fama-French three-factor \nmodel.  Figure\u00a013.6  shows that the alpha computed under either model rises substantially across liquidity-beta deciles, clear evidence that when controlling for other factors, aver-age return rises along with liquidity risk. Not surprisingly, the relationship between liquid-ity risk and alpha across deciles is more regular for the Fama-French model, as it controls for a wider range of other influences on average return.  \n P\u00e1stor and Stambaugh also test the impact of the liquidity beta on alpha computed from \na four-factor model (that also controls for momentum) and obtain similar results  . In fact, they suggest that liquidity risk factor may account for a good part of the apparent profit-ability of the momentum strategy. \n Acharya and Pedersen use Amihud\u2019s measure to test for price effects associated with \nthe average  level  of illiquidity as well as a liquidity risk premium.  \n33   They demonstrate that \nexpected stock returns depend on the average level of illiquidity. ( Figure\u00a09.4  in Chapter 9 shows a similar result.) But Acharya and Pedersen demonstrate that stock returns depend on several liquidity betas as well: the sensitivity of individual stock illiquidity to market illiquidity; the sensitivity of stock returns to market illiquidity; and the sensitivity of stock illiquidity to market return. They conclude that adding these liquidity effects to the conven-tional CAPM increases our ability to explain expected asset returns.   \n  31 Yakov Amihud, \u201cIlliquidity and Stock Returns: Cross-Section and Time-Series Effects,\u201d  Journal of Financial \nMarkets  5 (2002), pp. 31\u201356. \n  32 Ronnie Sadka, \u201cMomentum and Post-earnings Announcement Drift Anomalies: The Role of Liquidity Risk,\u201d \n Journal of Financial Economics  80 (2006), pp. 309\u201349. \n  33 V .

The question of whether past returns \nprovide a guideline to future returns is sufficiently important to justify stretching the scope \nof our discussions of equilibrium in capital markets.    \n   Consumption Growth and Market Rates of Return \n The ICAPM is derived from a lifetime consumption/investment plan of a representative \nconsumer/investor. Each individual\u2019s plan is set to maximize a utility function of lifetime \nconsumption, and consumption/investment in each period is based on age and current \nwealth, as well as the risk-free rate and the market portfolio\u2019s risk and risk premium. \nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   435bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   435 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n436 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\n The consumption model implies that what matters to investors is not their wealth per \nse, but their lifetime flow of consumption. There can be slippage between wealth and con-\nsumption due to variation in factors such as the risk-free rate, the market portfolio risk premium, or prices of major consumption items. Therefore, a better measure of consumer well-being than wealth is the consumption flow that such wealth can support. \n Given this framework, the generalization of the basic CAPM is that instead of measur-\ning security risk based on the covariance of returns with the market return (a measure that focuses only on wealth), we are better off using the covariance of returns with aggregate consumption. Hence, we would expect the risk premium of the market index to be related to that covariance as follows:   \n E(r\nM) 2 r f  5 ACov (r M, rC )  (13.10)   \n where  A  depends on the average coefficient of risk aversion and  r   C   is the rate of return on \na consumption-tracking portfolio constructed to have the highest possible correlation with \ngrowth in aggregate consumption.  35    \n The first wave of attempts to estimate consumption-based asset pricing models used \nconsumption data directly rather than returns on consumption-tracking portfolios. By and large, these tests found the CCAPM no better than the conventional CAPM in explaining risk premiums. The  equity premium puzzle  refers to the fact that using reasonable estimates \nof  A,  the covariance of consumption growth with the market-index return, Cov( r  \n M  ,\u00a0 r   C  ), is \nfar too low to justify observed historical-average excess returns on the market-index port-\nfolio, shown on the left-hand side of Equation 13.10.  36   Thus, the risk premium puzzle says \nin effect that historical excess returns are too high and/or our inferences about risk aversion are too low.\n \n Recent research improves the quality of estimation in several ways. First, rather than \nusing consumption growth directly, it uses consumption-tracking portfolios. The available (infrequent) data on aggregate consumption is used only to construct the consumption-tracking portfolio. The frequent and accurate data on the return on these portfolios may then be used to test the asset pricing model. (On the other hand, any inaccuracy in the construc-tion of the consumption-mimicking portfolios will muddy the relationship between asset returns and consumption risk.) For example, a study by Jagannathan and Wang focuses on year-over-year fourth-quarter consumption and employs a consumption-tracking  portfolio.  \n37    Table\u00a013.5 , excerpted from their study, shows that the Fama-French factors are \nin fact associated with consumption betas as well as excess returns. The top panel contains familiar results: Moving across each row, we see that higher book-to-market ratios are asso-ciated with higher average returns. Similarly, moving down each column, we see that larger size generally implies lower average returns. The novel results are in the lower panel: A high book-to-market ratio is associated with higher consumption beta, and larger firm size is associated with lower consumption beta. The suggestion is that the explanatory power of the Fama-French factors for average returns may in fact reflect differences in consumption \n  35 This equation is analogous to the equation for the risk premium in the conventional CAPM, i.e., that  E ( r   M  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 \nA Cov( r   M  ,\u00a0 r   M  )\u00a0 5 \u00a0 A Var( r   M  ). In the multifactor version of the ICAPM, however, the market is no longer mean-\nvariance efficient, so the risk premium of the market index will not be proportional to its variance. The APT also \nimplies a linear relationship between risk premium and covariance with relevant factors, but it is silent about the slope of the relationship because it avoids assumptions about utility. \n  \n36 Notice that the conventional CAPM does not pose such problems. In the CAPM,  E ( r   M  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 A Var( r   M  ). A risk \npremium of .085 (8.5%) and a standard deviation of .20 (20%, or variance of .04) imply a coefficient of risk aver-\nsion of .085/.04\u00a0 5 \u00a02.125, which is quite plausible. \n  37 Ravi Jagannathan and Yong Wang, \u201cLazy Investors, Discretionary Consumption, and the Cross-Section of \nStock Returns,\u201d  Journal of Finance  62 (August 2006), pp. 1623\u201361. \nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   436bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   436 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 13 Empirical Evidence on Security Returns 437\nrisk of those portfolios.  Figure\u00a013.7  shows \nthat the average returns of the 25 Fama-\nFrench portfolios are strongly associated \nwith their consumption betas. Other tests \nreported by Jagannathan and Wang show \nthat the CCAPM explains returns even \nbetter than the Fama-French three-factor \nmodel, which in turn is superior to the \nsingle-factor CAPM.    \n Moreover, the standard CCAPM fo-\ncuses on a representative consumer/investor, \nthereby ignoring information about hetero-\ngeneous investors with different levels of \nwealth and consumption habits. To improve \nthe model\u2019s power to explain returns, some \nnewer studies allow for several classes of \ninvestors with differences in wealth and \nconsumption behavior. For example, the \ncovariance between market returns and \nconsumption is far higher when we focus \non the consumption risk of households that \nactually hold financial securities.  38   This \nobservation mitigates the equity risk pre-\nmium puzzle.    \nBook-to-Market\nSize Low Medium High\nAverage annual excess returns* (%)\nSmall 6.19 12.24 17.19\nMedium 6.93 10.43 13.94\nBig 7.08  8.52 9.5\nConsumption beta*\nSmall 3.46  4.26 5.94\nMedium 2.88  4.35 5.71\nBig 3.39  2.83 4.41 Table 13.5 \n Annual excess returns and \nconsumption betas \n  *Average annual excess returns on the 25 Fama-French portfolios from 1954 to 2003. \nConsumption betas estimated by the time series regression   \n  Ri,t\u00a05\u00a0ai\u00a01\u00a0bi,cgct\u00a01\u00a0ei,t ,\n where  R   i,  t   is the excess return over the risk-free rate, and  g   ct   is annual consumption growth \ncalculated using fourth-quarter consumption data.  \n Source: Ravi Jagannathan and Yong Wang, \u201cLazy Investors, Discretionary Consumption, and the \nCross-Section of Stock Returns,\u201d  Journal of Finance   62 (August 2006), pp. 1623\u201361. \n38 C.

They use the constant-growth dividend-discount model (see an introductory finance text or Chapter 18) to estimate expected returns and find that for the period 1872\u20131949, the dividend discount model (DDM) yields similar estimates of the  expected  risk premium as the average  realized  excess return. But for the period 1950\u2013\n1999, the DDM yields a much smaller risk premium, which suggests that the high average excess return in this period may have exceeded the returns investors actually expected to earn at the time. \n In the constant-growth DDM, the expected capital gains rate on the stock will equal the \ngrowth rate of dividends. As a result, the expected total return on the firm\u2019s stock will be the sum of dividend yield (dividend/price) plus the expected dividend growth rate,  g:    \n E(r)5\nD1\nP01g  (13.11)   \n where  D  1  is end-of-year dividends and  P  0  is the current price of the stock. Fama and French \ntreat the S&P 500 as representative of the average firm, and use Equation 13.11 to produce estimates of  E ( r ). \n For any sample period,  t \u00a0 5 \u00a01,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0,\u00a0 T,   Fama and French estimate expected return from the \nsum of the dividend yield ( D  \n t   / P   t \u00a0 2 \u00a01 ) plus the dividend growth rate ( g   t  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 D   t   / D   t \u00a0 2 \u00a01 \u00a0 2 \u00a01). In \ncontrast, the  realized  return is the dividend yield plus the rate of capital gains ( P   t   / P   t \u00a0 2 \u00a01 \u00a0 2 \u00a01). \nBecause the dividend yield is common to both estimates, the difference between the \nexpected and realized return equals the difference between the dividend growth and capital gains rates. While dividend growth and capital gains were similar in the earlier period, cap-ital gains significantly exceeded the dividend growth rate in modern times. Hence, Fama and French conclude that the equity premium puzzle may be due at least in part to unan-ticipated capital gains in the latter period. \n Fama and French argue that dividend growth rates produce more reliable estimates of \nthe capital gains investors actually expected to earn than the average of their realized capi-tal gains. They point to three reasons:\n    1. Average realized returns over 1950\u20131999 exceeded the internal rate of return on \ncorporate investments. If those average returns were representative of expectations, we would have to conclude that firms were willingly engaging in negative-NPV investments.  \n  39 Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, \u201cThe Equity Premium,\u201d  Journal of Finance  57, no. 2 (2002). \nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   438bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   438 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 13 Empirical Evidence on Security Returns 439\n   2. The statistical precision of estimates from the DDM are far higher than those using \naverage historical returns. The standard error of the estimates of the risk premium \nfrom realized returns greatly exceed the standard error from the dividend discount model (see the following table).  \n   3. The reward-to-volatility (Sharpe) ratio derived from the DDM is far more stable \nthan that derived from realized returns. If risk aversion remains the same over time, we would expect the Sharpe ratio to be stable.    \n The evidence for the second and third points is shown in the following table, where \nestimates from the dividend discount model (DDM) and from realized returns (Realized) are shown side by side.   \nMean Return Standard Error t-Statistic Sharpe Ratio\nPeriod DDM Realized DDM Realized DDM Realized DDM Realized\n1872\u20131999 4.03 6.10 1.14 1.65 3.52 3.70 0.22 0.34\n1872\u20131949 4.35 4.62 1.76 2.20 2.47 2.10 0.23 0.24\n1950\u20131999 3.54 8.41 1.03 2.45 3.42 3.43 0.21 0.51\n Fama and French\u2019s study provides a simple explanation for the equity premium puzzle, \nnamely, that observed rates of return in the recent half-century were unexpectedly high. It also implies that forecasts of future excess returns will be lower than past averages. (Coincidentally, their study was published in 1999, and so far appears prophetic in light of low subsequent average returns since then.) \n Work by Goetzmann and Ibbotson lends support to Fama and French\u2019s argument.  \n40   \nGoetzmann and Ibbotson combine research that extends data on rates of return on stocks and long-term corporate bonds back to 1792. Summary statistics for these values between 1792 and 1925 are as follows:\n    \nArithmetic Average Geometric Average Standard Deviation\nNYSE total return 7.93% 6.99% 14.64%\nU.S. bond yields 4.17% 4.16%  4.17%\n These statistics suggest a risk premium that is much lower than the historical aver-\nage for 1926\u20132009 (much less 1950\u20131999), which is the period that produces the equity premium puzzle.  \n41   Thus, the period for which Fama and French claim realized rates were \nunexpected is actually relatively short in historical perspective.   \n  Survivorship Bias \n The equity premium puzzle emerged from long-term averages of U.S. stock returns. There are reasons to suspect that these estimates of the risk premium are subject to survivorship bias, as the United States has arguably been the most successful capitalist system in the world, an outcome that probably would not have been anticipated several decades ago. \n  40 William N. Goetzmann and Roger G. Ibbotson, \u201cHistory and the Equity Risk Premium,\u201d working paper, Yale \nUniversity, October 18, 2005. \n  41 The short-term risk-free rate is a lot more difficult to assess because short-term bonds in this period were quite \nrisky and average rates exceeded the yields on long-term corporate bonds. \nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   439bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   439 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 4 0 PART III  Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nJurion and Goetzmann assembled a \ndatabase of capital appreciation indexes \nfor the stock markets of 39 countries over \nthe period 1921\u20131996.  42    Figure\u00a013.8  shows \nthat U.S. equities had the highest real return \nof all countries, at 4.3% annually, versus a \nmedian of .8% for other countries. More-\nover, unlike the United States, many other \ncountries have had equity markets that \nactually closed, either permanently or for \nextended periods of time.    \n The implication of these results is that \nusing average U.S. data may impart a \nform of survivorship bias to our estimate \nof expected returns, because unlike many \nother countries, the United States has never \nbeen a victim of such extreme problems. \nEstimating risk premiums from the expe-\nrience of the most successful country and \nignoring the evidence from stock markets \nthat did not survive for the full sample period \nwill impart an upward bias in estimates of \nexpected returns. The high realized equity \npremium obtained for the United States may \nnot be indicative of required returns. \n As an analogy, think of the effect of survivorship bias in the mutual fund industry. \nWe know that some companies regularly close down their worst-performing mutual funds. \nIf performance studies include only mutual funds for which returns are available during an \nentire sample period, the average returns of the funds that make it into the sample will be \nreflective of the performance of long-term survivors only. With the failed funds excluded \nfrom the sample, the average measured performance of mutual fund managers will be bet-\nter than one could reasonably expect from the full sample of managers. Think back to the \nbox in Chapter 11, \u201cHow to Guarantee a Successful Market Newsletter.\u201d If one starts many \nnewsletters with a range of forecasts, and continues only the newsletters that turned out to \nhave successful advice, then it will  appear   from the sample of survivors that the average \nnewsletter had forecasting skill.  \n  Extensions to the CAPM May Resolve the Equity Premium Puzzle \n Constantinides argues that the standard CAPM can be extended to account for observed \nexcess returns by relaxing some of its assumptions, in particular, by recognizing that con-\nsumers face uninsurable and idiosyncratic income shocks, for example, the loss of employ-\nment.  43   The prospect of such events is higher in economic downturns and this observation \ntakes us a long way toward understanding the means and variances of asset returns as well \nas their variation along the business cycle.  \n In addition, life-cycle considerations are important and often overlooked.

Young consumers, however, do face meaningful borrowing con-straints. Constantinides traces their impact on the equity premium, the demand for bonds, and on the limited participation of many consumers in the capital markets. Finally, he shows that adding habit formation to the conventional utility function helps explain higher risk premiums than those that would be justified by the covariance of stock returns with aggregate consumption growth. He argues that integrating the notions of habit formation, incomplete markets, the life cycle, borrowing constraints, and other sources of limited stock market participation is a promising vantage point from which to study the prices of assets and their returns, both theoretically and empirically within the class of rational asset-pricing models.  \n  Liquidity and the Equity Premium Puzzle \n We\u2019ve seen that liquidity risk is potentially important in explaining the cross section of stock returns. The illiquidity premium may be on the same order of magnitude as the mar-ket risk premium. Therefore, the common practice of treating the average excess return on a market index as an estimate of a risk premium per se is almost certainly too simplistic. Part of that average excess return is almost certainly compensation for  liquidity  risk rather \nthan just the (systematic)  volatility  of returns. If this is recognized, the equity premium \npuzzle may be less of a puzzle than it first appears.  \n  Behavioral Explanations of the Equity Premium Puzzle \n Barberis and Huang explain the puzzle as an outcome of irrational investor behavior.  44   \nThe key elements of their approach are loss aversion and narrow framing, two well-known features of decision making under risk in experimental settings. Narrow framing is the idea that investors evaluate every risk they face in isolation. Thus, investors will ignore low correlation of the risk of a stock portfolio with other components of wealth, and therefore require a higher risk premium than rational models would predict. Combined with loss aversion, investor behavior will generate large risk premiums despite the fact that traditionally measured risk aversion is low. (See Chapter 12 for more discussion of such behavioral biases.)\n  \n Models that incorporate these effects can generate a large equilibrium equity risk pre-\nmium and a low and stable risk-free rate, even when consumption growth is smooth and only weakly correlated with the stock market. Moreover, they can do so for parameter values that correspond to plausible predictions about attitudes to independent monetary gambles. The analysis for the equity premium also has implications for a closely related portfolio puzzle, the stock market participation puzzle. They suggest some possible direc-tions for future research. \n The approach of Barberis and Huang, when accounting for heterogeneity of prefer-\nences, can explain why a segment of the population that one would expect to participate in the stock market still avoids it. Narrow framing also explains the disconnect between consumption growth and market rates of return. The assessment of stock market return in isolation ignores the limited impact on consumption via smoothing and other hedges. Loss aversion that exaggerates disutility of losses relative to a reference point magnifies this effect. The development of empirical literature on the tenets of these theories may deter-mine the validity and implications of the equity premium puzzle.     \n  44 Nicholas Barberis and Ming Huang, \u201cThe Loss Aversion/Narrow Framing Approach to the Equity Premium \nPuzzle,\u201d in  Handbooks in Finance: Handbook of the Equity Risk Premium  ed.

Although the single-factor expected return\u2013beta relationship has not been confirmed by scientific \nstandards, its use is already commonplace in economic life.  \n    2 .   Early tests of the single-factor CAPM rejected the SML, finding that nonsystematic risk was related to average security returns.  \n    3 .   Later tests controlling for the measurement error in beta found that nonsystematic risk does not explain portfolio returns but also that the estimated SML is too flat compared with what the CAPM would predict.  \n    4 .   Roll\u2019s critique implied that the usual CAPM test is a test only of the mean-variance efficiency of a prespecified market  proxy  and therefore that tests of the linearity of the expected return\u2013beta \nrelationship do not bear on the validity of the model.  \n    5 .   Tests of the mean-variance efficiency of professionally managed portfolios against the bench-mark of a prespecified market index conform with Roll\u2019s critique in that they provide evidence on the efficiency of the market index.       Empirical evidence suggests that most professionally man-aged portfolios are outperformed by market indexes, which corroborates the efficiency of those indexes and hence the CAPM.  \n    6 .   Tests of the single-index model that account for human capital and cyclical variations in asset betas are far more consistent with the single-index CAPM and APT. These tests suggest that extra-market macroeconomic variables are not necessary to explain expected returns. Moreover, anomalies such as effects of size and book-to-market ratios disappear once these variables are accounted for. \n     7 .   The dominant multifactor models today are variants of the Fama-French model, incorporating market, size, value, momentum, and sometimes liquidity factors. Debate continues on whether returns associated with these extra-market factors reflect rational risk premia or behaviorally induced mispricing.  \n    8 .   The equity premium puzzle originates from the observation that equity returns exceeded the risk-free rate to an extent that is inconsistent with reasonable levels of risk aversion\u2014at least when average rates of return are taken to represent expectations. Fama and French show that the puzzle emerges primarily from excess returns over the last 50 years. Alternative estimates of expected returns using the dividend growth model instead of average returns suggest that excess returns on stocks were high because of unexpected large capital gains. The study suggests that future excess returns will be lower than realized in recent decades.  \n    9 .   Early research on consumption-based capital asset pricing models was disappointing, but more recent work is far more encouraging. In some studies, consumption betas explain average port-folio returns as well as the Fama-French three-factor model. These results support Fama and French\u2019s conjecture that their factors proxy for more fundamental sources of risk.

Identify and briefly discuss three criticisms of beta as used in the capital asset pricing model.  \n   2. Richard Roll, in an article on using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to evaluate portfolio \nperformance, indicated that it may not be possible to evaluate portfolio management ability if \nthere is an error in the benchmark used.\n     a.  In evaluating portfolio performance, describe the general procedure, with emphasis on the \nbenchmark employed.  \n    b .  Explain what Roll meant by the benchmark error and identify the specific problem with this \nbenchmark.  \n    c.  Draw a graph that shows how a portfolio that has been judged as superior relative to a \u201cmea-\nsured\u201d security market line (SML) can be inferior relative to the \u201ctrue\u201d SML.  \n    d.  Assume that you are informed that a given portfolio manager has been evaluated as superior \nwhen compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the NYSE Composite \nIndex. Explain whether this consensus would make you feel more comfortable regarding the \nportfolio manager\u2019s true ability.  \n    e.  Although conceding the possible problem with benchmark errors as set forth by Roll, some \ncontend this does not mean the CAPM is incorrect, but only that there is a measurement \nproblem when implementing the theory. Others contend that because of benchmark errors the \nwhole technique should be scrapped. Take and defend one of these positions.     \n   3. Bart Campbell, CFA, is a portfolio manager who has recently met with a prospective client, Jane \nBlack. After conducting a survey market line (SML) performance analysis using the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average as her market proxy, Black claims that her portfolio has experienced supe-\nrior performance. Campbell uses the capital asset pricing model as an investment performance \nmeasure and finds that Black\u2019s portfolio plots below the SML. Campbell concludes that Black\u2019s \napparent superior performance is a function of an incorrectly specified market proxy, not superior \ninvestment management. Justify Campbell\u2019s conclusion by addressing the likely effects of an \nincorrectly specified market proxy on both beta and the slope of the SML.    \n  SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS \n    1. The SCL is estimated for each stock; hence we need to estimate 100 equations. Our sample \nconsists of 60 monthly rates of return for each of the 100 stocks and for the market index. Thus \neach regression is estimated with 60 observations. Equation 13.1 in the text shows that when \nstated in excess return form, the SCL should pass through the origin, that is, have a zero intercept.  \n   2. When the SML has a positive intercept and its slope is less than the mean excess return on the market \nportfolio, it is flatter than predicted by the CAPM. Low-beta stocks therefore have yielded returns \nthat, on average, were higher than they should have been on the basis of their beta. Conversely, high-\nbeta stocks were found to have yielded, on average, lower returns than they should have on the basis \nof their betas. The positive coefficient on  g  2  implies that stocks with higher values of firm-specific \nrisk had on average higher returns. This pattern, of course, violates the predictions of the CAPM.  \n   3 .     a.   According to Equation 13.5,  g  0  is the average return earned on a stock with zero beta and zero \nfirm-specific risk. According to the CAPM, this should be the risk-free rate, which for the \n1946\u20131955 period was 9 basis points, or .09% per month (see  Table 13.1 ). According to the \nCAPM,  g  1  should equal the average market risk premium, which for the 1946\u20131955 period \nwas 103 basis points, or 1.03% per month. Finally, the CAPM predicts that  g  3 , the coefficient \non firm-specific risk, should be zero.  \n  b . A positive coefficient on beta-squared would indicate that the relationship between risk and \nreturn is nonlinear. High-beta securities would provide expected returns more than proportional \nto risk. A positive coefficient on  s ( e ) would indicate that firm-specific risk affects expected \nreturn, a direct contradiction of the CAPM and APT.        \nbod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   444bod61671_ch13_414-444.indd   444 7/17/13   3:47 PM7/17/13   3:47 PMFinal PDF to printer\n   14\n  IN THE PREVIOUS\u00a0 chapters on risk and return \nrelationships, we treated securities at a high \nlevel of abstraction. We assumed implicitly that a prior, detailed analysis of each security already had been performed, and that its risk and return features had been assessed. \n We turn now to specific analyses of partic-\nular security markets. We examine valuation \nprinciples, determinants of risk and return, and portfolio strategies commonly used within and across the various markets. \n We begin by analyzing    debt securities    .  A \ndebt security is a claim on a specified periodic \nstream of income. Debt securities are often called  fixed-income securities  because they \npromise either a fixed stream of income or one that is determined according to a speci-fied formula. These securities have the advan-tage of being relatively easy to understand because the payment formulas are specified in advance. Uncertainty about their cash flows is minimal as long as the issuer of the secu-rity is sufficiently creditworthy. That makes these securities a convenient starting point for our analysis of the universe of potential  investment vehicles. \n The bond is the basic debt security, and \nthis chapter starts with an overview of the \nuniverse of bond markets, including Treasury, corporate, and international bonds. We turn next to bond pricing, showing how bond prices are set in accordance with market interest rates and why bond prices change with those rates. Given this background, we can compare the myriad measures of bond returns such as yield to maturity, yield to call, holding-period return, and realized com-pound rate of return. We show how bond prices evolve over time, discuss certain tax rules that apply to debt securities, and show how to calculate after-tax returns. Finally, we consider the impact of default or credit risk on bond pricing and look at the determinants of credit risk and the default premium built into bond yields. Credit risk is central to both collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps, so we examine these instru-ments as well.

The bor-\nrower issues (i.e., sells) a bond to the lender for some amount of cash; the bond is the \n\u201cIOU\u201d of the borrower. The arrangement obligates the issuer to make specified payments \nto the bondholder on specified dates. A typical coupon bond obligates the issuer to make \nsemiannual payments of interest to the bondholder for the life of the bond. These are called \ncoupon payments   because in precomputer days, most bonds had coupons that investors \nwould clip off and present to claim the interest payment. When the bond matures, the issuer \nrepays the debt by paying the bond\u2019s    par value    (equivalently, its    face value   ). The    coupon \nrate    of the bond determines the interest payment: The annual payment is the coupon rate \ntimes the bond\u2019s par value. The coupon rate, maturity date, and par value of the bond are \npart of the    bond indenture    ,  which is the contract between the issuer and the bondholder. \n To illustrate, a bond with par value of $1,000 and coupon rate of 8% might be sold to a \nbuyer for $1,000. The bondholder is then entitled to a payment of 8% of $1,000, or $80 per \nyear, for the stated life of the bond, say, 30 years. The $80 payment typically comes in two \nsemiannual installments of $40 each. At the end of the 30-year life of the bond, the issuer \nalso pays the $1,000 par value to the bondholder. \n Bonds usually are issued with coupon rates set just high enough to induce investors to \npay par value to buy the bond. Sometimes, however,    zero-coupon bonds    are issued that \nmake no coupon payments. In this case, investors receive par value at the maturity date but \nreceive no interest payments until then: The bond has a coupon rate of zero. These bonds \nare issued at prices considerably below par value, and the investor\u2019s return comes solely \nfrom the difference between issue price and \nthe payment of par value at maturity. We will \nreturn to these bonds later.  \n   Treasury Bonds and Notes \n  Figure\u00a014.1  is an excerpt from the listing of \nTreasury issues. Treasury notes are issued \nwith original maturities ranging between 1 \nand 10 years, while Treasury bonds are issued \nwith maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. \nBoth bonds and notes may be purchased \ndirectly from the Treasury in denominations \nof only $100, but denominations of $1,000 \nare far more common. Both make semiannual \ncoupon payments.  \n The highlighted bond in  Figure\u00a0 14.1  \nmatures on July 31, 2018. Its coupon rate is \n2.25%. Par value typically is $1,000; thus the \nbond pays interest of $22.50 per year in two \nsemiannual payments of $11.25. Payments \nare made in January and July of each year. \nAlthough bonds usually are sold in denomi-\nnations of $1,000, the bid and ask prices \nare quoted as a percentage of par value.  1U.S. Treasury Quotes\nMATURITY\nJun  15 13\nJan  15 15\nJun  30 16\nJul   31 18\nNov 15 18\nFeb  15 21\nFeb  15 26\nMay 15 30\nFeb  15 36\nMay 15 42COUPON\n1.125\n0.250\n1.500\n2.250\n9.000\n7.875\n6.000\n6.250\n4.500\n3.000BID\n100.8203\n100.0391\n104.1563\n108.4922\n150.3750\n154.2344\n149.1484\n160.2190\n138.4063\n108.8047ASKED\n100.8281\n100.0469\n104.1875\n108.5391\n150.4219\n154.3281\n149.2266\n161.0000\n138.4844\n108.8672CHANGE\n0.0078\n0.0547\n0.1016\n0.0938\n0.1719\n0.1875\n0.1484\n0.0781\n0.1641\n0.1328ASKED\nYIELD (%)\n0.177\n0.231\n0.421\n0.790\n0.770\n1.172\n1.869\n2.117\n2.362\n2.572\n Figure 14.1 Prices and yields of U.S. Treasury bonds\n   Source:  The Wall Street Journal Online,   July 31, 2012.

The ask price, which is slightly \nhigher, is the price at which you can buy the bond from a dealer.  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   446bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   446 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 447\nTherefore, the ask price is 108.5391% of par, or $1,085.391. The minimum price \nincrement, or tick size, in  The Wall Street Journal  listing is 1/128, so this bond may also be \nviewed as selling for 108 69\u2044128     percent of par value.  2   \n The last column, labeled \u201cAsk yield,\u201d is the yield to maturity on the bond based on the \nask price. The yield to maturity is a measure of the average rate of return to an investor who purchases the bond for the ask price and holds it until its maturity date. We will have much to say about yield to maturity below. \n  Accrued Interest and Quoted Bond Prices   The bond prices that you see \nquoted in the financial pages are not actually the prices that investors pay for the bond. \nThis is because the quoted price does not include the interest that accrues between coupon payment dates. \n If a bond is purchased between coupon payments, the buyer must pay the seller for \naccrued interest, the prorated share of the upcoming semiannual coupon. For example, if 30 days have passed since the last coupon payment, and there are 182 days in the semian-nual coupon period, the seller is entitled to a payment of accrued interest of 30/182 of the semiannual coupon. The sale, or  invoice,  price of the bond would equal the stated price \n(sometimes called the flat price) plus the accrued interest. \n In general, the formula for the amount of accrued interest between two dates is   \nAccrued interest 5Annual coupon payment\n23Days since last coupon payment\nDays separatin g coupon pa yments  \n Suppose that the coupon rate is 8%. Then the annual coupon is $80 and the semiannual \ncoupon payment is $40. Because 30 days have passed since the last coupon payment, the accrued interest on the bond is $40\u00a0 3 \u00a0(30/182)\u00a0 5 \u00a0$6.59. If the quoted price of the \nbond is $990, then the invoice price will be $990\u00a0 1 \u00a0$6.59\u00a0 5 \u00a0$996.59.  Example 14.1 Accrued Interest \n   2 Bonds traded on formal exchanges are subject to minimum tick sizes set by the exchange. For example, the \nminimum price increment on the 2-year Treasury bond futures contract (traded on the Chicago Board of Trade) is \n1/128, although longer-term T-bonds have larger tick sizes. Private traders can negotiate their own tick size. For example, one can find price quotes on Bloomberg screens with tick sizes as low as 1/256.  \n   \n3 In contrast to bonds, stocks do not trade at flat prices with adjustments for \u201caccrued dividends.\u201d Whoever owns \nthe stock when it goes \u201cex-dividend\u201d receives the entire dividend payment, and the stock price reflects the value \nof the upcoming dividend. The price therefore typically falls by about the amount of the dividend on the \u201cex-day.\u201d There is no need to differentiate between reported and invoice prices for stocks.    The practice of quoting bond prices net of accrued interest explains why the price of \na maturing bond is listed at $1,000 rather than $1,000 plus one coupon payment. A pur-\nchaser of an 8% coupon bond 1 day before the bond\u2019s maturity would receive $1,040 (par value plus semiannual interest) on the following day and so should be willing to pay a total price of $1,040 for the bond. The bond price is quoted net of accrued interest in the finan-cial pages and thus appears as $1,000.  \n3     \n  Corporate Bonds \n Like the government, corporations borrow money by issuing bonds.  Figure\u00a0 14.2  is a sample of listings for a few actively traded corporate bonds. Although some bonds trade \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   447bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   447 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 4 8 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\nelectronically on the NYSE Bonds platform, most bonds are traded over-the-counter in \na network of bond dealers linked by a computer quotation system. In practice, the bond \nmarket can be quite \u201cthin,\u201d with few investors interested in trading a particular issue at any \nparticular time.  \n The bond listings in  Figure\u00a014.2  include the coupon, maturity, price, and yield to matu-\nrity of each bond. The \u201crating\u201d column is the estimation of bond safety given by the three \nmajor bond-rating agencies\u2014Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s, and Fitch. Bonds with grada-\ntions of A ratings are safer than those with B ratings or below. As a general rule, safer \nbonds with higher ratings promise lower yields to maturity than other bonds with similar \nmaturities. We will return to this topic toward the end of the chapter. \n  Call Provisions on Corporate Bonds   Some corporate bonds are issued with call \nprovisions allowing the issuer to repurchase the bond at a specified  call price   before the \nmaturity date. For example, if a company issues a bond with a high coupon rate when market \ninterest rates are high, and interest rates later fall, the firm might like to retire the high-coupon \ndebt and issue new bonds at a lower coupon rate to reduce interest payments. This is called \n refunding.      Callable bonds    typically come with a period of call protection, an initial time dur-\ning which the bonds are not callable. Such bonds are referred to as  deferred   callable bonds. \n The option to call the bond is valuable to the firm, \nallowing it to buy back the bonds and refinance at lower \ninterest rates when market rates fall. Of course, the firm\u2019s \nbenefit is the bondholder\u2019s burden. Holders of called \nbonds must forfeit their bonds for the call price, thereby \ngiving up the attractive coupon rate on their original \ninvestment. To compensate investors for this risk, call-\nable bonds are issued with higher coupons and promised \nyields to maturity than noncallable bonds.   \n  Convertible Bonds      Convertible bonds    give bondholders an option to exchange \neach bond for a specified number of shares of common stock of the firm. The  conversion \nratio   is the number of shares for which each bond may be exchanged. Suppose a convert-\nible bond is issued at par value of $1,000 and is convertible into 40 shares of a firm\u2019s  Suppose that Verizon issues two bonds with \nidentical coupon rates and maturity dates. One \nbond is callable, however, whereas the other is \nnot. Which bond will sell at a higher price?

The current stock price is $20 per share, so the option to convert is not profitable \nnow. Should the stock price later rise to $30, however, each bond may be converted prof-itably into $1,200 worth of stock. The  market conversion value  is the current value of \nthe shares for which the bonds may be exchanged. At the $20 stock price, for example, the bond\u2019s conversion value is $800. The  conversion premium  is the excess of the bond \nvalue over its conversion value. If the bond were selling currently for $950, its premium would be $150. \n Convertible bondholders benefit from price appreciation of the company\u2019s stock. \nAgain, this benefit comes at a price: Convertible bonds offer lower coupon rates and stated or promised yields to maturity than do nonconvertible bonds. However, the actual return on the convertible bond may exceed the stated yield to maturity if the option to convert becomes profitable. \n We discuss convertible and callable bonds further in Chapter 20.  \n  Puttable Bonds   While the callable bond gives the issuer the option to extend or retire \nthe bond at the call date, the  extendable  or    put bond    gives this option to the bondholder. \nIf the bond\u2019s coupon rate exceeds current market yields, for instance, the bondholder will \nchoose to extend the bond\u2019s life. If the bond\u2019s coupon rate is too low, it will be optimal not to extend; the bondholder instead reclaims principal, which can be invested at current yields.  \n  Floating-Rate Bonds      Floating-rate bonds    make interest payments that are tied to \nsome measure of current market rates. For example, the rate might be adjusted annually \nto the current T-bill rate plus 2%. If the 1-year T-bill rate at the adjustment date is 4%, the bond\u2019s coupon rate over the next year would then be 6%. This arrangement means that the bond always pays approximately current market rates. \n The major risk involved in floaters has to do with changes in the firm\u2019s financial \nstrength. The yield spread is fixed over the life of the security, which may be many years. If the financial health of the firm deteriorates, then investors will demand a greater yield pre-mium than is offered by the security. In this case, the price of the bond will fall. Although the coupon rate on floaters adjusts to changes in the general level of market interest rates, it does not adjust to changes in the financial condition of the firm.   \n  Preferred Stock \n Although preferred stock strictly speaking is considered to be equity, it often is included in the fixed-income universe. This is because, like bonds, preferred stock promises to pay a specified stream of dividends. However, unlike bonds, the failure to pay the promised dividend does not result in corporate bankruptcy. Instead, the dividends owed simply cumulate, and the common stockholders may not receive any dividends until the preferred stockholders have been paid in full. In the event of bankruptcy, preferred stockholders\u2019 claims to the firm\u2019s assets have lower priority than those of bondholders but higher priority than those of common stockholders. \n Preferred stock commonly pays a fixed dividend. Therefore, it is in effect a perpetuity, \nproviding a level cash flow indefinitely. In contrast, floating-rate preferred stock is much like floating-rate bonds. The dividend rate is linked to a measure of current market interest rates and is adjusted at regular intervals. \n Unlike interest payments on bonds, dividends on preferred stock are not considered \ntax-deductible expenses to the firm. This reduces their attractiveness as a source of capital to issuing firms. On the other hand, there is an offsetting tax advantage to preferred stock. When one corporation buys the preferred stock of another corporation, it pays taxes on only 30% of the dividends received. For example, if the firm\u2019s tax bracket is 35%, and it receives $10,000 in preferred-dividend payments, it will pay taxes on only $3,000 of \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   449bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   449 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n450 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\nthat income: Total taxes owed on the income will be .35\u00a0 3 \u00a0$3,000\u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,050. The firm\u2019s \n effective tax rate on preferred dividends is therefore only .30\u00a0 3 \u00a035%\u00a0 5 \u00a010.5%. Given this \ntax rule, it is not surprising that most preferred stock is held by corporations. \n Preferred stock rarely gives its holders full voting privileges in the firm. However, if \nthe preferred dividend is skipped, the preferred stockholders may then be provided some \nvoting power.  \n  Other Domestic Issuers \n There are, of course, several issuers of bonds in addition to the Treasury and private corpo-rations. For example, state and local governments issue municipal bonds. The outstanding feature of these is that interest payments are tax-free. We examined municipal bonds, the value of the tax exemption, and the equivalent taxable yield of these bonds in Chapter 2. \n Government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Farm Credit \nagencies, and the mortgage pass-through agencies Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac also issue considerable amounts of bonds. These too were reviewed in Chapter 2.  \n  International Bonds \n International bonds are commonly divided into two categories,  foreign bonds  and \n  Eurobonds.  Foreign bonds are issued by a borrower from a country other than the one in which the bond is sold. The bond is denominated in the currency of the country in which it is marketed. For example, if a German firm sells a dollar-denominated bond in the United States, the bond is considered a foreign bond. These bonds are given colorful names based on the countries in which they are marketed. For example, foreign bonds sold in the United States are called  Yankee bonds.  Like other bonds sold in the United States, they are \nregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Yen-denominated bonds sold in Japan by non-Japanese issuers are called  Samurai bonds.  British pound-denominated \nforeign bonds sold in the United Kingdom are called  bulldog bonds.  \n In contrast to foreign bonds, Eurobonds are denominated in one currency, usually that \nof the issuer, but sold in other national markets. For example, the Eurodollar market refers to dollar-denominated bonds sold outside the United States (not just in Europe), although London is the largest market for Eurodollar bonds. Because the Eurodollar market falls outside U.S. jurisdiction, these bonds are not regulated by U.S. federal agencies. Similarly, Euroyen bonds are yen-denominated bonds selling outside Japan, Eurosterling bonds are pound-denominated Eurobonds selling outside the United Kingdom, and so on.  \n  Innovation in the Bond Market \n Issuers constantly develop innovative bonds with unusual features; these issues illustrate that bond design can be extremely flexible. Here are examples of some novel bonds. They should give you a sense of the potential variety in security design. \n  Inverse Floaters   These are similar to the floating-rate bonds we described earlier, \nexcept that the coupon rate on these bonds  falls  when the general level of interest rates \nrises. Investors in these bonds suffer doubly when rates rise. Not only does the present \nvalue of each dollar of cash flow from the bond fall as the discount rate rises, but the level of those cash flows falls as well. Of course, investors in these bonds benefit doubly when rates fall.  \n  Asset-Backed Bonds   Miramax once issued bonds with coupon rates tied to the finan-\ncial performance of  Pulp Fiction  and other films. Domino\u2019s Pizza has issued bonds with \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   450bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   450 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 451\npayments backed by revenues from its pizza franchises. These are examples of asset-backed \nsecurities. The income from a specified group of assets is used to service the debt. More \nconventional asset-backed securities are mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by \nauto or credit card loans, as we discussed in Chapter 2.  \n  Catastrophe Bonds   Oriental Land Company, which manages Tokyo Disneyland, \nissued a bond in 1999 with a final payment that depended on whether there had been an \nearthquake near the park. More recently, FIFA (the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Foot-\nball Association) issued catastrophe bonds with payments that would be halted if terror-\nism forced the cancellation of the 2006 World Cup. These bonds are a way to transfer \n\u201ccatastrophe risk\u201d from the firm to the capital markets. Investors in these bonds receive \ncompensation for taking on the risk in the form of higher coupon rates. But in the event \nof a catastrophe, the bondholders will give up all or part of their investments. \u201cDisaster\u201d \ncan be defined by total insured losses or by criteria such as wind speed in a hurricane or \nRichter level in an earthquake. Issuance of catastrophe bonds has grown in recent years \nas insurers have sought ways to spread their risks across a wider spectrum of the capital \nmarket.  \n  Indexed Bonds   Indexed bonds make payments that are tied to a general price index \nor the price of a particular commodity. For example, Mexico has issued bonds with pay-\nments that depend on the price of oil. Some bonds are indexed to the general price level. \nThe United States Treasury started issuing such inflation-indexed bonds in January 1997. \nThey are called Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). By tying the par value of \nthe bond to the general level of prices, coupon payments as well as the final repayment of \npar value on these bonds increase in direct proportion to the Consumer Price Index. There-\nfore, the interest rate on these bonds is a risk-free real rate. \n To illustrate how TIPS work, consider a newly issued bond with a 3-year maturity, par \nvalue of $1,000, and a coupon rate of 4%. For simplicity, we will assume the bond makes \nannual coupon payments. Assume that inflation turns out to be 2%, 3%, and 1% in the \nnext 3 years.  Table\u00a014.1  shows how the bond cash flows will be calculated. The first pay-\nment comes at the end of the first year, at  t \u00a0 5 \u00a01. Because inflation over the year was 2%, \nthe par value of the bond increases from $1,000 to $1,020; because the coupon rate is 4%, \nthe coupon payment is 4% of this amount, or $40.80. Notice that par value increases by the \ninflation rate, and because the coupon payments are 4% of par, they too increase in propor-\ntion to the general price level. Therefore, the cash flows paid by the bond are fixed in  real  \nterms. When the bond matures, the investor receives a final coupon payment of $42.44 plus \nthe (price-level-indexed) repayment of principal, $1,061.11.  4    \n Table 14.1 \n Principal and interest \npayments for a Treasury \nInflation Protected \nSecurity   Time    Inflation in Year \nJust Ended    Par Value    Coupon \nPayment      1      Principal \nRepayment      5      Total Payment  \n 0  $1,000.00 \n 1     2%  1,020.00  $40.80    $     0    $ 40.80 \n 2  3  1,050.60   42.02       0    42.02 \n 3  1  1,061.11   42.44    1,061.11    1,103.55 \n4 By the way, total nominal income (i.e., coupon plus that year\u2019s increase in principal) is treated as taxable income \nin each year.  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   451bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   451 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n452 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n The  nominal  rate of return on the bond in the first year is   \nNominal return 5Interest 1Price appreciation\nInitial price540.80120\n1,00056.08%  \n The real rate of return is precisely the 4% real yield on the bond:   \nReal return 511Nominal return\n11Inflation2151.0608\n1.02215.04, or 4%  \n One can show in a similar manner (see Problem 18 in the end-of-chapter problems) that \nthe rate of return in each of the 3 years is 4% as long as the real yield on the bond remains constant. If real yields do change, then there will be capital gains or losses on the bond. In mid-2013, the real yield on long-term TIPS bonds was less than 0.5%.     \n   14.2 Bond Pricing \n  Because a bond\u2019s coupon and principal repayments all occur months or years in the future, the price an investor would be willing to pay for a claim to those payments depends on the value of dollars to be received in the future compared to dollars in hand today. This \u201cpres-ent value\u201d calculation depends in turn on market interest rates. As we saw in Chapter\u00a05, the nominal risk-free interest rate equals the sum of (1) a real risk-free rate of return and (2) a premium above the real rate to compensate for expected inflation. In addition, because most bonds are not riskless, the discount rate will embody an additional premium that reflects bond-specific characteristics such as default risk, liquidity, tax attributes, call risk, and so on. \n We simplify for now by assuming there is one interest rate that is appropriate for \n discounting cash flows of any maturity, but we can relax this assumption easily. In prac-tice, there may be different discount rates for cash flows accruing in different periods. For the time being, however, we ignore this refinement. \n To value a security, we discount its expected cash flows by the appropriate discount \nrate. The cash flows from a bond consist of coupon payments until the maturity date plus the final payment of par value. Therefore,   \nBond value\u00a05\u00a0Present value of coupons\u00a01\u00a0Present value of par value  \n If we call the maturity date  T  and call the interest rate  r,  the bond value can be written as   \n Bond value5a\nT\nt51Coupon\n(11r)t1Par value\n(11r)T  (14.1)   \n The summation sign in Equation 14.1 directs us to add the present value of each coupon payment; each coupon is discounted based on the time until it will be paid. The first term on the right-hand side of Equation 14.1 is the present value of an annuity. The second term is the present value of a single amount, the final payment of the bond\u2019s par value. \n You may recall from an introductory finance class that the present value of a $1 annuity \nthat lasts for  T  periods when the interest rate equals  r  is    1\nr B121\n(11r)TR.

Therefore, we can write the price of the bond as   \n Price5Coupon 31\nr B121\n(11r)TR1Par value 31\n(11r)T\n  5Coupon 3Annuit y factor (r, T)1Par value 3PV factor (r, T)  (14.2)    \n We discussed earlier an 8% coupon, 30-year maturity bond with par value of $1,000 \n paying 60 semiannual coupon payments of $40 each. Suppose that the interest rate is 8% \nannually, or  r \u00a0 5 \u00a04% per 6-month period. Then the value of the bond can be written as   \n Price5a60\nt51$40\n(1.04 )t1$1,000\n(1.04 )60\n  5$403Annuit y factor (4%, 60 )1$1,0003PV factor (4%, 60 )  (14.3)\n   \n It is easy to confirm that the present value of the bond\u2019s 60 semiannual coupon pay-\nments of $40 each is $904.94 and that the $1,000 final payment of par value has a \npresent value of $95.06, for a total bond value of $1,000. You can calculate the value directly from Equation 14.2, perform these calculations on any financial calculator (see Example 14.3 below), use a spreadsheet program (see the Excel Applications box), or use a set of present value tables. \n In this example, the coupon rate equals the market interest rate, and the bond price \nequals par value. If the interest rate were not equal to the bond\u2019s coupon rate, the bond \nwould not sell at par value. For example, if the interest rate were to rise to 10% (5% per 6 months), the bond\u2019s price would fall by $189.29 to $810.71, as follows:   \n  $40\u00a03\u00a0Annuity factor(5%, 60)\u00a01\u00a0$1,000\u00a03\u00a0PV factor(5%, 60) \n  5 $757.17\u00a01\u00a0$53.54\u00a05\u00a0$810.71   \n At a higher interest rate, the present value of the payments to be received by the \nbondholder is lower. Therefore, bond prices fall as market interest rates rise. This illus-\ntrates a crucial general rule in bond valuation.  \n6    Example 14.2 Bond Pricing \n   5 Here is a quick derivation of the formula for the present value of an annuity. An annuity lasting  T  periods can be \nviewed as equivalent to a perpetuity whose first payment comes at the end of the current period  less  another per-\npetuity whose first payment comes at the end of the ( T \u00a0 1 \u00a01)  st   period. The immediate perpetuity net of the delayed \nperpetuity provides exactly  T  payments. We know that the value of a $1 per period perpetuity is $1/ r.  Therefore, \nthe present value of the delayed perpetuity is $1/ r  discounted for  T  additional periods, or    1\nr31\n(11r)T.  \nThe present value of the annuity is the present value of the first perpetuity minus the present value of the delayed \nperpetuity, or    1\nr B121\n(11r)TR.   \n   6 Here is a trap to avoid. You should not confuse the bond\u2019s  coupon  rate, which determines the interest paid to the \nbondholder, with the market interest rate. Once a bond is issued, its coupon rate is fixed. When the  market  interest \nrate increases, investors discount any fixed payments at a higher discount rate, which implies that present values \nand bond prices fall.  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   453bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   453 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n454 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n   Bond prices are tedious to calculate without a spreadsheet or a financial calculator, \nbut they are easy to calculate with either. Financial calculators designed with present and \nfuture value formulas already programmed can greatly simplify calculations of the sort we just encountered in Example 14.2. The basic financial calculator uses five keys that cor-respond to the inputs for time-value-of-money problems such as bond pricing:\n    1 .   n  is the number of time periods. In the case of a bond,  n  equals the number of \nperiods until the bond matures. If the bond makes semiannual payments,  n  is the \nnumber of half-year periods or, equivalently, the number of semiannual coupon payments. For example, if the bond has 10 years until maturity, you would enter 20 for  n,  since each payment period is one-half year.  \n   2.  i  is the interest rate per period, expressed as a percentage (not as a decimal). For \nexample, if the interest rate is 6%, you would enter 6, not .06.  \n   3.  PV  is the present value. Many calculators require that PV be entered as a negative \nnumber, in recognition of the fact that purchase of the bond is a cash  outflow,  while \nthe receipt of coupon payments and face value are cash  inflows.   \n   4.  FV  is the future value or face value of the bond. In general, FV is interpreted as \na one-time future payment of a cash flow, which, for bonds, is the face (i.e., par) value.  \n   5.  PMT  is the amount of any recurring payment. For coupon bonds, PMT is the cou-\npon payment; for zero-coupon bonds, PMT will be zero.    \n Given any four of these inputs, the calculator will solve for the fifth. We can illustrate with the bond in Example 14.2. \n To find the bond\u2019s price when the annual market interest rate is 8%, you would enter \nthese inputs (in any order):   \n    n      60      The bond has a maturity of 30 years, so it makes 60 semian-\nnual payments.  \n   i      4     The  semiannual  market interest rate is 4%.  \n  FV     1,000      The bond will provide a one-time cash flow of $1,000 when \nit matures.  \n  PMT     40     Each semiannual coupon payment is $40.   \n On most calculators, you now punch the \u201ccompute\u201d key (labeled  COMP  or  CPT ) and \nthen enter PV to obtain the bond price, that is the present value today of the bond\u2019s \ncash flows. If you do this, you should find a value of  2 1,000. The negative sign signifies \nthat while the investor receives cash flows from the bond, the price paid to  buy  the bond \nis a cash  out flow, or a negative cash flow. \n If you want to find the value of the bond when the interest rate is 10% (the second \npart of Example 14.2), just enter 5% for the semiannual interest rate (type \u201c5\u201d and \nthen \u201c i \u201d), and when you compute PV, you will find that it is  2 810.71.  Example 14.3 Bond Pricing on a Financial Calculator \n   Figure\u00a014.3  shows the price of the 30-year, 8% coupon bond for a range of interest rates, \nincluding 8%, at which the bond sells at par, and 10%, at which it sells for $810.71. The \nnegative slope illustrates the inverse relationship between prices and yields. The shape of the curve in  Figure\u00a014.3  implies that an increase in the interest rate results in a price \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   454bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   454 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 455\ndecline that is smaller than the price gain resulting from a decrease of equal magnitude \nin the interest rate. This property of bond prices is called  convexity   because of the convex \nshape of the bond price curve. This curvature reflects the fact that progressive increases in \nthe interest rate result in progressively smaller reductions in the bond price.  7   Therefore, the \nprice curve becomes flatter at higher interest rates. We return to convexity in Chapter 16.    \n05 8 1 0 1 5 2 0\nInterest Rate (%)Bond Price ($)\n0500810.711,0001,5002,0002,5003,0003,5004,000\n Figure 14.3 The inverse relationship between bond prices \nand yields. Price of an 8% coupon bond with 30-year \nmaturity making semiannual payments  \n7 The progressively smaller impact of interest increases results largely from the fact that at higher rates the bond \nis worth less. Therefore, an additional increase in rates operates on a smaller initial base, resulting in a smaller \nprice decline.  Calculate the price of the 30-year, 8% coupon bond for a market interest rate of 3% per half-year. \nCompare the capital gains for the interest rate decline to the losses incurred when the rate increases to 5%.  CONCEPT CHECK 14.2 \n Corporate bonds typically are issued at \npar value. This means that the underwriters \nof the bond issue (the firms that market the \nbonds to the public for the issuing corpora-\ntion) must choose a coupon rate that very \nclosely approximates market yields. In a \nprimary issue, the underwriters attempt to \nsell the newly issued bonds directly to their \ncustomers. If the coupon rate is inadequate, \ninvestors will not pay par value for the \nbonds. \n After the bonds are issued, bondholders \nmay buy or sell bonds in secondary mar-\nkets. In these markets, bond prices fluctuate \ninversely with the market interest rate. \n The inverse relationship between price \nand yield is a central feature of fixed-\nincome securities. Interest rate fluctuations \nrepresent the main source of risk in the \nfixed-income market, and we devote con-\nsiderable attention in Chapter 16 to assess-\ning the sensitivity of bond prices to market yields. For now, however, we simply highlight \none key factor that determines that sensitivity, namely, the maturity of the bond. \n As a general rule, keeping all other factors the same, the longer the maturity of the \nbond, the greater the sensitivity of price to fluctuations in the interest rate. For example, \nconsider  Table\u00a014.2 , which presents the price of an 8% coupon bond at different market \nyields and times to maturity. For any departure of the interest rate from 8% (the rate \nat which the bond sells at par value), the change in the bond price is greater for longer \ntimes to maturity.  \n This makes sense. If you buy the bond at par with an 8% coupon rate, and market \nrates subsequently rise, then you suffer a loss: You have tied up your money earning 8% \nwhen alternative investments offer higher returns. This is reflected in a capital loss on \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   455bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   455 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 5 6 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\nthe bond\u2014a fall in its market price. The longer the period for which your money is tied \nup, the greater the loss, and correspondingly the greater the drop in the bond price. In \n Table\u00a014.2 , the row for 1-year maturity bonds shows little price sensitivity\u2014that is, with \nonly 1 year\u2019s earnings at stake, changes in interest rates are not too threatening. But for \n30-year maturity bonds, interest rate swings have a large impact on bond prices. The \nforce of discounting is greatest for the longest-term bonds. \n This is why short-term Treasury securities such as T-bills are considered to be the  safest. \nThey are free not only of default risk but also largely of price risk attributable to interest \nrate volatility. \n  Bond Pricing between Coupon Dates \n Equation 14.2 for bond prices assumes that the next coupon payment is in precisely one \npayment period, either a year for an annual payment bond or 6 months for a semiannual \npayment bond. But you probably want to be able to price bonds all 365 days of the year, \nnot just on the one or two dates each year that it makes a coupon payment! \n In principle, the fact that the bond is between coupon dates does not affect the pric-\ning problem. The procedure is always the same: Compute the present value of each \nremaining payment and sum up. But if you are between coupon dates, there will be \nfractional periods remaining until each payment, and this does complicate the arithmetic \ncomputations. \n Fortunately, bond pricing functions are included in most spreadsheet programs such \nas Excel. The spreadsheet allows you to enter today\u2019s date as well as the maturity date \nof the bond, and so can provide prices for bonds at any date. The nearby box shows \nyou how. \n As we pointed out earlier, bond prices are typically quoted net of accrued interest. These \nprices, which appear in the financial press, are called  flat prices.   The actual  invoice price\nthat a buyer pays for the bond includes accrued interest. Thus,   \nInvoice price\u00a0 5\u00a0Flat price\u00a0 1\u00a0Accrued interest  \n When a bond pays its coupon, flat price equals invoice price, because at that moment \naccrued interest reverts to zero. However, this will be the exceptional case, not the rule. \n Excel pricing functions provide the flat price of the bond. To find the invoice price, we \nneed to add accrued interest. Fortunately, Excel also provides functions that count the days \nsince the last coupon payment date and thus can be used to compute accrued interest. The \nnearby box also illustrates how to use these functions. The box provides examples using \nbonds that have just paid a coupon and so have zero accrued interest, as well as a bond that \nis between coupon dates.     \n Table 14.2 \n Bond prices at different \ninterest rates (8% cou-\npon bond, coupons paid \nsemiannually)     Bond Price at Given Market Interest Rate  \n  Time to \nMaturity    2%    4%    6%    8%    10%  \n 1 year  1,059.11  1,038.83  1,019.13  1,000.00  981.41 \n 10 years  1,541.37  1,327.03  1,148.77  1,000.00  875.35 \n 20 years  1,985.04  1,547.11  1,231.15  1,000.00  828.41 \n 30 years  2,348.65  1,695.22  1,276.76  1,000.00  810.71 \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   456bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   456 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n457  E xcel and most other spreadsheet programs provide \nbuilt-in functions to compute bond prices and yields. \nThey typically ask you to input both the date you buy the bond (called the  settlement date ) and the maturity date of \nthe bond. The Excel function for bond price is   \n5  PRICE(settlement date, maturity date, annual coupon \nrate, yield to maturity, redemption value as percent of par value, number of coupon payments per year)  \n For the 2.25% coupon July 2018 maturity bond high-\nlighted in  Figure\u00a0 14.1 , we would enter the values in \n Spreadsheet\u00a014.1 . (Notice that in spreadsheets, we must \nenter interest rates as decimals, not percentages). Alter-\nnatively, we could simply enter the following function in Excel:   \n5  PRICE(DATE(2012,7,31), DATE(2018,7,31), .0225, .0079, 100, 2)   \n    \n The DATE function in Excel, which we use for both \nthe settlement and maturity date, uses the format DATE(year,month,day). The first date is July 31, 2012, when the bond is purchased, and the second is July 31, 2018, when it matures. Most bonds pay coupons either on the 15th or the last business day of the month. \n Notice that the coupon rate and yield to maturity are \nexpressed as decimals, not percentages. In most cases, \nredemption value is 100 (i.e., 100% of par value), and the resulting price similarly is expressed as a percent of par value. Occasionally, however, you may encounter bonds that pay off at a premium or discount to par value. One example would be callable bonds, discussed shortly. \n The value of the bond returned by the pricing func-\ntion is 108.5392 (cell B12), which nearly matches the \nprice reported in  Table\u00a0 14.1 . (The yield to maturity is reported to only three decimal places, which results in a little rounding error.) This bond has just paid a coupon. In other words, the settlement date is precisely at the begin-ning of the coupon period, so no adjustment for accrued interest is necessary. \n To illustrate the procedure for bonds between coupon \npayments, consider the 6.25% coupon May 2030 bond, also \nappearing in  Figure\u00a014.1 . Using the entries in column D of \nthe spreadsheet, we find in cell D12 that the (flat) price of the bond is 161.002, which matches the price given in the figure except for a few cents\u2019 rounding error. \n What about the bond\u2019s invoice price? Rows 13 \nthrough 16 make the necessary adjustments. The function \ndescribed in cell C13 counts the days since the last coupon. This day count is based on the bond\u2019s settlement date, maturity date, coupon period (1\u00a0 5 \u00a0annual;\u00a02\u00a0 5 \u00a0semian-\nnual), and day count convention (choice 1 uses actual \ndays). The function described in cell C14 counts the total days in each coupon payment period. Therefore, the entries for accrued interest in row 15 are the semiannual coupon multiplied by the fraction of a coupon period that has elapsed since the last payment. Finally, the invoice prices in row 16 are the sum of flat price plus accrued interest. \n As a final example, suppose you wish to find the price \nof the bond in Example 14.2. It is a 30-year maturity bond \nwith a coupon rate of 8% (paid semiannually). The market interest rate given in the latter part of the example is 10%. However, you are not given a specific settlement or matu-rity date. You can still use the PRICE function to value the bond. Simply choose an  arbitrary  settlement date \n(January 1, 2000, is convenient) and let the maturity date be 30 years hence. The appropriate inputs appear in column F of the spreadsheet, with the resulting price, 81.0707% of face value, appearing in cell F16.  \neXcel\nPlease visit us at \nwww.mhhe.com/bkmA BC D E F G\n=B12+B15Formula in column B2.25% coupon bond,\nmaturing July 31, 20186.25% coupon bond,\nmaturing May 20308% coupon bond,30-year maturity1\n23456789\n10111213\n14\n15\n16Settlement date\nMaturity dateAnnual coupon rateYield to maturityRedemption value (% of face value)Coupon payments per year\nFlat price (% of par)\nInvoice priceAccrued interestDays in coupon periodDays since last coupon= DATE (2012, 7, 31)\n= DATE (2018, 7, 31)\n=PRICE(B4,B5,B6,B7,B8,B9)\n=COUPDAYBS(B4,B5,2,1)\n=COUPDAYS(B4,B5,2,1)\n=(B13/B14)*B6*100/27/31/2012\n7/31/2018\n0.02250.0079\n100\n22 2\n0108.5392\n108.53921847/31/2012\n5/15/2030\n0.0625\n0.02117\n100\n161.0020\n162.3097184\n1.308771/1/2000\n1/1/2030\n0.08\n0.1\n100\n81.0707\n81.07071820\n0 0\n Spreadsheet 14.1 \n Bond Pricing in Excel  eXcel APPLICATIONS:    Bond Pricing \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   457bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   457 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n458 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n Suppose an 8% coupon, 30-year bond is selling at $1,276.76. What average rate of \nreturn would be earned by an investor purchasing the bond at this price? We find the interest rate at which the present value of the remaining 60 semiannual payments equals the bond price. This is the rate consistent with the observed price of the bond. There-fore, we solve for  r  in the following equation:   \n$1,276.76 5a\n60\nt51$40\n(11r)t1$1,000\n(11r)60  \n or, equivalently,   \n1,276.76\u00a05\u00a040\u00a03\u00a0Annuity factor(r, 60)\u00a01\u00a01,000\u00a03\u00a0PV factor(r, 60)  \n These equations have only one unknown variable, the interest rate,  r.  You can use a \nfinancial calculator or spreadsheet to confirm that the solution is  r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.03, or 3%, per \nhalf-year.  8   This is the bond\u2019s yield to maturity.    \n The financial press reports yields on an annualized basis, and annualizes the bond\u2019s \nsemiannual yield using simple interest techniques, resulting in an annual percentage \nrate, or APR. Yields annualized using simple interest are also called \u201cbond equivalent yields.\u201d Therefore, the semiannual yield would be doubled and reported in the newspa-per as a bond equivalent yield of 6%. The  effective  annual yield of the bond, however, \naccounts for compound interest. If one earns 3% interest every 6 months, then after 1 year, each dollar invested grows with interest to $1\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1.03) \n2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1.0609, and the \neffective annual interest rate on the bond is 6.09%.  Example 14.4 Yield to Maturity \n   8 On your financial calculator, you would enter the following inputs:  n \u00a0 5 \u00a060 periods; PV\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 1276.76; FV\u00a0 5 \u00a01000; \nPMT\u00a0 5 \u00a040; then you would compute the interest rate (COMP  i  or CPT  i ). Notice that we enter the present value, \nor PV , of the bond as  minus  $1,276.76. Again, this is because most calculators treat the initial purchase price \nof the bond as a cash outflow.  Spreadsheet\u00a014.2  shows how to find yield to maturity using Excel. Without a \nfinancial calculator or spreadsheet, you still could solve the equation, but you would need to use a trial-and-error approach.     14.3 Bond Yields \n  Most bonds do not sell for par value. But ultimately, barring default, they will mature to \npar value. Therefore, we would like a measure of rate of return that accounts for both cur-rent income and the price increase or decrease over the bond\u2019s life. The yield to maturity is the standard measure of the total rate of return. However, it is far from perfect, and we will explore several variations of this measure.  \n   Yield to Maturity \n In practice, an investor considering the purchase of a bond is not quoted a promised rate of return. Instead, the investor must use the bond price, maturity date, and coupon pay-ments to infer the return offered by the bond over its life. The    yield to maturity (YTM)    is \ndefined as the interest rate that makes the present value of a bond\u2019s payments equal to its price. This interest rate is often interpreted as a measure of the average rate of return that will be earned on a bond if it is bought now and held until maturity. To calculate the yield to maturity, we solve the bond price equation for the interest rate given the bond\u2019s price.  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   458bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   458 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 459\n Excel also provides a function for yield to maturity that is especially useful in-between \ncoupon dates. It is    \n\u00a05\u00a0YIELD(settlement date, maturity date, annual coupon rate, bond price, redemption \nvalue as percent of par value, number of coupon payments per year)  \n The bond price used in the function should be the reported flat price, without accrued inter-\nest. For example, to find the yield to maturity of the bond in Example 14.4, we would use \ncolumn B of  Spreadsheet\u00a014.2 . If the coupons were paid only annually, we would change \nthe entry for payments per year to 1 (see cell D8), and the yield would fall slightly to \n5.99%. \n The bond\u2019s yield to maturity is the internal rate of return on an investment in the bond. \nThe yield to maturity can be interpreted as the compound rate of return over the life of the \nbond under the assumption that all bond coupons can be reinvested at that yield.  9   Yield to \nmaturity is widely accepted as a proxy for average return.  \n Yield to maturity differs from the    current yield    of a bond, which is the bond\u2019s annual \ncoupon payment divided by the bond price. For example, for the 8%, 30-year bond cur-\nrently selling at $1,276.76, the current yield would be $80/$1,276.76\u00a0 5 \u00a0.0627, or 6.27%, \nper year. In contrast, recall that the effective annual yield to maturity is 6.09%. For this \nbond, which is selling at a premium over par value ($1,276 rather than $1,000), the coupon \nrate (8%) exceeds the current yield (6.27%), which exceeds the yield to maturity (6.09%). \nThe coupon rate exceeds current yield because the coupon rate divides the coupon pay-\nments by par value ($1,000) rather than by the bond price ($1,276). In turn, the current \nyield exceeds yield to maturity because the yield to maturity accounts for the built-in capi-\ntal loss on the bond; the bond bought today for $1,276 will eventually fall in value to \n$1,000 at maturity. \n Example 14.4 illustrates a general rule: For    premium bonds    (bonds selling above \npar value), coupon rate is greater than current yield, which in turn is greater than yield \n Spreadsheet 14.2 \n Finding yield to maturity in Excel AB C D E\nThe formula entered here is: =YIELD(B3,B4,B5,B6,B7,B8)Annual coupons Semiannual coupons 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n1211Settlement date\nMaturity date\nAnnual coupon rate\nBond price (\ufb02at)\nRedemption value (% of face value)\nCoupon payments per year\nYield to maturity (decimal)1/1/2000\n1/1/2030\n0.08\n127.676\n100\n2\n0.06001/1/2000\n1/1/2030\n0.08\n127.676\n100\n1\n0.0599\neXcel\nPlease visit us at \nwww.mhhe.com/bkm\n9 If the reinvestment rate does not equal the bond\u2019s yield to maturity, the compound rate of return will differ from \nYTM.

For    discount bonds    (bonds selling below par value), these relationships are \nreversed (see Concept Check 3). \n It is common to hear people talking loosely about the yield on a bond. In these cases, \nthey almost always are referring to the yield to maturity.   \n  Yield to Call \n Yield to maturity is calculated on the assumption that the bond will be held until maturity. \nWhat if the bond is callable, however, and may be retired prior to the maturity date? How \nshould we measure average rate of return for bonds subject to a call provision? \n  Figure\u00a014.4  illustrates the risk of call to the bondholder. The top line is the value of a \n\u201cstraight\u201d (i.e., noncallable) bond with par value $1,000, an 8% coupon rate, and a 30-year \ntime to maturity as a function of the market interest rate. If interest rates fall, the bond \nprice, which equals the present value of the promised payments, can rise substantially.  \n Now consider a bond that has the same coupon rate and maturity date but is callable \nat 110% of par value, or $1,100. When interest rates fall, the present value of the bond\u2019s \nscheduled   payments rises, but the call provision allows the issuer to repurchase the bond at \nthe call price. If the call price is less than the present value of the scheduled payments, the \nissuer may call the bond back from the bondholder. \n The bottom line in  Figure\u00a014.4  is the value of the callable bond. At high interest rates, \nthe risk of call is negligible because the present value of scheduled payments is less than \nthe call price; therefore the values of the \nstraight and callable bonds converge. At \nlower rates, however, the values of the bonds \nbegin to diverge, with the difference reflect-\ning the value of the firm\u2019s option to reclaim \nthe callable bond at the call price. At very \nlow rates, the present value of scheduled pay-\nments exceeds the call price, so the bond is \ncalled. Its value at this point is simply the call \nprice, $1,100. \n This analysis suggests that bond market \nanalysts might be more interested in a bond\u2019s \nyield to call rather than yield to maturity, \nespecially if the bond is likely to be called. \nThe yield to call is calculated just like the \nyield to maturity except that the time until \ncall replaces time until maturity, and the call \nprice replaces the par value. This computa-\ntion is sometimes called \u201cyield to first call,\u201d \nas it assumes the issuer will call the bond as \nsoon as it may do so.  What will be the relationship among coupon rate, current yield, and yield to maturity for bonds selling at \ndiscounts from par?

Example 14.5 Yield to Call \n    a. The yield to maturity on two 10-year maturity bonds currently is 7%. Each bond has a call price of \n$1,100. One bond has a coupon rate of 6%, the other 8%. Assume for simplicity that bonds are called as soon as the present value of their remaining payments exceeds their call price. What will be the capital gain on each bond if the market interest rate suddenly falls to 6%?  \n   b. A 20-year maturity 9% coupon bond paying coupons semiannually is callable in 5 years at a call price of $1,050. The bond currently sells at a yield to maturity of 8%. What is the yield to call?    CONCEPT CHECK 14.4   We have noted that most callable bonds are issued with an initial period of call protec-\ntion. In addition, an implicit form of call protection operates for bonds selling at deep dis-\ncounts from their call prices. Even if interest rates fall a bit, deep-discount bonds still will sell below the call price and thus will not be subject to a call. \n Premium bonds that might be selling near their call prices, however, are especially apt \nto be called if rates fall further. If interest rates fall, a callable premium bond is likely to provide a lower return than could be earned on a discount bond whose potential price appreciation is not limited by the likelihood of a call. Investors in premium bonds therefore may be more interested in the bond\u2019s yield to call than its yield to maturity because it may appear to them that the bond will be retired at the call date.   \n  Realized Compound Return versus Yield to Maturity \n We have noted that yield to maturity will equal the rate of return realized over the life of the bond if all coupons are reinvested at an interest rate equal to the bond\u2019s yield to matu-rity. Consider, for example, a 2-year bond selling at par value paying a 10% coupon once a year. The yield to maturity is 10%. If the $100 coupon payment is reinvested at an interest \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   461bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   461 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 6 2 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\nrate of 10%, the $1,000 investment in the bond \nwill grow after 2 years to $1,210, as illustrated \nin  Figure\u00a014.5 , panel A. The coupon paid in the \nfirst year is reinvested and grows with interest to \na second-year value of $110, which together with \nthe second coupon payment and payment of par \nvalue in the second year results in a total value of \n$1,210.  \n To summarize, the initial value of the invest-\nment is  V  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,000. The final value in 2 years is \n V  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,210.

However, in an economy with future interest rate uncertainty, the rates at \nwhich interim coupons will be reinvested are not yet known. Therefore, although realized compound return can be computed  after  the investment period ends, it cannot be computed \nin advance without a forecast of future reinvestment rates. This reduces much of the attrac-tion of the realized return measure. \n Forecasting the realized compound yield over various holding periods or investment \nhorizons is called    horizon analysis    .  The forecast of total return depends on your forecasts \nof  both  the price of the bond when you sell it at the end of your horizon  and  the rate at \nwhich you are able to reinvest coupon income. The sales price depends in turn on the yield to maturity at the horizon date. With a longer investment horizon, however, reinvested cou-pons will be a larger component of your final proceeds. \n Suppose you buy a 30-year, 7.5% (annual payment) coupon bond for $980 (when its \nyield to maturity is 7.67%) and plan to hold it for 20 years. Your forecast is that the bond\u2019s yield to maturity will be 8% when it is sold and that the reinvestment rate on the coupons will be 6%. At the end of your investment horizon, the bond will have 10 years remaining until expiration, so the forecast sales price (using a yield to maturity of 8%) will be $966.45. The 20 coupon payments will grow with compound interest to $2,758.92. (This is the future value of a 20-year $75 annuity with an interest rate of 6%.) \n On the basis of these forecasts, your $980 investment will grow in 20 years to $966.45\u00a0\n 1 \u00a0 $2,758.92\u00a0  5 \u00a0 $3,725.37.

On the one hand, when rates rise, bond \nprices fall, which reduces the value of the portfolio. On the other hand, reinvested coupon income will compound more rapidly at those higher rates. This    reinvestment rate risk    \nwill offset the impact of price risk. In Chapter 16, we will explore this trade-off in more detail and will discover that by carefully tailoring their bond portfolios, investors can pre-cisely balance these two effects for any given investment horizon.    \n   14.4 Bond Prices over Time \n  As we noted earlier, a bond will sell at par value when its coupon rate equals the market interest rate. In these circumstances, the investor receives fair compensation for the time value of money in the form of the recurring coupon payments. No further capital gain is necessary to provide fair compensation. \n When the coupon rate is lower than the market interest rate, the coupon payments alone \nwill not provide investors as high a return as they could earn elsewhere in the market. To receive a competitive return on such an investment, investors also need some price appre-ciation on their bonds. The bonds, therefore, must sell below par value to provide a \u201cbuilt-in\u201d capital gain on the investment.  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   463bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   463 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n464 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n    When bond prices are set according to the present \nvalue formula, any discount from par value provides an \nanticipated capital gain that will augment a below-market coupon rate by just enough to provide a fair total rate of return. Conversely, if the coupon rate exceeds the market interest rate, the interest income by itself is greater than that available elsewhere in the market. Investors will bid up the price of these bonds above their par values. As the bonds approach maturity, they will fall in value because \nfewer of these above-market coupon payments remain. The resulting capital losses offset the large coupon payments so that the bondholder again receives only a competitive rate of return. \n Problem 14 at the end of the chapter asks you to work through the case of the high-\ncoupon bond.  Figure\u00a014.6  traces out the price paths of high- and low-coupon bonds (net of accrued interest) as time to maturity approaches, at least for the case in which the market interest rate is constant. The low-coupon bond enjoys capital gains, whereas the high-coupon bond suffers capital losses.  \n11    \n We use these examples to show that each bond offers investors the same total rate of \nreturn. Although the capital gains versus income components differ, the price of each bond is set to provide competitive rates, as we should expect in well-functioning capital markets. Security returns all should be comparable on an after-tax risk-adjusted basis. If they are not, investors will try to sell low-return securities, thereby driving down their prices until the total return at the now-lower price is competitive with other securities.  To illustrate built-in capital gains or losses, suppose a bond was issued several years ago \nwhen the interest rate was 7%. The bond\u2019s annual coupon rate was thus set at 7%. (We will suppose for simplicity that the bond pays its coupon annually.) Now, with 3 years left in the bond\u2019s life, the interest rate is 8% per year. The bond\u2019s market price is the present value of the remaining annual coupons plus payment of par value. That present value is  \n10     \n$70\u00a03\u00a0Annuity factor(8%, 3)\u00a01\u00a0$1,000\u00a03\u00a0PV factor(8%, 3)\u00a05\u00a0$974.23  \n which is less than par value. \n In another year, after the next coupon is paid and remaining maturity falls to two \nyears, the bond would sell at\n$70\u00a03\u00a0Annuity factor(8%, 2)\u00a01\u00a0$1,000\u00a03\u00a0PV factor(8%, 2)\u00a05\u00a0$982.17     \n thereby yielding a capital gain over the year of $7.94. If an investor had purchased the \nbond at $974.23, the total return over the year would equal the coupon payment plus capital gain, or $70\u00a0 1 \u00a0$7.94\u00a0 5 \u00a0$77.94. This represents a rate of return of $77.94/$974.23, \nor 8%, exactly the rate of return currently available elsewhere in the market.  Example 14.8 Fair Holding-Period Return \n At what price will the bond in Example 14.8 sell \nin yet another year, when only 1 year remains until maturity? What is the rate of return to an investor who purchases the bond when its price is $982.17 and sells it 1 year hence?

Ultimately, however, the price must reach par value at \nthe maturity date, so the price of the premium bond will fall over time while that of the discount bond will rise.  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   464bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   464 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 465\nPrices should continue to adjust until \nall  securities are fairly priced in that \nexpected returns are comparable, given \nappropriate risk and tax adjustments. \n We see evidence of this price \nadjustment in  Figure\u00a0 14.1 . Compare \nthe highlighted bond with the one \njust below it. The July 2018 bond \nhas a coupon rate of 2.25%, while \nthe November 2018 bond has a \nmuch higher coupon rate, 9%. But \nthe higher coupon rate on that bond \ndoes not mean that it offers a higher \nreturn; instead, it sells at a much \nhigher price. The yields to maturity on \nthe two bonds are nearly identical, a \nshade below .8%. This makes sense, \nsince investors should care about their \ntotal return, including both coupon \nincome as well as price change. In the \nend, prices of similar-maturity bonds \nadjust until yields are pretty much \nequalized. \n Of course, the yields across bonds in  Figure\u00a014.1  are not all equal. Clearly, longer term \nbonds at this time offered higher promised yields, a common pattern, and one that reflects \nthe relative risks of the bonds. We will explore the relation between yield and time to matu-\nrity in the next chapter. \n  Yield to Maturity versus Holding-Period Return \n In Example 14.8, the holding-period return and the yield to maturity were equal. The bond \nyield started and ended the year at 8%, and the bond\u2019s holding-period return also equaled \n8%. This turns out to be a general result. When the yield to maturity is unchanged over the \nperiod, the rate of return on the bond will equal that yield. As we noted, this should not be \nsurprising: The bond must offer a rate of return competitive with those available on other \nsecurities. \n However, when yields fluctuate, so will a bond\u2019s rate of return. Unanticipated changes \nin market rates will result in unanticipated changes in bond returns and, after the fact, a \nbond\u2019s holding-period return can be better or worse than the yield at which it initially sells. \nAn increase in the bond\u2019s yield acts to reduce its price, which reduces the holding period \nreturn. In this event, the holding period return is likely to be less than the initial yield to \nmaturity.  12   Conversely, a decline in yield will result in a holding-period return greater than \nthe initial yield.  \n0\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30Price (% of Par Value)\nTime (years)140160\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20Coupon = 12%\nCoupon = 4%\n Figure 14.6 Price path of two 30-year maturity bonds, each \nselling at a yield to maturity of 8%. Bond price approaches par \nvalue as maturity date approaches.  \n12 We have to be a bit careful here. When yields increase, coupon income can be reinvested at higher rates, which \noffsets the impact of the initial price decline. If your holding period is sufficiently long, the positive impact of the \nhigher reinvestment rate can more than offset the initial price decline. But common performance evaluation peri-\nods for portfolio managers are no more than 1 year, and over these shorter horizons the price impact will almost \nalways dominate the impact of the reinvestment rate. We discuss the trade-off between price risk and reinvestment \nrate risk more fully in Chapter 16.  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   465bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   465 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n466 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n   Here is another way to think about the difference between yield to maturity and \nholding-period return. Yield to maturity depends only on the bond\u2019s coupon,  current   \nprice, and par value at maturity. All of these values are observable today, so yield to \nmaturity can be easily calculated. Yield to maturity can be interpreted as a measure of the  average  rate of return if the investment in the bond is held until the bond matures. In \ncontrast, holding-period return is the rate of return over a particular investment period and depends on the market price of the bond at the end of that holding period; of course this price is  not  known today. Because bond prices over the holding period will respond \nto unanticipated changes in interest rates, holding-period return can at most be forecast.  \n  Zero-Coupon Bonds and Treasury Strips \n  Original-issue discount bonds  are less common than coupon bonds issued at par. These are bonds that are issued intentionally with low coupon rates that cause the bond to sell at a dis-count from par value. The most common example of this type of bond is the  zero-coupon \nbond,  which carries no coupons and provides all its return in the form of price appreciation. Zeros provide only one cash flow to their owners, on the maturity date of the bond. \n U.S. Treasury bills are examples of short-term zero-coupon instruments. If the bill has \nface value of $10,000, the Treasury issues or sells it for some amount less than $10,000, agreeing to repay $10,000 at maturity. All of the investor\u2019s return comes in the form of price appreciation. \n Longer-term zero-coupon bonds are commonly created from coupon-bearing notes and \nbonds. A bond dealer who purchases a Treasury coupon bond may ask the Treasury to break down the cash flows to be paid by the bond into a series of independent securities, where each security is a claim to one of the payments of the original bond. For example, a 10-year coupon bond would be \u201cstripped\u201d of its 20 semiannual coupons, and each coupon payment would be treated as a stand-alone zero-coupon bond. The maturities of these bonds would thus range from 6 months to 10 years. The final payment of principal would be treated as another stand-alone zero-coupon security. Each of the payments is now treated as an inde-pendent security and is assigned its own CUSIP number (by the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures), the security identifier that allows for electronic trad-ing over the Fedwire system, a network that connects all Federal Reserve banks and their  Show that if yield to maturity increases, then holding-period return is  less  than initial yield. For example, \nsuppose in Example 14.9 that by the end of the first year, the bond\u2019s yield to maturity is 8.5%. Find the \n1-year holding-period return and compare it to the bond\u2019s initial 8% yield to maturity.  CONCEPT CHECK 14.6  Consider a 30-year bond paying an annual coupon of $80 and selling at par value of \n$1,000. The bond\u2019s initial yield to maturity is 8%. If the yield remains at 8% over the year, the bond price will remain at par, so the holding-period return also will be 8%. But if the yield falls below 8%, the bond price will increase. Suppose the yield falls and the price increases to $1,050. Then the holding-period return is greater than 8%:   \nHolding- period return 5\n$801($1,0502$1,000 )\n$1,0005.13, or 13%   Example 14.9 Yield to Maturity versus Holding-Period Return \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   466bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   466 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 467\nbranches. The payments are still considered obli-\ngations of the U.S. Treasury. The Treasury pro-\ngram under which coupon stripping is performed \nis called STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered \nInterest and Principal of Securities), and these \nzero-coupon securities are called Treasury  strips.   \n What should happen to prices of zeros as time \npasses? On their maturity dates, zeros must sell \nfor par value. Before maturity, however, they \nshould sell at discounts from par, because of the \ntime value of money. As time passes, price should \napproach par value. In fact, if the interest rate is \nconstant, a zero\u2019s price will increase at exactly \nthe rate of interest. \n To illustrate, consider a zero with 30 years \nuntil maturity, and suppose the market interest \nrate is 10% per year. The price of the bond today \nis $1,000/(1.10) 30 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$57.31. Next year, with only \n29 years until maturity, if the yield is still 10%, \nthe price will be $1,000/(1.10) 29 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$63.04, a 10% \nincrease over its previous-year value. Because the \npar value of the bond is now discounted for one less year, its price has increased by the \n1-year discount factor. \n  Figure\u00a014.7  presents the price path of a 30-year zero-coupon bond for an annual market \ninterest rate of 10%. The bond prices rise exponentially, not linearly, until its maturity.   \n  After-Tax Returns \n The tax authorities recognize that the \u201cbuilt-in\u201d price appreciation on original-issue dis-\ncount (OID) bonds such as zero-coupon bonds represents an implicit interest payment to \nthe holder of the security. The IRS, therefore, calculates a price appreciation schedule to \nimpute taxable interest income for the built-in appreciation during a tax year, even if the \nasset is not sold or does not mature until a future year. Any additional gains or losses that \narise from changes in market interest rates are treated as capital gains or losses if the OID \nbond is sold during the tax year. \nMaturity\nDateTodayTime (years)Price ($)1,000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n30\n6\n9\n12\n15\n18\n21\n24\n27\n30\n Figure 14.7 The price of a 30-year zero-coupon bond \nover time at a yield to maturity of 10%. Price equals \n1,000/(1.10)  T  , where  T  is time until maturity.  \n If the interest rate originally is 10%, the 30-year zero would be issued at a price of \n$1,000/(1.10) 305 \u00a0$57.31. The following year, the IRS calculates what the bond price \nwould be if the yield were still 10%. This is $1,000/(1.10) 295 \u00a0$63.04. Therefore, the \nIRS imputes interest income of $63.04\u00a0 2 \u00a0$57.31\u00a0 5 \u00a0$5.73. This amount is subject to tax. \nNotice that the  imputed   interest income is based on a \u201cconstant yield method\u201d that \nignores any changes in market interest rates. \n If interest rates actually fall, let\u2019s say to 9.9%, the bond price will be $1,000/(1.099) 295\n$64.72. If the bond is sold, then the difference between $64.72 and $63.04 is treated \nas capital gains income and taxed at the capital gains tax rate. If the bond is not sold, \nthen the price difference is an unrealized capital gain and does not result in taxes in that \nyear. In either case, the investor must pay taxes on the $5.73 of imputed interest at the \nrate on ordinary income.  Example 14.10 Taxation of Original-Issue Discount Bonds \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   467bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   467 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n468 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n  The procedure illustrated in Example 14.10 applies as well to the taxation of other \noriginal-issue discount bonds, even if they are not zero-coupon bonds. Consider, as an \nexample, a 30-year maturity bond that is issued with a coupon rate of 4% and a yield to maturity of 8%. For simplicity, we will assume that the bond pays coupons once annually. Because of the low coupon rate, the bond will be issued at a price far below par value, specifically at $549.69. If the bond\u2019s yield to maturity is still 8%, then its price in 1 year will rise to $553.66. (Confirm this for yourself.) This would provide a pretax holding-period return (HPR) of exactly 8%:   \nHPR5$401($553.66 2$549.69 )\n$549.695.08  \n The increase in the bond price based on a constant yield, however, is treated as interest income, so the investor is required to pay taxes on the explicit coupon income, $40, as well as the imputed interest income of $553.66\u00a0 2 \u00a0$549.69\u00a0 5 \u00a0$3.97. If the bond\u2019s yield actually \nchanges during the year, the difference between the bond\u2019s price and the constant-yield value of $553.66 would be treated as capital gains income if the bond is sold. \n Suppose that the yield to maturity of the 4% coupon, 30-year maturity bond falls to 7% by the end of the \nfirst year and that the investor sells the bond after the first year. If the investor\u2019s federal plus state tax rate on interest income is 38% and the combined tax rate on capital gains is 20%, what is the investor\u2019s after-tax rate of return?  CONCEPT CHECK 14.7 \n       14.5 Default Risk and Bond Pricing \n  Although bonds generally  promise  a fixed flow of income, that income stream is not risk-\nless unless the investor can be sure the issuer will not default on the obligation. While U.S. \ngovernment bonds may be treated as free of default risk, this is not true of corporate bonds. Therefore, the actual payments on these bonds are uncertain, for they depend to some degree on the ultimate financial status of the firm. \n Bond default risk, usually called    credit risk    ,  is measured by Moody\u2019s Investor Services, \nStandard & Poor\u2019s Corporation, and Fitch Investors Service, all of which provide finan-cial information on firms as well as quality ratings of large corporate and municipal bond issues. International sovereign bonds, which also entail default risk, especially in emerg-ing markets, also are commonly rated for default risk. Each rating firm assigns letter grades to the bonds of corporations and municipalities to reflect their assessment of the safety of the bond issue. The top rating is AAA or Aaa, a designation awarded to only about a dozen firms. Moody\u2019s modifies each rating class with a 1, 2, or 3 suffix (e.g., Aaa1, Aaa2, Aaa3) to provide a finer gradation of ratings. The other agencies use a  1  or  2  \nmodification. \n Those rated BBB or above (S&P, Fitch) or Baa and above (Moody\u2019s) are considered \n   investment-grade bonds    ,  whereas lower-rated bonds are classified as    speculative-\ngrade  or  junk bonds    .  Defaults on low-grade issues are not uncommon. For example, \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   468bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   468 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 469\nalmost half of the bonds rated CCC by Standard & Poor\u2019s at issue have defaulted within \n10 years. Highly rated bonds rarely default, but even these bonds are not free of credit risk. \nFor example, in 2001 WorldCom sold $11.8 billion of bonds with an investment-grade \nrating. Only a year later, the firm filed for bankruptcy and its bondholders lost more than \n80% of their investment. Certain regulated institutional investors such as insurance compa-\nnies have not always been allowed to invest in speculative-grade bonds. \n  Figure\u00a014.8  provides the definitions of each bond rating classification.   \nBond Ratings\nVery High\nQuality High Quality Speculative Very Poor\nStandard & Poor\u2019s AAA AA A BBB BB B CCC D\nMoody\u2019s Aaa Aa A Baa Ba B Caa C\nAt times both Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s have used adjustments to these ratings:\nS&P uses plus and minus signs: A + is the strongest A rating and A \u2212 the weakest.\nMoody\u2019s uses a 1, 2, or 3 designation, with 1 indicating the strongest.\nMoody\u2019s S&P\nAaa AAA Debt rated Aaa and AAA has the highest rating.

Together with the highest rating, this group comprises the high-\ngrade bond class.\nA A Debt rated A has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal,\nalthough it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic conditions than debt in\nhigher-rated categories.\nBaa BBB Debt rated Baa and BBB is regarded as having an adequate capacity to\npay interest and repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate\nprotection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing\ncircumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay\ninterest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higher-rated\ncategories. These bonds are medium-grade obligations.\nBa BB Debt rated in these categories is regarded, on balance, as predominantly\nB B speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in\nCaa CCC accordance with the terms of the obligation. BB and Ba indicate the lowest\nCa CC degree of speculation, and CC and Ca the highest degree of speculation.\nAlthough such debt will likely have some quality and protective\ncharacteristics, these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk\nexposures to adverse conditions. Some issues may be in default.\nC C This rating is reserved for income bonds on which no interest is being paid.\nD D Debt rated D is in default, and payment of interest and/or repayment of\nprincipal is in arrears.\n Figure 14.8 Definitions of each bond rating class \n  Source: Stephen A.

Before 1977, almost all junk bonds were \u201cfallen angels,\u201d that \nis, bonds issued by firms that originally had investment-grade ratings but that had since been downgraded. In 1977, however, firms began to issue \u201coriginal-issue junk.\u201d \n Much of the credit for this innovation is given to Drexel Burnham Lambert, and espe-\ncially its trader Michael Milken. Drexel had long enjoyed a niche as a junk bond trader and had established a network of potential investors in junk bonds. Firms not able to muster an investment-grade rating were happy to have Drexel (and other investment bankers) market their bonds directly to the public, as this opened up a new source of financing. Junk issues were a lower-cost financing alternative than borrowing from banks. \n High-yield bonds gained considerable notoriety in the 1980s when they were used as \nfinancing vehicles in leveraged buyouts and hostile takeover attempts. Shortly thereaf-ter, however, the junk bond market suffered. The legal difficulties of Drexel and Michael Milken in connection with Wall Street\u2019s insider trading scandals of the late 1980s tainted the junk bond market. \n At the height of Drexel\u2019s difficulties, the high-yield bond market nearly dried up. Since \nthen, the market has rebounded dramatically. However, it is worth noting that the average credit quality of newly issued high-yield debt issued today is higher than the average qual-ity in the boom years of the 1980s. Of course, junk bonds are more vulnerable to economic distress than investment-grade bonds. During the financial crisis of 2008\u20132009, prices on these bonds fell dramatically, and their yields to maturity rose equally dramatically. The spread between yields on B-rated bonds and Treasuries widened from around 3% in early 2007 to an astonishing 19% by the beginning of 2009.  \n  Determinants of Bond Safety \n Bond rating agencies base their quality ratings largely on an analysis of the level and trend of some of the issuer\u2019s financial ratios. The key ratios used to evaluate safety are\n    1 .   Coverage ratios \u2014Ratios of company earnings to fixed costs. For example, the \n times-interest-earned ratio  is the ratio of earnings before interest payments and \ntaxes to interest obligations. The  fixed-charge coverage ratio  includes lease pay-\nments and sinking fund payments with interest obligations to arrive at the ratio of earnings to all fixed cash obligations (sinking funds are described below). Low or falling coverage ratios signal possible cash flow difficulties.  \n   2.  Leverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio \u2014A too-high leverage ratio indicates excessive \nindebtedness, signaling the possibility the firm will be unable to earn enough to  satisfy the obligations on its bonds.  \n   3.  Liquidity ratios \u2014The two most common liquidity ratios are the  current ratio  \n(current assets/current liabilities) and the  quick ratio  (current assets excluding \n inventories/current liabilities). These ratios measure the firm\u2019s ability to pay bills coming due with its most liquid assets.  \n   4.  Profitability ratios \u2014Measures of rates of return on assets or equity. Profitabil-\nity ratios are indicators of a firm\u2019s overall financial health. The  return on assets  \n(earnings before interest and taxes divided by total assets) or  return on equity  (net \nincome/equity) are the most popular of these measures. Firms with higher returns on assets or equity should be better able to raise money in security markets because they offer prospects for better returns on the firm\u2019s investments.  \n   5.  Cash flow-to-debt ratio \u2014This is the ratio of total cash flow to outstanding debt.    \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   470bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   470 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 471\n Standard & Poor\u2019s periodically computes median values of selected ratios for firms in \nseveral rating classes, which we present in  Table\u00a014.3 . Of course, ratios must be evalu-\nated in the context of industry standards, and analysts differ in the weights they place on \nparticular ratios. Nevertheless,  Table\u00a014.3  demonstrates the tendency of ratios to improve \nalong with the firm\u2019s rating class. And default rates vary dramatically with bond rating. \nHistorically, only about 1% of industrial bonds originally rated AA or better at issuance \nhad defaulted after 15 years. That ratio is around 7.5% for BBB-rated bonds, and 40% for \nB-rated bonds. Credit risk clearly varies dramatically across rating classes.  \n Many studies have tested whether financial ratios can in fact be used to predict default \nrisk. One of the best-known series of tests was conducted by Edward Altman, who used \ndiscriminant analysis to predict bankruptcy. With this technique a firm is assigned a score \nbased on its financial characteristics. If its score exceeds a cut-off value, the firm is deemed \ncreditworthy. A score below the cut-off value indicates significant bankruptcy risk in the \nnear future. \n To illustrate the technique, suppose that we were to collect data on the return on \nequity (ROE) and coverage ratios of a sample of firms, and then keep records of any \ncorporate bankruptcies. In  Figure\u00a014.9  we plot the \nROE and coverage ratios for each firm, using  X\nfor firms that eventually went bankrupt and  O  for \nthose that remained solvent. Clearly, the  X  and  O\nfirms show different patterns of data, with the sol-\nvent firms typically showing higher values for the \ntwo ratios.  \n The discriminant analysis determines the equa-\ntion of the line that best separates the  X  and  O\nobservations. Suppose that the equation of the line \nis .75\u00a0 5 \u00a0.9\u00a0 3 \u00a0ROE\u00a0 1 \u00a0.4\u00a0 3 \u00a0Coverage. Then, based \non its own financial ratios, each firm is assigned \na \u201c Z -score\u201d equal to .9\u00a0 3 \u00a0ROE\u00a0 1 \u00a0.4\u00a0 3 \u00a0Coverage. \nIf its  Z -score exceeds .75, the firm plots above the \nline and is considered a safe bet;  Z -scores below \n.75 foretell financial difficulty. \n Table 14.3 \n Financial ratios by rating class, long-term debt \n  Note: EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization  \n Source:  Corporate Rating Criteria,   Standard & Poor\u2019s, 2006.     3-year medians  \n    AAA    AA    A    BBB    BB    B    CCC  \n EBIT interest coverage multiple  23.8  19.5  8.0  4.7  2.5  1.2  0.4 \n EBITDA interest coverage multiple  25.5  24.6  10.2  6.5  3.5  1.9  0.9 \n Funds from operations/total debt (%)  203.3  79.9  48.0  35.9  22.4  11.5  5.0 \n Free operating cash flow/total debt (%)  127.6  44.5  25.0  17.3  8.3  2.8  (2.1) \n Total debt/EBITDA multiple  0.4  0.9  1.6  2.2  3.5  5.3  7.9 \n Return on capital (%)  27.6  27.0  17.5  13.4  11.3  8.7  3.2 \n Total debt/total debt  1  equity (%)  12.4  28.3  37.5  42.5  53.7  75.9  113.5 \nROE\nCoverage Ratio\n Figure 14.9 Discriminant analysis  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   471bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   471 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n472 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n Altman found the following equation to best separate failing and nonfailing firms:   \nZ53.1  EBIT\nTotal assets11.0  Sales\nAssets1.42  Shareholders\u2019 equity\nTotal liabilities\n 1.85  Retained earnings\nTotal assets1.72  Working capital\nTotal assets  \n where EBIT\u00a0 5 \u00a0earnings before interest and taxes.  13    Z -scores below 1.23 indicate vulner-\nability to bankruptcy, scores between 1.23 and 2.90 are a gray area, and scores above 2.90 \nare considered safe.   \n   13 Altman\u2019s original work was published in Edward I.

Suppose we add a new variable equal to current liabilities/current assets to Altman\u2019s \nequation. Would you expect this variable to receive a positive or negative coefficient?  CONCEPT CHECK 14.8 \n  Bond Indentures \n A bond is issued with an  indenture,  which is the contract between the issuer and the bond-\nholder. Part of the indenture is a set of restrictions that protect the rights of the bondholders. \nSuch restrictions include provisions relating to collateral, sinking funds, dividend policy, and further borrowing. The issuing firm agrees to these  protective covenants  in order to \nmarket its bonds to investors concerned about the safety of the bond issue. \n  Sinking Funds   Bonds call for the payment of par value at the end of the bond\u2019s life. \nThis payment constitutes a large cash commitment for the issuer. To help ensure the com-\nmitment does not create a cash flow crisis, the firm agrees to establish a    sinking fund    to \nspread the payment burden over several years. The fund may operate in one of two ways:\n    1.  The firm may repurchase a fraction of the outstanding bonds in the open market \neach year.  \n   2.  The firm may purchase a fraction of the outstanding bonds at a special call price \nassociated with the sinking fund provision. The firm has an option to purchase the bonds at either the market price or the sinking fund price, whichever is lower. To allocate the burden of the sinking fund call fairly among bondholders, the bonds chosen for the call are selected at random based on serial number.  \n14        \n The sinking fund call differs from a conventional bond call in two important ways. \nFirst, the firm can repurchase only a limited fraction of the bond issue at the sinking fund call price. At best, some indentures allow firms to use a  doubling option,  which allows \nrepurchase of double the required number of bonds at the sinking fund call price. Second, while callable bonds generally have call prices above par value, the sinking fund call price usually is set at the bond\u2019s par value. \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   472bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   472 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 473\n Although sinking funds ostensibly protect bondholders by making principal repayment \nmore likely, they can hurt the investor. The firm will choose to buy back discount bonds \n(selling below par) at market price, while exercising its option to buy back premium bonds \n(selling above par) at par. Therefore, if interest rates fall and bond prices rise, firms will \nbenefit from the sinking fund provision that enables them to repurchase their bonds at \nbelow-market prices. In these circumstances, the firm\u2019s gain is the bondholder\u2019s loss. \n One bond issue that does not require a sinking fund is a  serial bond   issue, in which the \nfirm sells bonds with staggered maturity dates. As bonds mature sequentially, the principal \nrepayment burden for the firm is spread over time, just as it is with a sinking fund. One \nadvantage of serial bonds over sinking fund issues is that there is no uncertainty introduced \nby the possibility that a particular bond will be called for the sinking fund. The disadvan-\ntage of serial bonds, however, is that bonds of different maturity dates are not interchange-\nable, which reduces the liquidity of the issue.  \n  Subordination of Further Debt   One of the factors determining bond safety is \ntotal outstanding debt of the issuer. If you bought a bond today, you would be understand-\nably distressed to see the firm tripling its outstanding debt tomorrow. Your bond would be \nriskier than it appeared when you bought it. To prevent \nfirms from harming bondholders in this manner,    subordi-\nnation clauses    restrict the amount of additional borrow-\ning. Additional debt might be required to be subordinated \nin priority to existing debt; that is, in the event of bank-\nruptcy,  subordinated   or  junior   debtholders will not be \npaid unless and until the prior senior debt is fully paid off.  \n  Dividend Restrictions   Covenants also limit the \ndividends firms may pay. These limitations protect the \nbondholders because they force the firm to retain assets \nrather than paying them out to stockholders. A typical \nrestriction disallows payments of dividends if cumulative \ndividends paid since the firm\u2019s inception exceed cumula-\ntive retained earnings plus proceeds from sales of stock.  \n  Collateral   Some bonds are issued with specific col-\nlateral behind them.    Collateral    is a particular asset that the \nbondholders receive if the firm defaults on the bond. If the \ncollateral is property, the bond is called a  mortgage bond.   If \nthe collateral takes the form of other securities held by the \nfirm, the bond is a  collateral trust bond.   In the case of equip-\nment, the bond is known as an  equipment obligation bond.   \nThis last form of collateral is used most commonly by firms \nsuch as railroads, where the equipment is fairly standard and \ncan be easily sold to another firm should the firm default. \n Collateralized bonds generally are considered safer \nthan general    debenture    bonds, which are  unsecured,   \nmeaning they do not provide for specific collateral. Credit \nrisk of unsecured bonds depends on the general earning \npower of the firm. If the firm defaults, debenture owners \nbecome general creditors of the firm. Because they are \nsafer, collateralized bonds generally offer lower yields \nthan general debentures. \n  Figure\u00a0 14.10  shows the terms of a bond issued by \nMobil as described in  Moody\u2019s Industrial Manual.

It was issued in 1991 but was not callable until \n2002. Although the call price started at 105.007% of par value, it declines gradually until reaching par after 2020. Most of the terms of the bond are typical and illustrate many of the indenture provisions we have mentioned. However, in recent years there has been a marked trend away from the use of call provisions.    \n  Yield to Maturity and Default Risk \n Because corporate bonds are subject to default risk, we must distinguish between the bond\u2019s promised yield to maturity and its expected yield. The promised or stated yield will be realized only if the firm meets the obligations of the bond issue. Therefore, the stated yield is the  maximum possible  yield to maturity of the bond. The expected yield to maturity \nmust take into account the possibility of a default. \n For example, at the height of the financial crisis in October 2008, as Ford Motor \nCompany struggled, its bonds due in 2028 were rated CCC and were selling at about 33% of par value, resulting in a yield to maturity of about 20%. Investors did not really believe the expected rate of return on these bonds was 20%. They recognized that there was a decent chance that bondholders would not receive all the payments promised in the bond contract and that the yield based on  expected  cash flows was far less than the yield based \non  promised  cash flows. As it turned out, of course, Ford weathered the storm, and inves-\ntors who purchased its bonds made a very nice profit: The bonds were selling in mid-2012 for about 110% of par value, more than triple their value in 2008.  \n Suppose a firm issued a 9% coupon bond 20 years ago. The bond now has 10 years \nleft until its maturity date, but the firm is having financial difficulties. Investors believe that the firm will be able to make good on the remaining interest payments, but at the maturity date, the firm will be forced into bankruptcy, and bondholders will receive only 70% of par value. The bond is selling at $750. \n Yield to maturity (YTM) would then be calculated using the following inputs: \n    Expected YTM    Stated YTM  \n Coupon payment  $45  $45 \n Number of semiannual periods  20 periods  20 periods \n Final payment  $700  $1,000 \n Price  $750  $750 \n The yield to maturity based on promised payments is 13.7%. Based on the expected \npayment of $700 at maturity, however, the yield to maturity would be only 11.6%. The stated yield to maturity is greater than the yield investors actually expect to receive.  Example 14.11 Expected vs. Promised Yield to Maturity \n Example 14.11 suggests that when a bond becomes more subject to default risk, \nits price will fall, and therefore its promised yield to maturity will rise. Similarly, the \ndefault premium, the spread between the stated yield to maturity and that on otherwise-comparable Treasury bonds, will rise. However, its expected yield to maturity, which ultimately is tied to the systematic risk of the bond, will be far less affected. Let\u2019s continue Example 14.11. \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   474bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   474 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 475\n Suppose that the condition of the firm in Example 14.11 deteriorates further, and inves-\ntors now believe that the bond will pay off only 55% of face value at maturity. Investors \nnow demand an expected yield to maturity of 12% (i.e., 6% semiannually), which is \n.4% higher than in Example 14.11. But the price of the bond will fall from $750 to $688 \n[ n \u00a0 5 \u00a020;\u00a0 i \u00a0 5 \u00a06;\u00a0FV\u00a0 5 \u00a0550;\u00a0PMT\u00a0 5 \u00a0$45]. At this price, the stated yield to maturity based \non promised cash flows is 15.2%. While the expected yield to maturity has increased by \n.4%, the drop in price has caused the promised yield to maturity to rise by 1.5%.  Example 14.12 Default Risk and the Default Premium \n What is the expected yield to maturity in Example \n14.12 if the firm is in even worse condition? \nInvestors expect a final payment of only $500, \nand the bond price has fallen to $650.  CONCEPT CHECK 14.9    To compensate for the possibility of default,  corporate \nbonds must offer a    default premium.      The default pre-\nmium is the difference between the promised yield on a \ncorporate bond and the yield of an otherwise-identical \ngovernment bond that is riskless in terms of default. If the \nfirm remains solvent and actually pays the investor all of \nthe promised cash flows, the investor will realize a higher \nyield to maturity than would be realized from the govern-\nment bond. If, however, the firm goes bankrupt, the corporate bond is likely to provide a \nlower return than the government bond. The corporate bond has the potential for both bet-\nter and worse performance than the default-free Treasury bond. In other words, it is riskier. \n The pattern of default premiums offered on risky bonds is sometimes called the  risk \nstructure of interest rates.   The greater the default risk, the higher the default premium. \n Figure\u00a014.11  shows spreads between yields to maturity of bonds of different risk classes. \nYou can see here clear evidence of credit-risk premiums on promised yields. Note, for \nexample, the incredible run-up of \ncredit spreads during the financial \ncrisis of 2008\u20132009.   \n  Credit Default Swaps \n A    credit default swap (CDS)    \nis in effect an insurance policy \non the default risk of a bond or \nloan. To illustrate, the annual pre-\nmium in July 2012 on a 5-year \nGerman government CDS was \nabout 0.75%, meaning that the \nCDS buyer would pay the seller \nan annual premium of $.75 for \neach $100 of bond principal. The \nseller collects these annual pay-\nments for the term of the contract \nbut must compensate the buyer for \nloss of bond value in the event of a \ndefault.  15    \n\u201340\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n201248121620Yield Spread (%)High Yield\nBaa-Rated\nAaa-Rated\n Figure 14.11 Yield spreads between corporate and 10-year Treasury \nbonds \n   Source:   Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \n15 Actually, credit default swaps may pay off even short of an actual default. The contract specifies the particular \n\u201ccredit events\u201d that will trigger a payment. For example, restructuring (rewriting the terms of a firm\u2019s outstanding \ndebt as an alternative to formal bankruptcy proceedings) may be defined as a triggering credit event. \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   475bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   475 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 7 6 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n As originally envisioned, credit default swaps were designed to allow lenders to buy pro-\ntection against default risk. The natural buyers of CDSs would then be large  bondholders \nor banks that wished to enhance the creditworthiness of their outstanding loans. Even if the \nborrower had a shaky credit standing, the \u201cinsured\u201d debt would be as safe as the issuer of the \nCDS. An investor holding a bond with a BB rating could, in principle, raise the effective \nquality of the debt to AAA by buying a CDS on the issuer. \n This insight suggests how CDS contracts should be priced. If a BB-rated corporate \nbond bundled with insurance via a CDS is effectively equivalent to a AAA-rated bond, \nthen the premium on the swap ought to approximate the yield spread between AAA-rated \nand BB-rated bonds.  16   The risk structure of interest rates and CDS prices ought to be \ntightly aligned.  \n  Figure\u00a014.12 , panel A, shows the premiums on 5-year CDSs on German government \ndebt between 2008 and 2012. Even as the strongest economy in the eurozone, German \nCDS prices nevertheless reflect financial strain, first in the deep recession of 2009 and \nthen again in 2011 as the prospects of defaults (and German-led bailouts) of Greece and \nB: Premiums on Spanish Sovereign Debt CDS Contracts\n250500750900\n0\nJan 08\nMay 08Premium (bp/year)\nSep 08\nJan 09\nMay 09\nSep 09\nJan 10\nMay 10\nSep 10\nJan 11\nMay 11\nSep 11\nJan 12\nMay 12\n50100150200\n0\nJan 08\nMay 08Premium (bp/year)\nSep 08\nJan 09A: Premiums on German Sovereign Debt CDS Contracts\nMay 09\nSep 09\nJan 10\nMay 10\nSep 10\nJan 11\nMay 11\nSep 11\nJan 12\nMay 12\n Figure 14.12 Pricing of 5-year credit default swaps \n    Source:   Bloomberg, August 1, 2012,  http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CDBR1U5:IND/chart  . \n   16 We say approximately because there are some differences between highly rated bonds and bonds synthetically \nenhanced with credit default swaps. For example, the term of the swap may not match the maturity of the bond. \nTax treatment of coupon payments versus swap payments may differ, as may the liquidity of the bonds. Finally, \nsome CDSs may entail one-time up-front payments as well as annual premiums.  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   476bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   476 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\n477other eurozone countries worsened. As its perceived credit risk increased, so did the cost \nof insuring its debt.  \n Panel B of  Figure\u00a0 14.12  shows the premiums on 5-year CDS contracts on Spanish \ngovernment debt. Spain\u2019s economy was far shakier than Germany\u2019s, and its CDS prices reflected this fact. By the summer of 2012, its 5-year CDS premiums were around 600 basis points, about eight times the price to insure German debt. \n While CDSs were conceived as a form of bond insurance, it wasn\u2019t long before inves-\ntors realized that they could be used to speculate on the financial health of particular issu-ers. As  Figure\u00a0 14.12  makes clear, someone in early 2011 wishing to bet against Spain might have purchased CDS contracts on its sovereign debt and would have profited as CDS prices spiked over the next 18 months. The nearby box discusses the role of credit default swaps in the financial crisis of 2008\u20132009.   \n  Credit Risk and Collateralized Debt Obligations \n    Collateralized debt obligations,      o r   CDO s, emerged in the last decade as a major mecha-nism to reallocate credit risk in the fixed-income markets. To create a CDO, a financial institution, commonly a bank, first would establish a legally distinct entity to buy and later resell a portfolio of bonds or other loans. A common vehicle for this purpose was the so-called Structured Investment Vehicle (SIV).  \n17   An SIV raises funds, often by issuing short-\nterm commercial paper, and uses the proceeds to buy corporate bonds or other forms of debt   Credit Default Swaps, Systemic Risk, and the Financial \nCrisis of 2008\u20132009 \n The credit crisis of 2008\u20132009, when lending among banks \nand other financial institutions effectively seized up, was in large measure a crisis of transparency. The biggest problem was a widespread lack of confidence in the financial stand-ing of counterparties to a trade. If one institution could not be confident that another would remain solvent, it would understandably be reluctant to offer it a loan. When doubt about the credit exposure of customers and trading part-ners spiked to levels not seen since the Great Depression, the market for loans dried up. \n Credit default swaps were particularly cited for foster-\ning doubts about counterparty reliability. By August 2008, \n$63 trillion of such swaps were reportedly outstanding. (By comparison, U.S. gross domestic product in 2008 was about $14 trillion.) As the subprime mortgage market col-lapsed and the economy entered a deep recession, the potential obligations on these contracts ballooned to levels previously considered unimaginable and the ability of CDS sellers to honor their commitments appeared in doubt. For example, the huge insurance firm AIG alone had sold more than $400 billion of CDS contracts on sub-prime mortgages and other loans and was days from insolvency. But AIG\u2019s insolvency could have triggered the insolvency of other firms that had relied on its promise of protection against loan defaults. These in turn might have triggered further defaults. In the end, the government felt compelled to rescue AIG to prevent a chain reaction of insolvencies. \n Counterparty risk and lax reporting requirements made \nit effectively impossible to tease out firms\u2019 exposures to \ncredit risk. One problem was that CDS positions do not have to be accounted for on balance sheets. And the possibility of one default setting off a sequence of further defaults means that lenders may be exposed to the default of an institution with which they do not even directly trade. Such knock-on effects create  systemic risk,  in which the entire \nfinancial system can freeze up. With the ripple effects of bad debt extending in ever-widening circles, lending to anyone can seem imprudent. \n In the aftermath of the credit crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act \ncalled for new regulation and reforms. One proposal is for \na central clearinghouse for credit derivatives such as CDS contracts. Such a system would foster transparency of posi-tions, would allow the clearinghouse to replace traders\u2019 off-setting long and short positions with a single net position, and would require daily recognition of gains or losses on positions through a margin or collateral account. If losses were to mount, positions would have to be unwound before growing to unsustainable levels. Allowing traders to accurately assess counterparty risk, and limiting such risk through margin accounts and the extra back-up of the clear-inghouse, would go a long way in limiting systemic risk.   WORDS FROM THE STREET \n   17 The legal separation of the bank from the SIV allows the ownership of the loans to be conducted off the bank\u2019s \nbalance sheet, and thus avoids capital requirements the bank would otherwise encounter.  \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   477bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   477 7/25/13   2:41 AM7/25/13   2:41 AMFinal PDF to printer\n4 7 8 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\nBankStructured\ninvestment\nvehicle, SIVSenior trancheSenior-Subordinated\nTranche StructureTypical Terms\n70\u201390% of notional\nprincipal, coupon similar to\nAa-Aaa rated bonds\n5\u201315% of principal,\ninvestment-grade rating\n5\u201315% of principal, higher-\nquality junk rating\n<2%, unrated, coupon rate\nwith 20% credit spreadMezzanine 1\nMezzanine 2\nEquity/\ufb01rst loss/\nresidual tranche\n Figure 14.13 Collateralized debt obligations  \nsuch as mortgage loans or credit card debt. These loans are first pooled together and then \nsplit into a series of classes known as  tranches.   ( Tranche   is the French word for \u201cslice.\u201d)  \n Each tranche is given a different level of seniority in terms of its claims on the underlying \nloan pool, and each can be sold as a stand-alone security. As the loans in the underlying pool \nmake their interest payments, the proceeds are distributed to pay interest to each tranche in \norder of seniority. This priority structure implies that each tranche has a different exposure \nto credit risk. \n  Figure\u00a014.13  illustrates a typical setup. The senior tranche is on top. Its investors may \naccount for perhaps 80% of the principal of the entire pool. But it has first claim on  all  the \ndebt service. Using our numbers, even if 20% of the debt pool defaults, the senior tranche \ncan be paid in full. Once the highest seniority tranche is paid off, the next-lower class (e.g., \nthe mezzanine 1 tranche in  Figure\u00a014.13 ) receives the proceeds from the pool of loans until \nits claims also are satisfied. Using junior tranches to insulate senior tranches from credit \nrisk in this manner, one can create Aaa-rated bonds even from a junk-bond portfolio.  \n Of course, shielding senior tranches from default risk means that the risk is concen-\ntrated on the lower tranches. The bottom tranche\u2014called alternatively the equity, first-loss, \nor residual tranche\u2014has last call on payments from the pool of loans, or, put differently, is \nat the head of the line in terms of absorbing default or delinquency risk. \n Not surprisingly, investors in tranches with the greatest exposure to credit risk demand \nthe highest coupon rates. Therefore, while the lower mezzanine and equity tranches bear \nthe most risk, they will provide the highest returns if credit experience turns out favorably. \n Mortgage-backed CDOs were an investment disaster in 2007\u20132009. These were CDOs \nformed by pooling subprime mortgage loans made to individuals whose credit standing did \nnot allow them to qualify for conventional mortgages. When home prices stalled in 2007 \nand interest rates on these typically adjustable-rate loans reset to market levels, mortgage \ndelinquencies and home foreclosures soared, and investors in these securities lost billions \nof dollars. Even investors in highly rated tranches experienced large losses. \n Not surprisingly, the rating agencies that had certified these tranches as investment-\ngrade came under considerable fire. Questions were raised concerning conflicts of inter-\nest: Because the rating agencies are paid by bond issuers, the agencies were accused of \nresponding to pressure to ease their standards.     \nbod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   478bod61671_ch14_445-486.indd   478 7/17/13   3:51 PM7/17/13   3:51 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 14 Bond Prices and Yields 479\n Related Web sites \nfor this chapter are available at   www.\nmhhe.com/bkm        1 .   Fixed-income securities are distinguished by their promise to pay a fixed or specified stream of income to their holders. The coupon bond is a typical fixed-income security.  \n    2.  Treasury notes and bonds have original maturities greater than 1 year. They are issued at or near par value, with their prices quoted net of accrued interest.  \n    3 .   Callable bonds should offer higher promised yields to maturity to compensate investors for the fact that they will not realize full capital gains should the interest rate fall and the bonds be called away from them at the stipulated call price. Bonds often are issued with a period of call protection. In addition, discount bonds selling significantly below their call price offer implicit call protection.  \n    4.  Put bonds give the bondholder rather than the issuer the option to terminate or extend the life of the bond.  \n    5.  Convertible bonds may be exchanged, at the bondholder\u2019s discretion, for a specified number of shares of stock. Convertible bondholders \u201cpay\u201d for this option by accepting a lower coupon rate on the security.  \n    6.  Floating-rate bonds pay a coupon rate at a fixed premium over a reference short-term interest rate. Risk is limited because the rate is tied to current market conditions.  \n    7.  The yield to maturity is the single interest rate that equates the present value of a security\u2019s cash flows to its price. Bond prices and yields are inversely related. For premium bonds, the coupon rate is greater than the current yield, which is greater than the yield to maturity. The order of these inequalities is reversed for discount bonds.  \n    8.  The yield to maturity is often interpreted as an estimate of the average rate of return to an inves-tor who purchases a bond and holds it until maturity. This interpretation is subject to error, however. Related measures are yield to call, realized compound yield, and expected (versus promised) yield to maturity.  \n    9.  Prices of zero-coupon bonds rise exponentially over time, providing a rate of appreciation equal to the interest rate. The IRS treats this built-in price appreciation as imputed taxable interest income to the investor.  \n    10.  When bonds are subject to potential default, the stated yield to maturity is the maximum pos-sible yield to maturity that can be realized by the bondholder. In the event of default, however, that promised yield will not be realized. To compensate bond investors for default risk, bonds must offer default premiums, that is, promised yields in excess of those offered by default-free government securities. If the firm remains healthy, its bonds will provide higher returns than government bonds. Otherwise the returns may be lower.  \n    11.  Bond safety is often measured using financial ratio analysis. Bond indentures are another safe-guard to protect the claims of bondholders. Common indentures specify sinking fund require-ments, collateralization of the loan, dividend restrictions, and subordination of future debt.  \n    12.  Credit default swaps provide insurance against the default of a bond or loan. The swap buyer pays an annual premium to the swap seller, but collects a payment equal to lost value if the loan later goes into default.  \n    13.  Collateralized debt obligations are used to reallocate the credit risk of a pool of loans. The pool is sliced into tranches, with each tranche assigned a different level of seniority in terms of its claims on the cash flows from the underlying loans. High seniority tranches are usually quite safe, with credit risk concentrated on the lower level tranches. Each tranche can be sold as a stand-alone security.

Assume you have a 1-year investment horizon and are trying to choose among three bonds. All \nhave the same degree of default risk and mature in 10 years. The first is a zero-coupon bond that \npays $1,000 at maturity. The second has an 8% coupon rate and pays the $80 coupon once per year. The third has a 10% coupon rate and pays the $100 coupon once per year. \n     a .   If all three bonds are now priced to yield 8% to maturity, what are their prices?  \n    b .   If you expect their yields to maturity to be 8% at the beginning of next year, what will their \nprices be then? What is your before-tax holding-period return on each bond? If your tax bracket is 30% on ordinary income and 20% on capital gains income, what will your after-tax rate of return be on each?  \n    c.  Recalculate your answer to ( b ) under the assumption that you expect the yields to maturity \non each bond to be 7% at the beginning of next year.    \n   11.

What is the yield to call if the call price is only $1,050?  \n    c.  What is the yield to call if the call price is $1,100, but the bond can be called in 2 years \ninstead of 5 years?    \n   22. A 10-year bond of a firm in severe financial distress has a coupon rate of 14% and sells for \n$900. The firm is currently renegotiating the debt, and it appears that the lenders will allow the firm to reduce coupon payments on the bond to one-half the originally contracted amount.

Find the ratings on bonds of at least 10 companies. \nTry to choose a sample with a wide range of ratings. Then go to a Web site such as   money.msn.com   or   finance.yahoo.com   and obtain, for each firm, as many of the \nfinancial ratios tabulated in  Table\u00a0 14.3  as you can find. Which ratios seem to best \nexplain credit ratings?  \n   2. At   www.bondsonline.com   review the  Industrial Spreads  for various ratings (click the \nlinks on the left-side menus to follow the links to  Today\u2019s Markets, Corporate Bond \nSpreads ). These are spreads above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturities. What fac-\ntors tend to explain the yield differences? How might these yield spreads differ during \nan economic boom versus a recession?   \n  SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS \n   1. The callable bond will sell at the  lower  price. Investors will not be willing to pay as much if they \nknow that the firm retains a valuable option to reclaim the bond for the call price if interest rates \nfall.  \n   2. At a semiannual interest rate of 3%, the bond is worth $40\u00a0 3 \u00a0Annuity factor\u00a0(3%,\u00a060)\u00a0 1 \u00a0$1,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0\nPV factor(3%,\u00a0 60)\u00a0  5 \u00a0 $1,276.76, which results in a capital gain of $276.76. This exceeds the \ncapital loss of $189.29 (i.e., $1,000\u00a0 2 \u00a0$810.71) when the semiannual interest rate increased to 5%.  \n   3. Yield to maturity exceeds current yield, which exceeds coupon rate. Take as an example the 8% \ncoupon bond with a yield to maturity of 10% per year (5% per half-year). Its price is $810.71, and therefore its current yield is 80/810.71\u00a0 5 \u00a0.0987, or 9.87%, which is higher than the coupon rate \nbut lower than the yield to maturity.  \n   4 .     a.

If the interest rate immediately drops to 6% (3% per \nhalf-year), the bond price will rise to $1,000, for a capital gain of $71.06, or 7.65%. The 8% \ncoupon bond currently sells for $1,071.06. If the interest rate falls to 6%, the present value of the  scheduled  payments increases to $1,148.77. However, the bond will be called at $1,100, \nfor a capital gain of only $28.94, or 2.70%.  \n  b . The current price of the bond can be derived from its yield to maturity. Using your calculator, \nset:  n \u00a0 5 \u00a040 (semiannual periods); payment\u00a0 5 \u00a0$45 per period; future value\u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,000; interest \nrate\u00a0 5 \u00a04% per semiannual period.

By year-end, remaining maturity is 29 years. If the yield to maturity were still 8%, the bond \nwould still sell at par and the holding-period return would be 8%. At a higher yield, price \nand return will be lower. Suppose, for example, that the yield to maturity rises to 8.5%. With annual payments of $80 and a face value of $1,000, the price of the bond will be $946.70 [ n \u00a0 5 \u00a029;\u00a0 i \u00a0 5 \u00a08.5%;\u00a0PMT\u00a0 5 \u00a0$80;\u00a0FV\u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,000]. The bond initially sold at $1,000 when issued at \nthe start of the year. The holding-period return is   \nHPR5801\n(946.7021,000 )\n1,0005.026752.67%   \n   which is less than the initial yield to maturity of 8%.  \n   7.

It should receive a negative coefficient. A high ratio of liabilities to assets is a bad omen for a \nfirm, and that should lower its credit rating.  \n 9. The coupon payment is $45. There are 20 semiannual periods. The final payment is assumed \nto be $500. The present value of expected cash flows is $650.

In the real world this is rarely the case. We have seen, for example, that in 2012 short-term Treasury bonds and notes carried yields to maturity less than 1% while the longest-term bonds offered yields of about 2.5%. At the time that these bond prices were quoted, anyway, the longer-term securities had higher yields. This, in fact, is a typical pattern, but as we shall see below, the relationship between time to maturity and yield to maturity can vary dramatically from one period to another. In this chapter we explore the pattern of interest rates for different-term assets. We attempt to identify the factors that account for that pattern and determine what information may be derived from an analysis of the so-called    term struc-\nture of interest rates    ,  the structure of interest \nrates for discounting cash flows of different \nmaturities. \n We demonstrate how the prices of Treasury \nbonds may be derived from prices and yields \nof stripped zero-coupon Treasury securities. We also examine the extent to which the term structure reveals market-consensus forecasts of future interest rates and how the presence of interest rate risk may affect those infer-ences. Finally, we show how traders can use the term structure to compute forward rates that represent interest rates on \u201cforward,\u201d or deferred, loans, and consider the relationship between forward rates and future interest rates.   The Term Structure \nof Interest Rates  CHAPTER FIFTEEN \n    15.1 The Yield Curve \n  Figure 14.1 demonstrated that bonds of different maturities typically sell at different yields \nto maturity. When these bond prices and yields were compiled, long-term bonds sold at higher yields than short-term bonds. Practitioners commonly summarize the relation-ship between yield and maturity graphically in a    yield curve  ,  which is a plot of yield to \n maturity as a function of time to maturity. The yield curve is one of the key concerns of fixed-income investors. It is central to bond valuation and, as well, allows investors to gauge their expectations for future interest rates against those of the market. Such a com-parison is often the starting point in the formulation of a fixed-income portfolio strategy. \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   487bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   487 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n4 8 8 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n In 2012, the yield curve was rising, with long-term bonds offering yields higher than \nthose of short-term bonds. But the relationship between yield and maturity can vary \nwidely.  Figure\u00a0 15.1  illustrates yield curves of several different shapes. Panel A is the \nalmost-flat curve of early 2006. Panel B is a more typical upward-sloping curve from \n2012. Panel C is a downward-sloping or \u201cinverted\u201d curve, and panel D is hump-shaped, \nfirst rising and then falling.   \n   Bond Pricing \n If yields on different-maturity bonds are not all equal, how should we value coupon bonds \nthat make payments at many different times? For example, suppose that yields on zero-\ncoupon Treasury bonds of different maturities are as given in  Table\u00a015.1 . The table tells us \nthat zero-coupon bonds with 1-year maturity sell at a yield to maturity of  y  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a05%, 2-year \nzeros sell at yields of  y  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a06%, and 3-year zeros sell at yields of  y  3 \u00a0 5 \u00a07%. Which of these \nrates should we use to discount bond cash flows? The answer: all of them. The trick is to \nconsider each bond cash flow\u2014either coupon or principal payment\u2014as at least potentially \nsold off separately as a stand-alone zero-coupon bond.  \n Recall the Treasury STRIPS program we introduced in the last chapter (Section 14.4). \nStripped Treasuries are zero-coupon bonds created by selling each coupon or principal \npayment from a whole Treasury bond as a separate cash flow. For example, a 1-year \n Figure 15.1 Treasury yield curves \n  Source: Various editions of  The Wall Street Journal.

Treasury stripping suggests exactly how to value a coupon bond. If each cash flow can be (and in practice often is) sold off as a separate security, then the value of the whole bond should be the same as the value of its cash flows bought piece by piece in the STRIPS market. \n What if it weren\u2019t? Then there would be easy profits to be made. For example, if \ninvestment bankers ever noticed a bond selling for less than the amount at which the sum of its parts could be sold, they would buy the bond, strip it into stand-alone zero-coupon securities, sell off the stripped cash flows, and profit by the price difference. If the bond were selling for  more  than the sum of the values of its individual cash flows, \nthey would run the process in reverse: buy the individual zero-coupon securities in the STRIPS market,  reconstitute  (i.e., reassemble) the cash flows into a coupon bond, and \nsell the whole bond for more than the cost of the pieces. Both    bond stripping    and    bond \nreconstitution    offer opportunities for  arbitrage \u2014the exploitation of mispricing among \ntwo or more securities to clear a riskless economic profit. Any violation of the Law of One Price, that identical cash flow bundles must sell for identical prices, gives rise to arbitrage opportunities. \n Now, we know how to value each stripped cash flow. We simply look up its appropriate \ndiscount rate in  The Wall Street Journal.  Because each coupon payment matures at a \ndifferent time, we discount by using the yield appropriate to its particular maturity\u2014this is the yield on a Treasury strip maturing at the time of that cash flow. We can illustrate with an example.  \n  1 Remember that the yield to maturity of a coupon bond is the  single  interest rate at which the present value \nof cash flows equals market price. To calculate the bond\u2019s yield to maturity on your calculator or spreadsheet, \nset  n \u00a0 5 \u00a03;\u00a0price\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 1,082.17; future value\u00a0 5 \u00a01,000;\u00a0payment\u00a0 5 \u00a0100. Then compute the interest rate.  Calculate the yield to maturity of the coupon bond in Example 15.1, and you may be \nsurprised. Its yield to maturity is 6.88%; so while its maturity matches that of the 3-year \nzero in  Table\u00a015.1 , its yield is a bit lower.  1   This reflects the fact that the 3-year coupon \nbond may usefully be thought of as a  portfolio  of three implicit zero-coupon bonds, one \ncorresponding to each cash flow. The yield on the coupon bond is then an amalgam of the yields on each of the three components of the \u201cportfolio.\u201d Think about what this means: If their coupon rates differ, bonds of the same maturity generally will not have the same yield to maturity.  \n What then do we mean by \u201cthe\u201d yield curve? In fact, in practice, traders refer to \nseveral yield curves. The    pure yield curve    refers to the curve for stripped, or zero-coupon,  Suppose the yields on stripped Treasuries are as given in  Table\u00a015.1 , and we wish to \nvalue a 10% coupon bond with a maturity of 3 years. For simplicity, assume the bond \nmakes its payments annually. Then the first cash flow, the $100 coupon paid at the end of the first year, is discounted at 5%; the second cash flow, the $100 coupon at the end of the second year, is discounted at 6%; and the final cash flow consisting of the final \ncoupon plus par value, or $1,100, is discounted at 7%. The value of the coupon bond is therefore\n   100\n1.051100\n1.06211,100\n1.073595.238 189.000 1897.928 5$1,082.17   Example 15.1 Valuing Coupon Bonds \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   489bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   489 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n490 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\nTreasuries. In contrast, the    on-the-run yield curve    refers to the plot of yield as a function \nof maturity for recently issued coupon bonds selling at or near par value. As we\u2019ve just seen, \nthere may be significant differences in these two curves. The yield curves published in the financial press, for example, in  Figure\u00a0 15.1 , are typically on-the-run curves. On-the-run Treasuries have the greatest liquidity, so traders have keen interest in their yield curve.     \n   15.2 The Yield Curve and Future Interest Rates \n  We\u2019ve told you what the yield curve is, but we haven\u2019t yet had much to say about where it comes from. For example, why is the curve sometimes upward-sloping and other times downward-sloping? How do expectations for the evolution of interest rates affect the shape of today\u2019s yield curve? \n These questions do not have simple answers, so we will begin with an admittedly ideal-\nized framework, and then extend the discussion to more realistic settings. To start, consider a world with no uncertainty, specifically, one in which all investors already know the path of future interest rates.  \n   The Yield Curve under Certainty \n If interest rates are certain, what should we make of the fact that the yield on the 2-year zero coupon bond in  Table\u00a015.1  is greater than that on the 1-year zero? It can\u2019t be that one bond is expected to provide a higher rate of return than the other. This would not be pos-sible in a certain world\u2014with no risk, all bonds (in fact, all securities!) must offer identical returns, or investors will bid up the price of the high-return bond until its rate of return is no longer superior to that of other bonds. \n Instead, the upward-sloping yield curve is evidence that short-term rates are going to \nbe higher next year than they are now. To see why, consider two 2-year bond strategies. The first strategy entails buying the 2-year zero offering a 2-year yield to maturity of  y  \n2 \u00a0 5 \u00a06%, and holding it until maturity. The zero with face value $1,000 is purchased today \nfor $1,000/1.06 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$890 and matures in 2 years to $1,000. The total 2-year growth factor \nfor the investment is therefore $1,000/$890\u00a0 5 \u00a01.06 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a01.1236. \n Now consider an alternative 2-year strategy. Invest the same $890 in a 1-year zero- \ncoupon bond with a yield to maturity of 5%. When that bond matures, reinvest the pro-\nceeds in another 1-year bond.  Figure\u00a015.2  illustrates these two strategies. The interest rate that 1-year bonds will offer next year is denoted as  r  \n2 .  \n Remember, both strategies must provide equal returns\u2014neither entails any risk. \nTherefore, the proceeds after 2 years to either strategy must be equal:\n    B uy and hold 2- year zero 5Roll over 1- year bonds\n $89031.0625$89031.053(11r2)  \n We find next year\u2019s interest rate by solving 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a01.06 2 /1.05\u00a0 5  \u00a01.0701, or  r  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a07.01%. So \nwhile the 1-year bond offers a lower yield to maturity than the 2-year bond (5% versus 6%),  Calculate the price and yield to maturity of a 3-year bond with a coupon rate of 4% making annual \ncoupon payments. Does its yield match that of either the 3-year zero or the 10% coupon bond considered in Example 15.1? Why is the yield spread between the 4% bond and the zero smaller than the yield spread between the 10% bond and the zero?  CONCEPT CHECK 15.1 \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   490bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   490 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 15 The Term Structure of Interest Rates 491\nwe see that it has a compensating advantage: It allows you to roll over your funds into \nanother short-term bond next year when rates will be higher. Next year\u2019s interest rate is \nhigher than today\u2019s by just enough to make rolling over 1-year bonds equally attractive as \ninvesting in the 2-year bond. \n To distinguish between yields on long-term bonds versus short-term rates that will be \navailable in the future, practitioners use the following terminology. They call the yield to \nmaturity on zero-coupon bonds the    spot rate    ,  meaning the rate that prevails  today   for a \ntime period corresponding to the zero\u2019s maturity. In contrast, the    short rate    for a given time \ninterval (e.g., 1 year) refers to the interest rate for that interval available at different points in \ntime. In our example, the short rate today is 5%, and the short rate next year will be 7.01%. \n Not surprisingly, the 2-year spot rate is an average of today\u2019s short rate and next year\u2019s \nshort rate. But because of compounding, that average is a geometric one.  2   We see this by \nagain equating the total return on the two competing 2-year strategies:  \n     (11y2)25(11r1)3(11r2)   (15.1) \n  11y253(11r1)3(11r2)41/2   \n Equation 15.1 begins to tell us why the yield curve might take on different shapes at \ndifferent times. When next year\u2019s short rate,  r  2 , is greater than this year\u2019s short rate,  r  1 , the \naverage of the two rates is higher than today\u2019s rate, so  y  2 \u00a0.\u00a0 r  1  and the yield curve slopes \nupward. If next year\u2019s short rate were less than  r  1 , the yield curve would slope downward. \n2 In an arithmetic average, we add  n  numbers and divide by  n.  In a geometric average, we multiply  n  numbers and \ntake the  n th root. \n Figure 15.2 Two 2-year investment programs  012 Time Line\nAlternative 1: Buy and\nhold 2-year zero\nAlternative 2: Buy a 1-year\nzero, and reinvest proceeds in\nanother 1-year zero$890\n$890 $934.50(1 + r2)$890 \u00d71.062 = $10002-Year Investment\n1-Year Investment 1-Year Investment\n    $890 \u00d7 1.05\n = $934.50\nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   491bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   491 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n492 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\nThus, at least in part, the yield curve reflects the market\u2019s assessments of coming interest rates. \nThe following example uses a similar analysis to find the short rate that will prevail in year 3. \n Use  Table\u00a015.1  to find the short rate that will prevail in the fourth year. Confirm that the discount factor \non the 4-year zero is a geometric average of 1 1  the short rates in the next 4 years.  CONCEPT CHECK 15.2 \n    Figure\u00a0 15.3  summarizes the results of our analysis and emphasizes the difference \nbetween short rates and spot rates. The top line presents the short rates for each year. The \nlower lines present spot rates\u2014or, equivalently, yields to maturity on zero-coupon bonds for different holding periods\u2014extending from the present to each relevant maturity date.   \n  Holding-Period Returns \n We\u2019ve argued that the multiyear cumulative returns on all of our competing bonds ought to be equal. What about holding-period returns over shorter periods such as a year? You might think that bonds selling at higher yields to maturity will offer higher 1-year returns, but this is not the case. In fact, once you stop to think about it, it\u2019s clear that this  cannot  be \ntrue. In a world of certainty, all bonds must offer identical returns, or investors will flock to the higher-return securities, bidding up their prices, and reducing their returns. We can illustrate by using the bonds in  Table\u00a015.1 . \n The 1-year bond in  Table\u00a015.1  can be bought today for $1,000/1.05\u00a0 5 \u00a0$952.38 and \nwill mature to its par value in 1 year. It pays no coupons, so total investment income is \njust its price appreciation, and its rate of return is ($1,000\u00a0 2 \u00a0$952.38)/$952.38\u00a0 5 \u00a0.05.  Example 15.3 Holding-Period Returns on Zero-Coupon Bonds  Now we compare two 3-year strategies. One is to buy a 3-year zero, with a yield to \nmaturity from  Table\u00a015.1  of 7%, and hold it until maturity. The other is to buy a 2-year \nzero yielding 6%, and roll the proceeds into a 1-year bond in year 3, at the short rate  r  3 . \nThe growth factor for the invested funds under each policy will be:\nBuy and hold 3-year zero\u00a05\u00a0Buy 2-year zero; roll proceeds into 1-year bond\n (1\u00a01\u00a0y 3)3\u00a05\u00a0(1\u00a01\u00a0y 2)2\u00a03\u00a0(1\u00a01\u00a0r 3) \n 1.073\u00a05\u00a01.062\u00a03\u00a0(1\u00a01\u00a0r 3)      \n which implies that  r  3 \u00a0 5 \u00a01.07 3 /1.06 2 \u00a0 2 \u00a01\u00a0 5 \u00a0.09025\u00a0 5 \u00a09.025%.

It equates the total return on two  n -year investment \nstrategies: buying and holding an  n -year zero-coupon bond versus buying an ( n \u00a0 2 \u00a01)-year \nzero and rolling over the proceeds into a 1-year bond.\n    (11yn)n5(11yn21)n213(11rn)  (15.2)   \n where  n  denotes the period in question, and  y   n   is the yield to maturity of a zero-coupon \nbond with an  n -period maturity. Given the observed yield curve, we can solve Equation 15.2 \nfor the short rate in the last period:\n    (11rn)5(11yn)n\n(11yn21)n21  (15.3)   The 2-year bond can be bought for $1,000/1.06 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$890.00. Next year, the bond will \nhave a remaining maturity of 1 year and the 1-year interest rate will be 7.01%. Therefore, \nits price next year will be $1,000/1.0701\u00a0 5 \u00a0$934.49, and its 1-year holding-period rate \nof return will be ($934.49\u00a0 2 \u00a0$890.00)/$890.00\u00a0 5 \u00a0.05, for an identical 5% rate of return. \n Show that the rate of return on the 3-year zero in  Table\u00a015.1  also will be 5%. Hint: Next year, the bond will \nhave a maturity of 2 years. Use the short rates derived in  Figure\u00a015.3  to compute the 2-year spot rate that \nwill prevail a year from now.

The numerator on the right-hand side is the \ntotal growth factor of an investment in an  n -year zero held until maturity. Similarly, \nthe denominator is the growth factor of an investment in an ( n \u00a0 2 \u00a01)-year zero. Because the \nformer investment lasts for one more year than the latter, the difference in these growth \nfactors must be the rate of return available in year  n  when the ( n \u00a0 2 \u00a01)-year zero can be \nrolled over into a 1-year investment. \n Of course, when future interest rates are uncertain, as they are in reality, there is no \nmeaning to inferring \u201cthe\u201d future short rate. No one knows today what the future interest rate will be. At best, we can speculate as to its expected value and associated uncertainty. Nevertheless, it still is common to use Equation 15.3 to investigate the implications of the yield curve for future interest rates. Recognizing that future interest rates are uncertain, we call the interest rate that we infer in this matter the    forward interest rate    rather than \nthe  future short rate,  because it need not be the interest rate that actually will prevail at the \nfuture date. \n If the forward rate for period  n  is denoted  f  \n n  , we then define  f   n   by the equation\n    (11fn)5(11yn)n\n(11yn21)n21  (15.4)   \n Equivalently, we may rewrite Equation 15.4 as\n    (11yn)n5(11yn21)n21(11fn)  (15.5)   \n In this formulation, the forward rate is  defined  as the \u201cbreak-even\u201d interest rate that equates \nthe return on an  n -period zero-coupon bond to that of an ( n \u00a0 2 \u00a01)-period zero-coupon bond \nrolled over into a 1-year bond in year  n.  The actual total returns on the two  n -year strate-\ngies will be equal if the short interest rate in year  n  turns out to equal  f   n  . \n Suppose a bond trader uses the data presented in  Table\u00a015.1 . The forward rate for year\u00a04 \nwould be computed as\n   11f45(1\u00a01\u00a0y 4)4\n(1\u00a01\u00a0y 3)351.084\n1.07351.1106  \n Therefore, the forward rate is  f  4 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.1106, or 11.06%.  Example 15.4 Forward Rates \n  We emphasize again that the interest rate that actually will prevail in the future need \nnot equal the forward rate, which is calculated from today\u2019s data. Indeed, it is not even \nnecessarily the case that the forward rate \nequals the expected value of the future short interest rate. This is an issue that we address in the next section. For now, how-ever, we note that forward rates equal future short rates in the  special case  of interest rate \ncertainty. \n      You\u2019ve been exposed to many \u201crates\u201d in the last few pages. \nExplain the differences between spot rates, short rates, and forward rates.

Spot yields are derived for the yield curve of bonds that are selling at their par value, also referred to as the current coupon or \u201con-the-run\u201d bond yield curve. \n The spot rates for each maturity date are used to calcu-\nlate the present value of each period\u2019s cash flow. The sum \nof these cash flows is the price of the bond. Given its price, the bond\u2019s yield to maturity can then be computed. If you were to err and use the yield to maturity of the on-the-run bond to discount each of the bond\u2019s coupon payments, you could find a significantly different price.

We have argued so far that, in a certain world, different investment strategies with common terminal dates must provide equal rates of return. For example, two consecutive 1-year investments in zeros would need to offer the same total return as an equal-sized investment in a 2-year zero. Therefore, under certainty,\n    (11r\n1)(11r2)5(11y2)2  (15.6)   \n What can we say when  r  2  is not known today? \n For example, suppose that today\u2019s rate is  r  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a05% and that the  expected  short rate for \nthe following year is  E ( r  2 )\u00a0 5 \u00a06%. If investors cared only about the expected value of the \ninterest rate, then the yield to maturity on a 2-year zero would be determined by using \nthe expected short rate in Equation 15.6:\n   (11y2)25(11r1)3311E(r2)451.0531.06  \n The price of a 2-year zero would be $1,000/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y  2 ) 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,000/(1.05\u00a0 3 \u00a01.06)\u00a0 5 \u00a0$898.47. \n But now consider a short-term investor who wishes to invest only for 1 year. She can \npurchase the 1-year zero for $1,000/1.05\u00a0  5 \u00a0 $952.38, and lock in a riskless 5% return \nbecause she knows that at the end of the year, the bond will be worth its maturity value of \n$1,000. She also can purchase the 2-year zero. Its  expected  rate of return also is 5%: Next \nyear, the bond will have 1 year to maturity, and we expect that the 1-year interest rate will be 6%, implying a price of $943.40 and a holding-period return of 5%. \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   495bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   495 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n496 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n But the rate of return on the 2-year bond is risky. If next year\u2019s interest rate turns out to \nbe above expectations, that is, greater than 6%, the bond price will be below $943.40; con-\nversely if  r  2  turns out to be less than 6%, the bond price will exceed $943.40. Why should \nthis short-term investor buy the  risky  2-year bond when its expected return is 5%, no better \nthan that of the  risk-free  1-year bond? Clearly, she would not hold the 2-year bond unless \nit offered a higher expected rate of return. This requires that the 2-year bond sell at a price lower than the $898.47 value we derived when we ignored risk. \n  The result in Example 15.5\u2014that the forward rate exceeds the expected short rate\u2014\nshould not surprise us. We defined the forward rate as the interest rate that would need to prevail in the second year to make the long- and short-term investments equally attractive,  ignoring risk.  When we account for risk, it is clear that short-term investors will shy away \nfrom the long-term bond unless it offers an expected return greater than that of the 1-year bond. Another way of putting this is to say that investors will require a risk premium to hold the longer-term bond. The risk-averse investor would be willing to hold the long-term bond only if the expected value of the short rate is less than the break-even value,  f  \n2 , because the \nlower the expectation of  r  2 , the greater the anticipated return on the long-term bond. \n Therefore, if most individuals are short-term investors, bonds must have prices that \nmake  f  2  greater than  E ( r  2 ). The forward rate will embody a premium compared with the \nexpected future short-interest rate. This    liquidity premium    compensates short-term inves-\ntors for the uncertainty about the price at which they will be able to sell their long-term bonds at the end of the year.  \n3  \n Suppose that the required liquidity premium for the short-term investor is 1%. \nWhat must  E ( r  2 ) be if  f  2  is 7%?  CONCEPT CHECK 15.5 \n    Perhaps surprisingly, we also can imagine scenarios in which long-term bonds can be \nperceived by investors to be  safer  than short-term bonds. To see how, we now consider a \n\u201clong-term\u201d investor, who wishes to invest for a full 2-year period. Suppose that the investor \n  3  Liquidity  refers to the ability to sell an asset easily at a predictable price. Because long-term bonds have greater \nprice risk, they are considered less liquid in this context and thus must offer a premium.  Suppose that most investors have short-term horizons and therefore are willing to hold \nthe 2-year bond only if its price falls to $881.83. At this price, the expected holding-period return on the 2-year bond is 7% (because 943.40/881.83\u00a0 5 \u00a01.07). The risk pre-\nmium of the 2-year bond, therefore, is 2%; it offers an expected rate of return of 7% versus the 5% risk-free return on the 1-year bond. At this risk premium, investors are willing to bear the price risk associated with interest rate uncertainty. \n When bond prices reflect a risk premium, however, the forward rate,  f  \n2 , no longer \nequals the expected short rate,  E ( r  2 ). Although we have assumed that  E ( r  2 )\u00a0 5 \u00a06%, it \nis easy to confirm that  f  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a08%. The yield to maturity on the 2-year zeros selling at \n$881.83 is 6.49%, and\n   11f25(1\u00a01\u00a0y 2)2\n1\u00a01\u00a0y 151.06492\n1.0551.08   Example 15.5 Bond Prices and Forward Rates with Interest Rate Risk \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   496bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   496 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 15 The Term Structure of Interest Rates  497\ncan purchase a $1,000 par value 2-year zero-coupon bond for $890 and lock in a guaranteed \nyield to maturity of  y  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a06%. Alternatively, the investor can roll over two 1-year invest-\nments. In this case an investment of $890 would grow in 2 years to 890\u00a0 3 \u00a01.05\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  2 ), \nwhich is an uncertain amount today because  r  2  is not yet known. The break-even year-2 \ninterest rate is, once again, the forward rate, 7.01%, because the forward rate is defined as the rate that equates the terminal value of the two investment strategies. \n The expected value of the payoff of the rollover strategy is 890\u00a0 3 \u00a01.05\u00a0 3 \u00a0[1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 E ( r  \n2 )]. \nIf  E ( r  2 ) equals the forward rate,  f  2 , then the expected value of the payoff from the rollover \nstrategy will equal the  known  payoff from the 2-year-maturity bond strategy. \n Is this a reasonable presumption? Once again, it is only if the investor does not care \nabout the uncertainty surrounding the final value of the rollover strategy. Whenever that risk is important, however, the long-term investor will not be willing to engage in the rollover strategy unless its expected return exceeds that of the 2-year bond. In this case the investor would require that\n   (1.05)311E(r\n2)4.(1.06)25(1.05)(11f2)  \n which implies that  E ( r  2 ) exceeds  f  2 . The investor would require that the expected value of \nnext year\u2019s short rate exceed the forward rate. \n Therefore, if all investors were long-term investors, no one would be willing to hold \nshort-term bonds unless those bonds offered a reward for bearing interest rate risk. In this \nsituation bond prices would be set at levels such that rolling over short bonds resulted in greater expected return than holding long bonds. This would cause the forward rate to be less than the expected future spot rate. \n For example, suppose that in fact  E ( r  \n2 )\u00a0 5 \u00a08%. The liquidity premium therefore is nega-\ntive:  f  2 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 E ( r  2 )\u00a0 5 \u00a07.01%\u00a0 2  \u00a08%\u00a0 5  \u00a0 2 .99%. This is exactly opposite from the conclusion that \nwe drew in the first case of the short-term investor. Clearly, whether forward rates will equal expected future short rates depends on investors\u2019 readiness to bear interest rate risk, as well as their willingness to hold bonds that do not correspond to their investment horizons.   \n   15.4 Theories of the Term Structure \n   The Expectations Hypothesis \n The simplest theory of the term structure is the    expectations hypothesis    .  A common ver-\nsion of this hypothesis states that the forward rate equals the market consensus expecta-tion of the future short interest rate; that is,  f  \n2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E ( r  2 ), and liquidity premiums are zero. \nIf  f  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E ( r  2 ), we may relate yields on long-term bonds to expectations of future interest \nrates. In addition, we can use the forward rates derived from the yield curve to infer market expectations of future short rates. For example, with (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y  \n2 ) 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  1 )\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 f  2 ) from \nEquation 15.5, if the expectations hypothesis is correct we may also write that (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y  2 ) 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0\n(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  1 )\u00a0 3 \u00a0[1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 E ( r  2 )]. The yield to maturity would thus be determined solely by current \nand expected future one-period interest rates. An upward-sloping yield curve would be clear evidence that investors anticipate increases in interest rates. \n If the expectations hypothesis is valid, what can we conclude about the  premiums \nnecessary to induce investors to hold bonds of different maturities from their \ninvestment horizons?  CONCEPT CHECK 15.6 \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   497bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   497 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n498   By the way, nothing limits us to nominal bonds when using the expectations hypothesis. \nThe nearby box points out that we can apply the theory to the term structure of real \ninterest rates as well, and thereby learn something about market expectations of coming \ninflation rates.  \n  Liquidity Preference \n We noted earlier that short-term investors will be unwilling to hold long-term bonds unless \nthe forward rate exceeds the expected short interest rate,  f  2 \u00a0.\u00a0 E ( r  2 ), whereas long-term \ninvestors will be unwilling to hold short bonds unless \n E ( r  2 )\u00a0.\u00a0 f  2 . In other words, both groups of investors \nrequire a premium to hold bonds with maturities dif-\nferent from their investment horizons. Advocates of the \n    liquidity preference theory    of the term structure believe \nthat short-term investors dominate the market so that the \nforward rate will generally exceed the expected short \nrate. The excess of  f  2  over  E ( r  2 ), the  liquidity premium,   is \npredicted to be positive.  \n To illustrate the differing implications of these theories \nfor the term structure of interest rates, suppose the short interest rate is expected to be \nconstant indefinitely. Suppose that  r  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a05% and that  E ( r  2 )\u00a0 5 \u00a05%,\u00a0 E ( r  3 )\u00a0 5 \u00a05%, and so on. \nUnder the expectations hypothesis the 2-year yield to maturity could be derived from the \nfollowing:\n    (11y2)25(11r1)311E(r2)4\n 5(1.05)(1.05)   \n so that  y  2  equals 5%. Similarly, yields on bonds of all maturities would equal 5%.  The liquidity premium hypothesis also holds \nthat  issuers   of bonds prefer to issue long-term \nbonds to lock in borrowing costs. How would \nthis preference contribute to a positive liquidity \npremium?  CONCEPT CHECK 15.7  The Expectations Hypothesis and Forward Inflation Rates \n Forward rates derived from conventional bonds are nomi-\nnal interest rates. But using price-level-indexed bonds such \nas TIPS, we can also calculate forward  real  interest rates. \nRecall that the difference between the real rate and the \nnominal rate is approximately the expected inflation rate. \nTherefore, comparing real and nominal forward rates \nmight give us a glimpse of the market\u2019s expectation of \nfuture inflation rates. The real versus nominal spread is a \nsort of forward inflation rate. \n As part of its monetary policy, the Federal Reserve \nBoard periodically reduces its target federal funds rate \nin an attempt to stimulate the economy. The following \npage capture from a Bloomberg screen shows the minute-\nby-minute spread between the 5-year forward nominal \ninterest rate and forward real rate on one day the Fed \nannounced such a policy change. The spread immediately \nwidened at the announcement, signifying that the market \nexpected the more expansionary monetary policy to even-\ntually result in a higher inflation rate. The increase in the \ninflation rate implied by the graph is fairly mild, about .05%, from about 2.53% to 2.58%, but the impact of the \nannouncement is very clear, and the speed of adjustment \nto the announcement was impressive.

If we can use the term structure to infer the expectations of other investors in the economy, we can use those expectations as bench-marks for our own analysis. For example, if we are relatively more optimistic than other investors that interest rates will fall, we will be more willing to extend our portfolios into longer-term bonds. Therefore, in this section, we will take a careful look at what informa-tion can be gleaned from a careful analysis of the term structure. Unfortunately, while the yield curve does reflect expectations of future interest rates, it also reflects other factors such as liquidity premiums. Moreover, forecasts of interest rate changes may have different investment implications depending on whether those changes are driven by changes in the expected inflation rate or the real rate, and this adds another layer of complexity to the proper interpretation of the term structure. \n We have seen that under certainty, 1 plus the yield to maturity on a zero-coupon bond \nis simply the geometric average of 1 plus the future short rates that will prevail over the life of the bond. This is the meaning of Equation 15.1, which we give in general form here:\n   11y\nn53(11r1)(11r2)c(11rn)41/n  \n When future rates are uncertain, we modify Equation 15.1 by replacing future short rates with forward rates:\n    11y\nn53(11r1)(11f2)(11f3)c(11fn)41/n  (15.7)   \n Thus there is a direct relationship between yields on various maturity bonds and forward \ninterest rates. \n First, we ask what factors can account for a rising yield curve. Mathematically, if the \nyield curve is rising,  f   n  1 1  must exceed  y   n  . In words, the yield curve is upward-sloping at \nany maturity date,  n,  for which the forward rate for the coming period is greater than the \nyield at that maturity. This rule follows from the notion of the yield to maturity as an aver-\nage (albeit a geometric average) of forward rates. \n If the yield curve is to rise as one moves to longer maturities, it must be the case that \nextension to a longer maturity results in the inclusion of a \u201cnew\u201d forward rate that is higher than the average of the previously observed rates. This is analogous to the observation that if a new student\u2019s test score is to increase the class average, that student\u2019s score must exceed the class\u2019s average without her score. To increase the yield to maturity, an above-average forward rate must be added to the other rates used in the averaging computation. \n If the yield to maturity on 3-year zero-coupon bonds is 7%, then the yield on 4-year \nbonds will satisfy the following equation:\n  (1\u00a01\u00a0y 4)4\u00a05\u00a0(1.07)3(1\u00a01\u00a0f 4)   \n If  f  4 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.07, then  y  4  also will equal .07. (Confirm this!) If  f  4  is greater than 7%,  y  4  will \nexceed 7%, and the yield curve will slope upward. For example, if  f  4 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 .08, then \n(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y  4 ) 4 \u00a0 5 \u00a0(1.07) 3 (1.08)\u00a0 5 \u00a01.3230, and  y  4 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.0725.  Example 15.6 Forward Rates and the Slopes of the Yield Curve \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   501bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   501 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n502 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n   Given that an upward-sloping yield curve is always associated with a forward rate higher \nthan the spot, or current, yield to maturity, we ask next what can account for that higher for-\nward rate. Unfortunately, there always are two possible answers to this question. Recall that the forward rate can be related to the expected future short rate according to this equation:\n    f\nn5E(rn)1Liquidit y premium  (15.8)   \n where the liquidity premium might be necessary to induce investors to hold bonds of \nmaturities that do not correspond to their preferred investment horizons. \n By the way, the liquidity premium need not be positive, although that is the position \ngenerally taken by advocates of the liquidity premium hypothesis. We showed previously that if most investors have long-term horizons, the liquidity premium in principle could be negative. \n In any case, Equation 15.8 shows that there are two reasons that the forward rate could be \nhigh. Either investors expect rising interest rates, meaning that  E ( r  \n n  ) is high, or they require a \nlarge premium for holding longer-term bonds. Although it is tempting to infer from a rising \nyield curve that investors believe that interest rates will eventually increase, this is not a valid inference. Indeed, panel A in  Figure\u00a015.4  provides a simple counter-example to this line of reasoning. There, the short rate is expected to stay at 5% forever. Yet there is a constant 1% liquidity premium so that all forward rates are 6%. The result is that the yield curve continu-ally rises, starting at a level of 5% for 1-year bonds, but eventually approaching 6% for long-term bonds as more and more forward rates at 6% are averaged into the yields to maturity. \n Therefore, although it is true that expectations of increases in future interest rates can \nresult in a rising yield curve, the converse is not true: A rising yield curve does not in and of itself imply expectations of higher future interest rates. The effects of possible liquidity premiums confound any simple attempt to extract expectations from the term structure. But estimating the market\u2019s expectations is crucial because only by comparing your own expectations to those reflected in market prices can you determine whether you are rela-tively bullish or bearish on interest rates. \n One very rough approach to deriving expected future spot rates is to assume that liquidity \npremiums are constant. An estimate of that premium can be subtracted from the forward rate to obtain the market\u2019s expected interest rate. For example, again making use of the example plotted in panel A of  Figure\u00a015.4 , the researcher would estimate from historical data that a typical liquidity premium in this economy is 1%. After calculating the forward rate from the yield curve to be 6%, the expectation of the future spot rate would be determined to be 5%. \n This approach has little to recommend it for two reasons. First, it is next to impossible \nto obtain precise estimates of a liquidity premium. The general approach to doing so would be to compare forward rates and eventually realized future short rates and to calculate the average difference between the two. However, the deviations between the two val-ues can be quite large and unpredictable because of unanticipated economic events that affect the realized short rate. The data are too noisy to calculate a reliable estimate of the expected premium. Second, there is no reason to believe that the liquidity premium should be constant.  Figure\u00a015.5  shows the rate of return variability of prices of long-term Treasury bonds since 1971. Interest rate risk fluctuated dramatically during the period. So we should expect risk premiums on various maturity bonds to fluctuate, and empirical evidence suggests that liquidity premiums do in fact fluctuate over time.   Look back at  Table\u00a015.1 . Show that  y  4  will exceed  y  3  if and only if the forward interest rate for period 4 is \ngreater than 7%, which is the yield to maturity on the 3-year bond,  y  3 .

The prediction of declining interest rates is in turn often interpreted as a \nsignal of a coming recession. Short-term rates exceeded long-term ones in each of the seven \nrecessions since 1970. For this reason, it is not surprising that the slope of the yield curve is \none of the key components of the index of leading economic indicators. \n  Figure\u00a015.6  presents a history of yields on 90-day Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury \nbonds. Yields on the longer-term bonds  generally   exceed those on the bills, mean-\ning that the yield curve generally slopes upward. Moreover, the exceptions to this rule \ndo seem to precede episodes of falling short rates, which, if anticipated, would induce a \ndownward-sloping yield curve. For example, the figure shows that 1980\u20131981 were years \nin which 90-day yields exceeded long-term yields. These years preceded both a drastic \ndrop in the general level of rates and a steep recession.  \n Why might interest rates fall? There are two factors to consider: the real rate and the \ninflation premium. Recall that the nominal interest rate is composed of the real rate plus a \nfactor to compensate for the effect of inflation:   \n11Nominal rate 5(11Real rate )(11Inflation rate )  \n or, approximately,\n   Nominal rate <Real rate 1Inflation rate  \n Therefore, an expected change in interest rates can be due to changes in either expected \nreal rates or expected inflation rates. Usually, it is important to distinguish between these \ntwo possibilities because the economic environments associated with them may vary sub-\nstantially. High real rates may indicate a rapidly expanding economy, high government \nbudget deficits, and tight monetary policy. Although high inflation rates can arise out of \na rapidly expanding economy, inflation also may be caused by rapid expansion of the \nmoney supply or supply-side shocks to the economy such as interruptions in oil supplies. \n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1971\n1973\n1975\n1977\n1979\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n20132011Standard Deviation of Monthly Returns (%)\n Figure 15.5 Price volatility of long-term Treasury bonds  \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   503bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   503 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n5 0 4 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\nThese factors have very different implications for investments.

But there is still an important sense in which \nthe forward rate is a market interest rate. Suppose that you wanted to arrange  now  to make \na loan at some future date. You would agree today on the interest rate that will be charged, \nbut the loan would not commence until some time in the future. How would the interest \nrate on such a \u201cforward loan\u201d be determined? Perhaps not surprisingly, it would be the \nforward rate of interest for the period of the loan. Let\u2019s use an example to see how this \nmight work. \n Suppose the price of 1-year maturity zero-coupon bonds with face value $1,000 is \n$952.38 and the price of 2-year zeros with $1,000 face value is $890. The yield to maturity \non the 1-year bond is therefore 5%, while that on the 2-year bond is 6%. The forward \nrate for the second year is thus\n   f25(1\u00a01\u00a0y2)2\n(1\u00a01\u00a0y1)2151.062\n1.05215.0701, or 7.01%   Example 15.7 Forward Interest Rate Contract \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   504bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   504 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 15 The Term Structure of Interest Rates 505\n Now consider the strategy laid out in the following table. In the first column we \npresent data for this example, and in the last column we generalize. We denote by  B  0 ( T ) \ntoday\u2019s price of a zero-coupon bond with face value $1,000 maturing at time  T.  \nInitial Cash Flow In General\nBuy a 1-year zero-coupon bond 2952.38 2B0(1)\nSell 1.0701 2-year zeros 1890\u00a03\u00a01.0701\u00a05\u00a0952.38 1B0(2)\u00a03\u00a0(1\u00a01\u00a0f2)\n  0 0\n The initial cash flow (at time 0) is zero. You pay $952.38, or in general  B  0 (1), for a zero \nmaturing in 1 year, and you receive $890, or in general  B  0 (2), for each zero you sell matur-\ning in 2 years. By selling 1.0701 of these bonds, you set your initial cash flow to zero.  4    \n At time 1, the 1-year bond matures and you receive $1,000. At time 2, the 2-year \nmaturity zer o-coupon bonds that you sold mature, and you have to pay 1.0701\u00a0  3 \u00a0\n$1,000\u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,070.10. Your cash flow stream is shown in  Figure\u00a015.7 , panel A. Notice \nthat you have created a \u201csynthetic\u201d forward loan: You effectively  will  borrow $1,000 a \nyear from now, and repay $1,070.10 a year later. The rate on this forward loan is there-\nfore 7.01%, precisely equal to the forward rate for the second year.  \n4 Of course, in reality one cannot sell a fraction of a bond, but you can think of this part of the transaction as \nfollows. If you sold one of these bonds, you would effectively be borrowing $890 for a 2-year period. Selling \n1.0701 of these bonds simply means that you are borrowing $890\u00a0 3 \u00a01.0701\u00a0 5 \u00a0$952.38.   In general, to construct the synthetic forward loan, you sell (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 f  2 ) 2-year zeros for \nevery 1-year zero that you buy. This makes your initial cash flow zero because the prices of \nthe 1- and 2-year zeros differ by the factor (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 f  2 ); notice that\n   B0(1)5$1,000\n(11y1)\u00a0\u00a0while\u00a0\u00a0B0(2)5$1,000\n(11y2)25$1,000\n(11y1)(11f2)  \n\u2212$1,070.10$1,000\n2 01\n\u2212$1,000(1 + f2)$1,000\n2 01r1 r2B:    For a General Forward Rate.

Both zeros mature to a face value of $1,000, so the difference between the \ncash inflow at time 1 and the cash outflow at time 2 is the same factor, 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 f  2 , as illustrated \nin  Figure\u00a015.7 , panel B. As a result,  f  2  is the rate on the forward loan. \n Obviously, you can construct a synthetic forward loan for periods beyond the second \nyear, and you can construct such loans for multiple periods. Challenge Problems 18 and 19 at the end of the chapter lead you through some of these variants.     \n Suppose that the price of 3-year zero-coupon bonds is $816.30. What is the forward rate for the third year? \nHow would you construct a synthetic 1-year forward loan that commences at  t \u00a0 5 \u00a02 and matures at  t \u00a0 5 \u00a03?  CONCEPT CHECK 15.9 \n     1 .   The term structure of interest rates refers to the interest rates for various terms to maturity embod-ied in the prices of default-free zero-coupon bonds.  \n    2 .   In a world of certainty all investments must provide equal total returns for any investment period. Short-term holding-period returns on all bonds would be equal in a risk-free economy, and all equal to the rate available on short-term bonds. Similarly, total returns from rolling over short-term bonds over longer periods would equal the total return available from long-maturity bonds.  \n    3 .   The forward rate of interest is the break-even future interest rate that would equate the total return from a rollover strategy to that of a longer-term zero-coupon bond. It is defined by the equation\n   (11y\nn)n(11fn11)5(11yn11)n11  \n   where  n  is a given number of periods from today. This equation can be used to show that yields to \nmaturity and forward rates are related by the equation\n   (11yn)n5(11r1)(11f2)(11f3)c(11fn)   \n    4 .   A common version of the expectations hypothesis holds that forward interest rates are unbiased estimates of expected future interest rates. However, there are good reasons to believe that for-ward rates differ from expected short rates because of a risk premium known as a  liquidity pre-\nmium.  A positive liquidity premium can cause the yield curve to slope upward even if no increase in short rates is anticipated.  \n    5 .   The existence of liquidity premiums makes it extremely difficult to infer expected future inter-est rates from the yield curve. Such an inference would be made easier if we could assume the liquidity premium remained reasonably stable over time. However, both empirical and theoretical considerations cast doubt on the constancy of that premium.  \n    6 .   Forward rates are market interest rates in the important sense that commitments to forward (i.e., deferred) borrowing or lending arrangements can be made at these rates.

The expectations hypothesis indicates a flat yield curve if anticipated future short-term rates \nexceed current short-term rates.  \n    b .   The expectations hypothesis contends that the long-term rate is equal to the anticipated short-\nterm rate.  \n    c.

Suppose that you want to construct a  2-year   \nmaturity forward loan commencing in 3 years.\n     a .   Suppose that you buy  today   one 3-year maturity zero-coupon bond.

The shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve appears to reflect two expected Federal Reserve \nreductions in the federal funds rate. The current short-term interest rate is 5%. The first reduc-\ntion of approximately 50 basis points (bp) is expected 6 months from now and the second reduction of approximately 50 bp is expected 1 year from now. The current U.S. Treasury term premiums are 10 bp per year for each of the next 3 years (out through the 3-year benchmark). \n However, the market also believes that the Federal Reserve reductions will be reversed in a \nsingle 100-bp increase in the federal funds rate 2\u00bd years from now.

This makes sense: This bond\u2019s coupon rate is lower than that of the bond in Example 15.1. A greater fraction of its value is tied up in the final payment in the third year, and so it is not surprising that its yield is closer to that of a pure 3-year zero-coupon security.  \n   2. We compare two investment strategies in a manner similar to Example 15.2:\n    B u y  a n\nd hold 4-year zero 5Buy 3-year zero; ro ll procee ds into 1-year bond\n (11y4)45(11y3)33(11r4)\n 1.08451.0733(11r4)   \n   which implies that  r  4 \u00a0 5 \u00a01.08 4 /1.07 3 \u00a0 2 \u00a01\u00a0 5 \u00a0.11056\u00a0 5 \u00a011.056%.

The 3-year bond can be bought today for $1,000/1.07 3 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 $816.30. Next year, it will have a \nremaining maturity of 2 years. The short rate in year 2 will be 7.01% and the short rate in year 3 \nwill be 9.025%. Therefore, the bond\u2019s yield to maturity next year will be related to these short rates according to\n   (11y\n2)251.070131.09025 51.1667  \n   and its price next year will be $1,000/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y  2 ) 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,000/1.1667\u00a0 5 \u00a0$857.12.

The  n -period  spot  rate is the yield to maturity on a zero-coupon bond with a maturity of  n  periods. \nThe  short  rate for period  n  is the  one-period  interest rate that will prevail in period  n.  Finally, the \n forward  rate for period  n  is the short rate that would satisfy a \u201cbreak-even condition\u201d equating \nthe total returns on two  n -period investment strategies. The first strategy is an investment in an \n n -period zero-coupon bond; the second is an investment in an  n \u00a0 2 \u00a01 period zero-coupon bond \n\u201crolled over\u201d into an investment in a one-period zero. Spot rates and forward rates are observable \ntoday, but because interest rates evolve with uncertainty, future short rates are not.  In the special \ncase  in which there is no uncertainty in future interest rates, the forward rate calculated from the yield curve would equal the short rate that will prevail in that period.  \n   5. 7%\u00a0 2 \u00a01%\u00a0 5 \u00a06%.  \nbod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   513bod61671_ch15_487-514.indd   513 7/17/13   4:03 PM7/17/13   4:03 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm514 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n   6.

A  passive investment \nstrategy  takes market prices of securities as \nset fairly. Rather than attempting to beat the market by exploiting superior infor-mation or insight, passive managers act to maintain an appropriate risk\u2013return balance given market opportunities. One special case of passive management is an immuni-zation strategy that attempts to insulate or immunize the portfolio from interest rate risk. In contrast, an  active investment strat-\negy  attempts to achieve returns greater than \nthose commensurate with the risk borne. In the context of bond management this style of management can take two forms. Active managers use either interest rate forecasts to predict movements in the entire bond market or some form of intramarket analy-sis to identify particular sectors of the mar-ket or particular bonds that are relatively mispriced.  Because interest rate risk is crucial to for-\nmulating both active and passive strategies, \nwe begin our discussion with an analysis of the sensitivity of bond prices to interest rate fluctuations. This sensitivity is measured by the duration of the bond, and we devote con-siderable attention to what determines bond duration. We discuss several passive invest-ment strategies, and show how duration-matching techniques can be used to immunize the holding-period return of a portfolio from interest rate risk. After examining the broad range of applications of the duration mea-sure, we consider refinements in the way that interest rate sensitivity is measured, focusing on the concept of bond convexity. Duration is important in formulating active investment strategies as well, and we conclude the chap-ter with a discussion of active fixed-income strategies. These include policies based on interest rate forecasting as well as intramar-ket analysis that seeks to identify relatively attractive sectors or securities within the fixed-income market.

As interest rates rise and fall, bondholders expe-\nrience capital losses and gains. These gains or losses make fixed-income investments \nrisky, even if the coupon and principal payments are guaranteed, as in the case of Treasury \nobligations. \n Why do bond prices respond to interest rate fluctuations? Remember that in a \ncompetitive market all securities must offer investors fair expected rates of return. \nIf a bond is issued with an 8% coupon when competitive yields are 8%, then it will sell at \npar value. If the market rate rises to 9%, however, who would purchase an 8% coupon bond \nat par value? The bond price must fall until its expected return increases to the competi-\ntive level of 9%. Conversely, if the market rate falls to 7%, the 8% coupon on the bond is \nattractive compared to yields on alternative investments. In response, investors eager for \nthat return would bid up the bond price until the total rate of return for someone purchasing \nat that higher price is no better than the market rate.  \n   Interest Rate Sensitivity \n The sensitivity of bond prices to changes in market interest rates is obviously of great \nconcern to investors. To gain some insight into the determinants of interest rate risk, turn \nto  Figure\u00a016.1 , which presents the percentage change in price corresponding to changes \nin yield to maturity for four bonds that differ according to coupon rate, initial yield to \nmaturity, and time to maturity.

We summarize these obser-vations in the following two propositions:  \n    1 .   Bond prices and yields are inversely related: as yields increase, bond prices fall; as \nyields fall, bond prices rise.   \n   2.  An increase in a bond\u2019s yield to maturity results in a smaller price change than a \ndecrease in yield of equal magnitude.    \n Now compare the interest rate sensitivity of bonds  A  and  B,  which are identical except for \nmaturity.  Figure\u00a016.1  shows that bond  B,  which has a longer maturity than bond  A,  exhibits \ngreater sensitivity to interest rate changes. This illustrates another general property: \n    3 .   Prices of long-term bonds tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than \nprices of short-term bonds.    \n This is not surprising. If rates increase, for example, the bond is less valuable as its cash flows are discounted at a now-higher rate. The impact of the higher discount rate will be greater as that rate is applied to more-distant cash flows. \n Notice that while bond  B  has six times the maturity of bond  A,  it has less than six times \nthe interest rate sensitivity. Although interest rate sensitivity seems to increase with matu-rity, it does so less than proportionally as bond maturity increases. Therefore, our fourth property is that: \n    4 .   The sensitivity of bond prices to changes in yields increases at a decreasing rate \nas maturity increases. In other words, interest rate risk is less than proportional to bond maturity.    \n Bonds  B  and  C,  which are alike in all respects except for coupon rate, illustrate another \npoint. The lower-coupon bond exhibits greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates. This turns out to be a general property of bond prices: \n    5 .   Interest rate risk is inversely related to the bond\u2019s coupon rate. Prices of \nlow-coupon bonds are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than prices of high-coupon bonds.    \n Finally, bonds  C  and  D  are identical except for the yield to maturity at which the bonds \ncurrently sell. Yet bond  C,  with a higher yield to maturity, is less sensitive to changes in \nyields. This illustrates our final property: \n    6 .   The sensitivity of a bond\u2019s price to a change in its yield is inversely related to the \nyield to maturity at which the bond currently is selling.    \n The first five of these general properties were described by Malkiel  \n1   and are sometimes \nknown as Malkiel\u2019s bond-pricing relationships. The last property was demonstrated by Homer and Liebowitz.  \n2    \n Maturity is a major determinant of interest rate risk. However, maturity alone is not suffi-\ncient to measure interest rate sensitivity. For example, bonds  B  and  C  in  Figure\u00a016.1  have the \nsame maturity, but the higher-coupon bond has less price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Obviously, we need to know more than a bond\u2019s maturity to quantify its interest rate risk. \n  1 Burton G.

Table\u00a016.1  gives bond prices \nfor 8% semiannual coupon bonds at different yields to maturity and times to maturity,  T.\n[The interest rates are expressed as annual percentage rates (APRs), meaning that the true \n6-month yield is doubled to obtain the stated annual yield.] The shortest-term bond falls in \nvalue by less than 1% when the interest rate increases from 8% to 9%. The 10-year bond \nfalls by 6.5%, and the 20-year bond by over 9%.  \n Now look at a similar computation using a zero-coupon bond rather than the 8% coupon \nbond. The results are shown in  Table\u00a016.2 . Notice that for each maturity, the price of the \nzero-coupon bond falls by a greater proportional amount than the price of the 8% coupon \nbond. Because we know that long-term bonds are more sensitive to interest rate movements \nthan are short-term bonds, this observation suggests that in some sense a zero-coupon bond \nmust represent a longer-term bond than an equal-time-to-maturity coupon bond.  \n In fact, this insight about the effective maturity of a bond is a useful one that we can \nmake mathematically precise. To start, note that the times to maturity of the two bonds in \nthis example are not perfect measures of the long- or short-term nature of the bonds. The \n20-year 8% bond makes many coupon payments, most of which come years before the \nbond\u2019s maturity date. Each of these payments may be considered to have its own \u201cmaturity.\u201d \nIn the previous chapter, we pointed out that it can be useful to view a coupon bond as a \n\u201cportfolio\u201d of coupon payments. The effective maturity of the bond is therefore some sort \nof average of the maturities of  all  the cash flows. The zero-coupon bond, by contrast, makes \nonly one payment at maturity. Its time to maturity is, therefore, a well-defined concept. \n Higher-coupon-rate bonds have a higher fraction of value tied to coupons rather than \nfinal payment of par value, and so the \u201cportfolio of coupons\u201d is more heavily weighted \ntoward the earlier, short-maturity payments, which gives it lower \u201ceffective maturity.\u201d This \nexplains Malkiel\u2019s fifth rule, that price sensitivity falls with coupon rate. \n Similar logic explains our sixth rule, that price sensitivity falls with yield to maturity. A \nhigher yield reduces the present value of all of the bond\u2019s payments, but more so for more-\ndistant payments. Therefore, at a higher yield, a higher fraction of the bond\u2019s value is due \nto its earlier payments, which have lower effective maturity and interest rate sensitivity. \nThe overall sensitivity of the bond price to changes in yields is thus lower.  \n Table 16.1 \n Prices of 8% coupon bond \n(coupons paid semiannually) Yield to Maturity (APR) T 5 1 Year T 5 10 Years T 5 20 Years\n8% 1,000.00 1,000.00 1,000.00\n9% 990.64 934.96 907.99\nFall in price (%)* 0.94% 6.50% 9.20%\n  *Equals value of bond at a 9% yield to maturity divided by value of bond at (the original) 8% \nyield, minus 1.  \nYield to Maturity (APR) T 5 1 Year T 5 10 Years T 5 20 Years\n8% 924.56 456.39 208.29\n9% 915.73 414.64 171.93\nFall in price (%)* 0.96% 9.15% 17.46%\n  *Equals value of bond at a 9% yield to maturity divided by value of bond at (the original) 8% \nyield, minus 1.

We would like also to \nuse such an effective maturity measure as a guide to the sensitivity of a bond to interest rate \nchanges, because we have noted that price sensitivity tends to increase with time to maturity. \n Frederick Macaulay  3   termed the effective maturity concept the  duration   of the bond. \n   Macaulay\u2019s duration    equals the weighted average of the times to each coupon or princi-\npal payment. The weight associated with each payment time clearly should be related to \nthe \u201cimportance\u201d of that payment to the value of the bond. In fact, the weight applied \nto each payment time is the proportion of the total value of the bond accounted for by that \npayment, that is, the present value of the payment divided by the bond price.  \n We define the weight,  w   t  , associated with the cash flow made at time  t  (denoted CF  t   ) as:   \nwt5CFt /(11y) t\nBond price  \n where  y  is the bond\u2019s yield to maturity. The numerator on the right-hand side of this equa-\ntion is the present value of the cash flow occurring at time  t  while the denominator is the \nvalue of all the bond\u2019s payments. These weights sum to 1.0 because the sum of the cash \nflows discounted at the yield to maturity equals the bond price. \n Using these values to calculate the weighted average of the times until the receipt of \neach of the bond\u2019s payments, we obtain Macaulay\u2019s duration formula:   \n D5aT\nt51t3wt  (16.1)   \n3 Frederick Macaulay,  Some Theoretical Problems Suggested by the Movements of Interest Rates, Bond Yields, and \nStock Prices in the United States since 1856   (New York: National Bureau of Economic Research, 1938). \n Spreadsheet 16.1\nCalculating the duration of two bonds  \n  Column sums subject to rounding error.

We \nassume that the yield to maturity on each bond is 10%, or 5% per half-year. The present \nvalue of each payment is discounted at 5% per period for the number of (semiannual) peri-\nods shown in column B. The weight associated with each payment time (column F) is the \npresent value of the payment for that period (column E) divided by the bond price (the sum \nof the present values in column E).   \n The numbers in column G are the products of time to payment and payment weight. \nEach of these products corresponds to one of the terms in Equation 16.1. According to that \nequation, we can calculate the duration of each bond by adding the numbers in column G. \n The duration of the zero-coupon bond is exactly equal to its time to maturity, 2 years. \nThis makes sense, because with only one payment, the average time until payment must \nbe the bond\u2019s maturity.

First, as we have noted, it is a simple summary statistic of the effective average matu-\nrity of the portfolio. Second, it turns out to be an essential tool in immunizing portfolios from interest rate risk. We explore this application in Section 16.3. Third, duration is a measure of the interest rate sensitivity of a portfolio, which we explore here. \n We have seen that a bond\u2019s price sensitivity to interest rate changes generally increases \nwith maturity. Duration enables us to quantify this relationship. Specifically, it can be shown that when interest rates change, the proportional change in a bond\u2019s price can be related to the change in its yield to maturity,  y,  according to the rule\n    DP\nP52 D3BD(11y)\n11yR  (16.2)   \n The proportional price change equals the proportional change in 1 plus the bond\u2019s yield times the bond\u2019s duration. \n Practitioners commonly use Equation 16.2 in a slightly different form. They define \n   modified duration    as  D *\u00a0 5 \u00a0 D /(1\u00a0 1  \u00a0 y ), note that D (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y )\u00a0 5 \u00a0D y,  and rewrite Equation 16.2 as\n    DP\nP52 D*Dy  (16.3)   \n The percentage change in bond price is just the product of modified duration and the \nchange in the bond\u2019s yield to maturity. Because the percentage change in the bond price is proportional to modified duration, modified duration is a natural measure of the bond\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates. Actually, as we will see below, Equation 16.2, or equivalently 16.3, is only approximately valid for large changes in the bond\u2019s yield. The approximation becomes exact as one considers smaller, or localized, changes in yields.  \n4  \n Consider the 2-year maturity, 8% coupon bond in  Spreadsheet\u00a016.1  making semiannual \ncoupon payments and selling at a price of $964.540, for a yield to maturity of 10%. \nThe duration of this bond is 1.8852 years. For comparison, we will also consider a zero-coupon bond with maturity  and duration  of 1.8852 years. As we found in \n Spreadsheet\u00a016.1 , because the coupon bond makes payments semiannually, it is best to \ntreat one \u201cperiod\u201d as a half-year. So the duration of each bond is 1.8852\u00a0 3 \u00a02\u00a0 5 \u00a03.7704 \n(semiannual) periods, with a per period interest rate of 5%. The modified duration of each bond is therefore 3.7704/1.05\u00a0 5 \u00a03.591 periods. \n Suppose the semiannual interest rate increases from 5% to 5.01%. According to \nEquation 16.3, the bond prices should fall by   \nDP/P 5 2D*Dy 5 23.591 3 .01% 5 2.03591%   Example 16.1 Duration and Interest Rate Risk \n  4 Students of calculus will recognize that modified duration is proportional to the derivative of the bond\u2019s price \nwith respect to changes in the bond\u2019s yield. For small changes in yield, Equation 16.3 can be restated as   \nD*521\nP dP\ndy  \n As such, it gives a measure of the slope of the bond price curve only in the neighborhood of the current price. \nIn fact, Equation 16.3 can be derived by differentiating the following bond pricing equation with respect to  y:    \nP5aT\nt51CFt\n(11y)t  \n where CF  t   is the cash flow paid to the bondholder at date  t;  CF  t   represents either a coupon payment before \nmaturity or final coupon plus par value at the maturity date. \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   521bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   521 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n522 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n       What Determines Duration? \n Malkiel\u2019s bond price relations, which we laid out in the previous section, characterize the \ndeterminants of interest rate sensitivity. Duration allows us to quantify that sensitivity. For example, if we wish to speculate on interest rates, duration tells us how strong a bet we are making. Conversely, if we wish to remain \u201cneutral\u201d on rates, and simply match the interest rate sensitivity of a chosen bond-market index, duration allows us to measure that sensitiv-ity and mimic it in our own portfolio. For these reasons, it is crucial to understand the deter-minants of duration. Therefore, in this section, we present several \u201crules\u201d that summarize most of its important properties. These rules are also illustrated in  Figure\u00a016.2 , where dura-tions of bonds of various coupon rates, yields to maturity, and times to maturity are plotted.  \n We have already established: \n  Rule 1 for Duration   The duration of a zero-coupon bond equals its time to maturity. \n We have also seen that a coupon bond has a lower duration than a zero with equal matu-\nrity because coupons early in the bond\u2019s life lower the bond\u2019s weighted average time until \npayments. This illustrates another general property:  \n  Rule 2 for Duration   Holding maturity constant, a bond\u2019s duration is lower when the \ncoupon rate is higher. \n This property corresponds to Malkiel\u2019s fifth relationship and is attributable to the impact \nof early coupon payments on the weighted-average maturity of a bond\u2019s payments. The \nhigher these coupons, the higher the weights on the early payments and the lower is the weighted average maturity of the payments. In other words, a higher fraction of the total value of the bond is tied up in the (earlier) coupon payments whose values are relatively insensitive to yields rather than the (later and more yield-sensitive) repayment of par value. Compare the plots in  Figure\u00a0 16.2  of the durations of the 3% coupon and 15% coupon  Now compute the price change of each bond directly. The coupon bond, which initially \nsells at $964.540, falls to $964.1942 when its yield increases to 5.01%, which is a per-\ncentage decline of .0359%. The zero-coupon bond initially sells for $1,000/1.05 3.7704   5  \n831.9704. At the higher yield, it sells for $1,000/1.0501 3.7704 \u00a0  5  831.6717. This price \nalso falls by .0359%. \n We conclude that bonds with equal durations do in fact have equal interest rate \nsensitivity and that (at least for small changes in yields) the percentage price change is \nthe modified duration times the change in yield.  5    \n  5 Notice another implication of Example 16.1: We see from the example that when the bond makes payments \nsemiannually, it is convenient to treat each payment period as a half-year. This implies that when we calculate \nmodified duration, we divided Macaulay\u2019s duration by (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0Semiannual yield to maturity). It is more common \nto write this divisor as (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0Bond equivalent yield/2). In general, if a bond were to make  n  payments a year, \nmodified duration would be related to Macaulay\u2019s duration by  D *\u00a0 5 \u00a0 D /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y  BEY / n ).      a.  In Concept Check 1, you calculated the price and duration of a 2-year maturity, 8% coupon bond mak-\ning semiannual coupon payments when the market interest rate is 9%. Now suppose the interest rate increases to 9.05%. Calculate the new value of the bond and the percentage change in the bond\u2019s price.  \n    b.  Calculate the percentage change in the bond\u2019s price predicted by the duration formula in Equation 16.2 or 16.3. Compare this value to your answer for (a).

The plot of the duration of the 15% coupon bond \nlies below the corresponding plot for the 3% coupon bond.  \n  Rule 3 for Duration   Holding the coupon rate constant, a bond\u2019s duration generally \nincreases with its time to maturity. Duration always increases with maturity for bonds \nselling at par or at a premium to par. \n This property of duration corresponds to Malkiel\u2019s third relationship, and it is fairly \nintuitive. What is surprising is that duration need not always increase with time to \nmaturity. It turns out that for some deep-discount bonds (such as the 3% coupon bond in \n Figure\u00a016.2 ), duration may eventually fall with increases in maturity. However, for virtu-\nally all traded bonds it is safe to assume that duration increases with maturity. \n Notice in  Figure\u00a016.2  that for the zero-coupon bond, maturity and duration are equal. \nHowever, for coupon bonds, duration increases by less than a year with a year\u2019s increase in \nmaturity. The slope of the duration graph is less than 1.0. \n Although long-maturity bonds generally will be high-duration bonds, duration is a \nbetter measure of the long-term nature of the bond because it also accounts for coupon \npayments. Time to maturity is an adequate statistic only when the bond pays no coupons; \nthen, maturity and duration are equal. \n Notice also in  Figure\u00a0 16.2  that the two 15% coupon bonds have different durations \nwhen they sell at different yields to maturity. The lower-yield bond has longer duration. \nThis makes sense, because at lower yields the more distant payments made by the bond \nhave relatively greater present values and account for a greater share of the bond\u2019s total \nvalue. Thus in the weighted-average calculation of duration the distant payments receive \ngreater weights, which results in a higher duration measure. This establishes rule 4:  \n  Rule 4 for Duration   Holding other factors constant, the duration of a coupon bond \nis higher when the bond\u2019s yield to maturity is lower. \n Figure 16.2 Bond duration versus bond maturity  \nDuration (years)Zero-Coupon Bond\n15% Coupon YTM = 15%3% Coupon YTM = 15%15% Coupon YTM = 6%\n02468 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 4 2 6 2 8 3 0\nMaturity30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   523bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   523 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n5 2 4 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n As we noted above, the intuition for this property is that while a higher yield reduces the \npresent value of all of the bond\u2019s payments, it reduces the value of more-distant payments \nby a greater proportional amount. Therefore, at higher yields a higher fraction of the total \nvalue of the bond lies in its earlier payments, thereby reducing effective maturity. Rule 4, \nwhich is the sixth bond-pricing relationship above, applies to coupon bonds. For zeros, of \ncourse, duration equals time to maturity, regardless of the yield to maturity. \n Finally, we present a formula for the duration of a perpetuity. This rule is derived from \nand consistent with the formula for duration given in Equation 16.1 but may be easier to \nuse for infinitely lived bonds.  \n  Rule 5 for Duration   The duration of a level perpetuity is   \nDuration of perpetuity 511y\ny  (16.4)   \n For example, at a 10% yield, the duration of a perpetuity that pays $100 once a year forever \nis 1.10/.10\u00a0 5 \u00a011 years, but at an 8% yield it is 1.08/.08\u00a0 5 \u00a013.5 years.  \n Show that the duration of the perpetuity increases as the interest rate decreases in accordance with rule 4.  CONCEPT CHECK 16.3 \n Equation 16.4 makes it obvious that maturity and duration can differ substantially. The \nmaturity of the perpetuity is infinite, whereas the duration of the instrument at a 10% yield \nis only 11 years. The present-value-weighted cash flows early on in the life of the perpetu-\nity dominate the computation of duration. \n Notice from  Figure\u00a016.2  that as their maturities become ever longer, the durations of the \ntwo coupon bonds with yields of 15% both converge to the duration of the perpetuity with \nthe same yield, 7.67 years. \n The equations for the durations of coupon bonds are somewhat tedious and spreadsheets \nlike  Spreadsheet\u00a016.1  are cumbersome to modify for different maturities and coupon rates. \nMoreover, they assume that the bond is at the beginning of a coupon payment period. Fortu-\nnately, spreadsheet programs such as Excel come with generalizations of these equations that \ncan accommodate bonds between coupon payment dates.

Use  Spreadsheet\u00a016.3  to test some of the rules for duration presented a few pages ago. What happens \nto duration when you change the coupon rate of the bond? The yield to maturity? The maturity? What \nhappens to duration if the bond pays its coupons annually rather than semiannually? Why intuitively is \nduration shorter with semiannual coupons?  CONCEPT CHECK 16.4 \n Durations can vary widely among traded bonds.  Table\u00a0 16.3  presents durations com-\nputed from  Spreadsheet\u00a016.3  for several bonds all paying semiannual coupons and yielding \n4% per half-year. Notice that duration decreases as coupon rates increase, and increases \nwith time to maturity. According to  Table\u00a016.3  and Equation 16.2, if the interest rate were \nto increase from 8% to 8.1%, the 6% coupon 20-year bond would fall in value by about \n10.922\u00a0 3 \u00a0.1%/1.04\u00a0 5 \u00a01.05%, whereas the 10% coupon 1-year bond would fall by only \n.976\u00a0 3 \u00a0.1%/1.04\u00a0 5 \u00a0.094%.  6   Notice also from  Table\u00a016.3  that duration is independent of \ncoupon rate only for perpetuities.        \n  As a measure of interest rate sensitivity, duration clearly is a key tool in fixed-income \nportfolio management. Yet the duration rule for the impact of interest rates on bond prices \nis only an approximation. Equation 16.2, or its equivalent, 16.3, which we repeat here, \nstates that the percentage change in the value of a bond approximately equals the product \nof modified duration times the change in the bond\u2019s yield:   \nDP\nP52 D*Dy     16.2 Convexity \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   525bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   525 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n5 2 6 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n This equation asserts that \nthe percentage price change \nis directly proportional to the \nchange in the bond\u2019s yield. \nIf this were  exactly   so, how-\never, a graph of the percent-\nage change in bond price as a \nfunction of the change in its \nyield would plot as a straight \nline, with slope equal to \n 2  D *. Yet  Figure\u00a016.1  makes \nit clear that the relationship \nbetween bond prices and \nyields is  not  linear. The dura-\ntion rule is a good approxi-\nmation for small changes \nin bond yield, but it is less \naccurate for larger changes. \n  Figure\u00a016.3  illustrates this \npoint. Like  Figure\u00a0 16.1 , the \nfigure presents the percent-\nage change in bond price in \nresponse to a change in the \nbond\u2019s yield to maturity. The \ncurved line is the percentage price change for a 30-year maturity, 8% annual payment cou-\npon bond, selling at an initial yield to maturity of 8%. The straight line is the percentage \nprice change predicted by the duration rule. The slope of the straight line is the modified \nduration of the bond at its initial yield to maturity. The modified duration of the bond at this \nyield is 11.26 years, so the straight line is a plot of  2  D *D y \u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 11.26\u00a0 3 \u00a0D y.  Notice that \nthe two plots are tangent at the initial yield. Thus for small changes in the bond\u2019s yield to \nmaturity, the duration rule is quite accurate. However, for larger changes in yield, there is \nprogressively more \u201cdaylight\u201d between the two plots, demonstrating that the duration rule \nbecomes progressively less accurate. \n Notice from  Figure\u00a0 16.3  that the duration approximation (the straight line) always \nunderstates the value of the bond; it underestimates the increase in bond price when the \nyield falls, and it overestimates the decline in price when the yield rises. This is due to the \ncurvature of the true price-yield relationship. Curves with shapes such as that of the price-\nyield relationship are said to be  convex,   and the curvature of the price-yield curve is called \nthe    convexity    of the bond. \n We can quantify convexity as the rate of change of the slope of the price-yield curve, \nexpressed as a fraction of the bond price.  7   As a practical rule, you can view bonds with \nhigher convexity as exhibiting higher curvature in the price-yield relationship. The \n  7 We pointed out in footnote 4 that Equation 16.3 for modified duration can be written as  dP / P \u00a0 5 \u00a0 2  D * dy.  Thus \n D *\u00a0 5 \u00a01/ P \u00a0 3 \u00a0 dP / dy  is the slope of the price-yield curve expressed as a fraction of the bond price. Similarly, the \nconvexity of a bond equals the  second   derivative (the rate of change of the slope) of the price-yield curve divided \nby bond price: Convexity\u00a0 5 \u00a01/ P \u00a0 3 \u00a0 d   2  P  /  dy   2 .

The second term is the modification for convexity. Notice that for a bond with positive convex-ity, the second term is positive, regardless of whether the yield rises or falls. This insight corresponds to the fact noted just above that the duration rule always underestimates the new value of a bond following a change in its yield. The more accurate Equation 16.5, which accounts for convexity, always predicts a higher bond price than Equation 16.2. Of course, if the change in yield is small, the convexity term, which is multiplied by ( D y ) \n2  in \nEquation 16.5, will be extremely small and will add little to the approximation. In this case, \nthe linear approximation given by the duration rule will be sufficiently accurate. Thus con-vexity is more important as a practical matter when potential interest rate changes are large.  \n  8 To use the convexity rule, you must express interest rates as decimals rather than percentages.  The bond in  Figure\u00a016.3  has a 30-year maturity, an 8% coupon, and sells at an initial \nyield to maturity of 8%. Because the coupon rate equals yield to maturity, the bond sells \nat par value, or $1,000. The modified duration of the bond at its initial yield is 11.26 years, and its convexity is 212.4, which can be verified using the formula in footnote 7. (You can find a spreadsheet to calculate the convexity of a 30-year bond at the Online Learning Center at   www.mhhe.com/bkm.    ) If the bond\u2019s yield increases from 8% \nto 10%, the bond price will fall to $811.46, a decline of 18.85%. The duration rule, \nEquation 16.2, would predict a price decline of\n   \nDP\nP 5 2D*Dy 5 211.26 3 .02 5 2.2252, or 222.52%  \n which is considerably more than the bond price actually falls. The duration-with-convexity \nrule, Equation 16.4, is far more accurate:   \nDP\nP 5 2D*Dy 1 \u00bd 3 Convexity 3 (Dy)2\n5 211.26 3 .02 1 \u00bd 3 212.4 3 (.02)2 5 2.1827, or 218.27%  \n which is far closer to the exact change in bond price. (Notice that when we use Equation \n16.5, we must express interest rates as decimals rather than percentages. The change in rates from 8% to 10% is represented as D y \u00a0 5 \u00a0.02.) \n If the change in yield were smaller, say, .1%, convexity would matter less. The price of \nthe bond actually would fall to $988.85, a decline of 1.115%. Without accounting for \nconvexity, we would predict a price decline of   \nDP\nP 5 2D*Dy 5 211.26 3 .001 5 2.01126, or 21.126%  \n Accounting for convexity, we get almost the precisely correct answer:   \nDP\nP 5 211.26 3 .001 1 \u00bd 3 212.4 3 (.001)2 5 2.01115, or 21.115%  \n Nevertheless, the duration rule is quite accurate in this case, even without accounting \nfor convexity.

Bonds \nwith greater curvature gain \nmore in price when yields \nfall than they lose when \nyields rise. For example, in \n Figure\u00a0 16.4  bonds  A  and  B\nhave the same duration at the \ninitial yield. The plots of their \nproportional price changes \nas a function of interest rate \nchanges are tangent, mean-\ning that their sensitivities to \nchanges in yields at that point \nare equal. However, bond  A  is \nmore convex than bond  B.  It \nenjoys greater price increases \nand smaller price decreases \nwhen interest rates fluctuate \nby larger amounts. If inter-\nest rates are volatile, this is an attractive asymmetry that increases the expected return on \nthe bond, because bond  A  will benefit more from rate decreases and suffer less from rate \nincreases. Of course, if convexity is desirable, it will not be available for free: Investors \nwill have to pay higher prices and accept lower yields to maturity on bonds with greater \nconvexity.   \n  Duration and Convexity of Callable Bonds \n Look at  Figure\u00a016.5 , which depicts the price-yield curve for a callable bond. When inter-\nest rates are high, the curve is convex, as it would be for a straight bond. For example, at \nan interest rate of 10%, the price-yield curve lies above its tangency line. But as rates fall, \nthere is a ceiling on the possible price: The bond cannot be worth more than its call price. \nSo as rates fall, we sometimes say that the bond is subject to price compression\u2014its value \nis \u201ccompressed\u201d to the call price. In this region, for example at an interest rate of 5%, \nthe price-yield curve lies  below   its tangency line, and the curve is said to have  negative \nconvexity.    9     \n Notice that in the region of negative convexity, the price-yield curve exhibits an \nunattractive   asymmetry. Interest rate increases result in a larger price decline than the price \ngain corresponding to an interest rate decrease of equal magnitude. The asymmetry arises \nfrom the fact that the bond issuer has retained an option to call back the bond. If rates \nrise, the bondholder loses, as would be the case for a straight bond. But if rates fall, rather \nthan reaping a large capital gain, the investor may have the bond called back from her. \nThe bondholder is thus in a \u201cheads I lose, tails I don\u2019t win\u201d position. Of course, she was \ncompensated for this unattractive situation when she purchased the bond. Callable bonds \nsell at lower initial prices (higher initial yields) than otherwise comparable straight bonds. \n9 If you\u2019ve taken a calculus course, you will recognize that the curve is  concave   in this region. However, rather \nthan saying that these bonds exhibit concavity, bond traders prefer the terminology \u201cnegative convexity.\u201d \nPercentage Change in Bond Price\nChange in Yield to Maturity (%)Bond A\nBond B100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\u221220\n\u221240\n\u221260\n\u22125\n\u22124\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n Figure 16.4 Convexity of two bonds  \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   528bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   528 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 16 Managing Bond Portfolios 529\n The effect of negative convexity is highlighted in Equation 16.5. When convexity is \nnegative, the second term on the right-hand side is necessarily negative, meaning that bond \nprice performance will be worse than would be predicted by the duration approximation. \nHowever, callable bonds or, more generally, bonds with \u201cembedded options,\u201d are diffi-\ncult to analyze in terms of Macaulay\u2019s duration. This is because in the presence of such \noptions, the future cash flows provided by the bonds are no longer known. If the bond may \nbe called, for example, its cash flow stream may be terminated and its principal repaid \nearlier than was initially anticipated. Because cash flows are random, we can hardly take a \nweighted average of times until each future cash flow, as would be necessary to compute \nMacaulay\u2019s duration. \n The convention on Wall Street is to compute the    effective duration    of bonds with \nembedded options. Effective duration cannot be computed with a simple formula such as \n16.1 that requires known cash flows. Instead, more complex bond valuation approaches \nthat account for the embedded options are used, and effective duration is  defined   as the \nproportional change in the bond price per unit change in market interest rates:   \nEffective duration 52DP/P\nDr  (16.6)   \n This equation  seems   merely like a slight manipulation of the modified duration formula \n16.3. However, there are important differences. First, note that we do not compute effec-\ntive duration relative to a change in the bond\u2019s own yield to maturity. (The denominator is \nD  r,  not D y . ) This is because for bonds with embedded options, which may be called early, \nthe yield to maturity is often not a relevant statistic. Instead, we calculate price change \nrelative to a shift in the level of the term structure of interest rates. Second, the effective \nduration formula relies on a pricing methodology that accounts for embedded options. \n Figure 16.5 Price-yield curve for a callable bond  \nBond PriceRegion of Negative Convexity\n(Price-yield curve is below its \n tangency line.)\nRegion of \nPositive\nConvexity\n05% 10%\nInterest RateCall\nPrice\nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   529bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   529 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n530 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\nThis means that the effective duration will be a function of variables that would not matter \nto conventional duration, for example, the volatility of interest rates. In contrast, modified or Macaulay duration can be computed directly from the promised bond cash flows and yield to maturity.    \n Suppose that a callable bond with a call price of $1,050 is selling today for $980. If the \nyield curve shifts up by .5%, the bond price will fall to $930. If it shifts down by .5%, the bond price will rise to $1,010. To compute effective duration, we compute:   \nDr 5 Assumed increase in rates 2 Assumed decrease in rates\n5 .5% 2 (2.5%) 5 1% 5 .01\nDP 5 Price at .5% increase in rates 2 Price at .5% decrease in rates\n5 $930 2 $1,010 5 2$80  \n Then the effective duration of the bond is   \nEffective duration 52DP/P\nDr522$80/$980\n.0158.16 years   \n In other words, the bond price changes by 8.16% for a 1 percentage point swing in \nrates around current values.  Example 16.3 Effective Duration \n What are the differences between Macaulay duration, modified duration, and \neffective duration?  CONCEPT CHECK 16.5 \n  Duration and Convexity of Mortgage-Backed Securities \n In practice, the biggest market for which call provisions are important is the market for \nmortgage-backed securities. In recent years, firms have been less apt to issue bonds with call provisions, and the number of outstanding callable corporate bonds has steadily declined. In contrast, the mortgage-backed market grew rapidly over the last two decades, at least until the financial crisis. Even in 2012, however, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together issued more than $1 trillion of new mortgage-backed securities. \n As described in Chapter 1, lenders that originate mortgage loans commonly sell those \nloans to federal agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie Mac). The original borrowers (the homeowners) continue to make their monthly payments to their lenders, but the lenders pass these payments along to the agency that has purchased the loan. In turn, the agencies may combine many mortgages into a pool called a mortgage-backed security, and then sell that security in the fixed-income market. These securities are called  pass-throughs  because the cash flows from the borrowers are first passed through \nto the agency (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) and then passed through again to the ultimate purchaser of the mortgage-backed security. \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   530bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   530 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 16 Managing Bond Portfolios 531\n As an example, suppose that ten 30-year mortgages, each with principal value of \n$100,000, are grouped together into a million-dollar pool. If the mortgage rate is 8%, then \nthe monthly payment on each loan would be $733.76. (The interest component of the first \npayment is .08\u00a0 3 \u00a01/12\u00a0 3 \u00a0$100,000\u00a0 5 \u00a0$666.67; the remaining $67.09 is \u201camortization,\u201d \nor scheduled repayment of principal. In later periods, with a lower principal balance, less \nof the monthly payments goes to interest and more to amortization.) The owner of the \nmortgage-backed security would receive $7,337.60, the total payment from the 10 mort-\ngages in the pool.  10    \n But now recall that the homeowner has the right to prepay the loan at any time. For \nexample, if mortgage rates go down, the homeowner may very well decide to take a new \nloan at a lower rate, using the proceeds to pay off the original loan. The right to prepay \nthe loan is, of course, precisely analogous to the right to refund a callable bond. The call \nprice for the mortgage is simply the remaining principal balance on the loan. Therefore, \nthe mortgage-backed security is best viewed as a portfolio of  callable   amortizing loans. \n Mortgage-backs are subject to the same negative convexity as other callable bonds. \nWhen rates fall and homeowners prepay their mortgages, the repayment of principal is \npassed through to the investors. Rather than enjoying capital gains on their investment, \nthey simply receive the outstanding principal balance on the loan. Therefore, the value of \nthe mortgage-backed security as a function of interest rates, presented in  Figure\u00a016.6 , looks \nmuch like the plot for a callable bond.  \n10 Actually, the financial institution that continues to service the loan and the pass-through agency that guarantees \nthe loan each retain a portion of the monthly payment as a charge for their services. Thus, the monthly payment \nreceived by the investor is a bit less than the amount paid by the borrower. \n Figure 16.6 Price-yield curve for a mortgage-backed security  \nBond Price\n0\nInterest RatePrincipal\nBalance\nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   531bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   531 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n532 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n There are some differences between the mortgage-backs and callable corporate bonds, \nhowever. For example, you will commonly find mortgage-backs selling for more than \ntheir principal balance. This is because homeowners do not refinance their loans as soon as interest rates drop. Some homeowners do not want to incur the costs or hassles of refi-nancing unless the benefit is great enough, others may decide not to refinance if they are planning to move shortly, and others may simply be unsophisticated in making the refi-nancing decision. Therefore, while the mortgage-backed security exhibits negative con-vexity at low rates, its implicit call price (the principal balance on the loan) is not a firm ceiling on its value. \n Simple mortgage-backs have also given rise to a rich set of mortgage-backed deriva-\ntives. For example, a CMO (collateralized mortgage obligation) further redirects the cash flow stream of the mortgage-backed security to several classes of derivative securities called \u201ctranches.\u201d These tranches may be designed to allocate interest rate risk to investors most willing to bear that risk.  \n11    \n The following table is an example of a very simple CMO structure. The underlying \nmortgage pool is divided into three tranches, each with a different effective maturity and therefore interest rate risk exposure. Suppose the original pool has $10 million of 15-year-maturity mortgages, each with an interest rate of 10.5%, and is subdivided into three tranches as follows:   \nTranche A 5 $4 million principal \u201cShort-pay\u201d tranche\nTranche B 5 $3 million principal \u201cIntermediate-pay\u201d tranche\nTranche C 5 $3 million principal \u201cLong-pay\u201d tranche\n Suppose further that in each year, 8% of outstanding loans in the pool prepay. Then total \ncash flows in each year to the whole mortgage pool are given in panel A of  Figure\u00a016.7 . Total payments shrink by 8% each year, as that percentage of the loans in the original pool is paid off. The light portions of each bar represent interest payments, while the dark portions are principal payments, including both loan amortization and prepayments.  \n In each period, each tranche receives the interest owed it based on the promised coupon \nrate and outstanding principal balance. But initially,  all  principal payments, both prepay-\nments and amortization, go to tranche A ( Figure\u00a016.7 , panel B). Notice from panels C and D that tranches B and C receive only interest payments until tranche A is retired. Once tranche A is fully paid off, all principal payments go to tranche B. Finally, when B is retired, all principal payments go to C. This makes tranche A a \u201cshort-pay\u201d class, with the lowest effective duration, while tranche C is the longest-pay tranche. This is therefore a relatively simple way to allocate interest rate risk among tranches. \n Many variations on the theme are possible and employed in practice. Different tranches \nmay receive different coupon rates. Some tranches may be given preferential treatment in terms of uncertainty over mortgage prepayment speeds. Complex formulas may be used to dictate the cash flows allocated to each tranche. In essence, the mortgage pool is treated as a source of cash flows that can be reallocated to different investors in accordance with the tastes of different investors.    \n11In Chapter 14, we examined how collateralized debt obligations or CDOs used tranche structures to reallocate \n credit risk  among different classes. Credit risk in agency-sponsored mortgage-backed securities is not really an \nissue because the mortgage payments are guaranteed by the agency, and for now, the federal government; in the CMO market, tranche structure is used to allocate  interest rate risk  rather than credit risk across classes.\nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   532bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   532 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 16 Managing Bond Portfolios 533\n Figure 16.7  Panel A:   cash flows to whole mortgage pool;  Panels B\u2013D:   cash flows to three tranches.  \n25,000\n20,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n0\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15\nPrincipal InterestA: Whole Mortgage\n20,00025,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n0\n13579 1 1 1 3 1 5\nPrincipal InterestB: Tranche A\nPrincipal Interest\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 1515,00020,00025,000\n10,000\n5,000\n0C: Tranche B\n15,00020,00025,000\n10,000\n5,000\n0\nPrincipal Interest13579 1 1 1 3 1 5D: Tranche C\nYear\n  Passive managers take bond prices as fairly set and seek to control only the risk of their \nfixed-income portfolio. Two broad classes of passive management are pursued in the fixed-\nincome market. The first is an indexing strategy that attempts to replicate the performance \nof a given bond index. The second broad class of passive strategies is known as immuniza-\ntion techniques; they are used widely by financial institutions such as insurance companies \nand pension funds, and are designed to shield the overall financial status of the institution \nfrom exposure to interest rate fluctuations.    16.3 Passive Bond Management \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   533bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   533 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n534 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n Although indexing and immunization strategies are alike in that they accept market \nprices as correctly set, they are very different in terms of risk exposure. A bond-index port-\nfolio will have the same risk\u2013reward profile as the bond market index to which it is tied. In contrast, immunization strategies seek to establish a virtually zero-risk profile, in which interest rate movements have no impact on the value of the firm. We discuss both types of strategies in this section.  \n   Bond-Index Funds \n In principle, bond market indexing is similar to stock market indexing. The idea is to create a portfolio that mirrors the composition of an index that measures the broad market. In the U.S. equity market, for example, the S&P 500 is the most commonly used index for stock-index funds, and these funds simply buy shares of each firm in the S&P 500 in proportion to the market value of outstanding equity. A similar strategy is used for bond-index funds, but as we shall see shortly, several modifications are required because of difficulties unique to the bond market and its indexes. \n Three major indexes of the broad bond market are the Barclays Capital U.S. (formerly \nLehman) Aggregate Bond Index, the Salomon Broad Investment Grade (BIG) Index (now run by Citigroup), and the Merrill Lynch Domestic Master index. All are market-value-weighted indexes of total returns. All three include government, corporate, mortgage-backed, and Yankee bonds in their universes. (Yankee bonds are dollar-denominated, SEC-registered bonds of foreign issuers sold in the United States.) \n The first problem that arises in the formation of an indexed bond portfolio arises from \nthe fact that these indexes include thousands of securities, making it quite difficult to pur-chase each security in the index in proportion to its market value. Moreover, many bonds are very thinly traded, meaning that identifying their owners and purchasing the securities at a fair market price can be difficult. \n Bond-index funds also face more difficult rebalancing problems than do stock-index \nfunds. Bonds are continually dropped from the index as their maturities fall below 1 year. Moreover, as new bonds are issued, they are added to the index. Therefore, in contrast to equity indexes, the securities used to compute bond indexes constantly change. As they do, the manager must update or rebalance the portfolio to ensure a close match between the composition of the portfolio and the bonds included in the index. The fact that bonds generate considerable interest income that must be reinvested further complicates the job of the index fund manager. \n In practice, it is infeasible to precisely replicate the broad bond indexes. Instead, a \nstratified sampling or  cellular  approach is often pursued.  Figure\u00a016.8  illustrates the idea \nbehind the cellular approach. First, the bond market is stratified into several subclasses.  Figure\u00a016.8  shows a simple two-way breakdown by maturity and issuer; in practice, how-ever, criteria such as the bond\u2019s coupon rate or the credit risk of the issuer also would be used to form cells. Bonds falling within each cell are then considered reasonably homo-geneous. Next, the percentages of the entire universe (i.e., the bonds included in the index that is to be matched) falling within each cell are computed and reported, as we have done for a few cells in  Figure\u00a016.8 . Finally, the portfolio manager establishes a bond portfolio with representation for each cell that matches the representation of that cell in the bond universe. In this way, the characteristics of the portfolio in terms of maturity, coupon rate, credit risk, industrial representation, and so on, will match the characteristics of the index, and the performance of the portfolio likewise should match the index.  \n Retail investors can buy mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the broad \nbond market. For example, Vanguard\u2019s Total Bond Market Index Fund and Barclays Aggregate Bond Fund iShare (ticker AGG) both track the Barclays Aggregate index.  \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   534bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   534 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 16 Managing Bond Portfolios 535\n  Immunization \n In contrast to indexing strategies, many institutions try to insulate their portfolios from \ninterest rate risk altogether. Generally, there are two ways of viewing this risk. Some insti-\ntutions, such as banks, are concerned with protecting current net worth or net market value \nagainst interest rate fluctuations. Other investors, such as pension funds, may face an \nobligation to make payments after a given number of years. These investors are more \nconcerned with protecting the future values of their portfolios. \n What is common to all investors, however, is interest rate risk. The net worth of the \nfirm or the ability to meet future obligations fluctuates with interest rates.    Immunization    \ntechniques refer to strategies used by such investors to shield their overall financial status \nfrom interest rate risk. \n Many banks and thrift institutions have a natural mismatch between asset and liability \nmaturity structures. Bank liabilities are primarily the deposits owed to customers, most \nof which are very short-term in nature and, consequently, of low duration. Bank assets by \ncontrast are composed largely of outstanding commercial and consumer loans or mort-\ngages. These assets are of longer duration, and their values are correspondingly more \nsensitive to interest rate fluctuations. When interest rates increase unexpectedly, banks \ncan suffer serious decreases in net worth\u2014their assets fall in value by more than their \nliabilities. \n Similarly, a pension fund may have a mismatch between the interest rate sensitivity of \nthe assets held in the fund and the present value of its liabilities\u2014the promise to make pay-\nments to retirees. The nearby box illustrates the dangers that pension funds face when they \nneglect to consider the interest rate exposure of  both  assets and liabilities. For example, in \nsome recent years pension funds lost ground despite the fact that they enjoyed excellent \ninvestment returns. As interest rates fell, the value of their liabilities grew even faster than \nthe value of their assets. The lesson is that funds should match the interest rate exposure \nof assets and liabilities so that the value of assets will track the value of liabilities whether \nrates rise or fall. In other words, the financial manager might want to  immunize   the fund \nagainst interest rate volatility.  \n Figure 16.8 Stratification of bonds into cells  \nTreasurySector\nTerm\nto MaturityAgency Mortgage-\nbackedIndustrial Finance Utility Yankee\n12.1%\n4.1%\n9.2%0.1%\n3.4%<1 year\n1\u22123 years\n3\u22125 years\n5\u22127 years\n7\u221210 years\n10\u221215 years\n15\u221230 years\n30+ years5.4%\nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   535bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   535 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n536 Pension funds are not alone in this concern. Any institution with a future fixed obliga-\ntion might consider immunization a reasonable risk management policy. Insurance compa-\nnies, for example, also pursue immunization strategies. In fact, the notion of immunization was introduced by F. M. Redington,  \n12   an actuary for a life insurance company. The idea is \nthat duration-matched assets and liabilities let the asset portfolio meet the firm\u2019s obliga-tions despite interest rate movements.  \n Consider, for example, an insurance company that issues a guaranteed investment \ncontract, or GIC, for $10,000. (Essentially, GICs are zero-coupon bonds issued by the insurance company to its customers. They are popular products for individuals\u2019 retirement-savings accounts.) If the GIC has a 5-year maturity and a guaranteed interest rate of 8%, the insurance company promises to pay $10,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1.08) \n5 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$14,693.28 in 5 years. \n Suppose that the insurance company chooses to fund its obligation with $10,000 of 8% \n annual  coupon bonds, selling at par value, with 6 years to maturity. As long as the market \ninterest rate stays at 8%, the company has fully funded the obligation, as the present value of the obligation exactly equals the value of the bonds. \n  Table\u00a016.4 , panel A shows that if interest rates remain at 8%, the accumulated funds from \nthe bond will grow to exactly the $14,693.28 obligation. Over the 5-year period, year-end coupon income of $800 is reinvested at the prevailing 8% market interest rate. At the end of the period, the bonds can be sold for $10,000; they still will sell at par value because the coupon rate still equals the market interest rate. Total income after 5 years from rein-vested coupons and the sale of the bond is precisely $14,693.28.  \n If interest rates change, however, two offsetting influences will affect the ability of the \nfund to grow to the targeted value of $14,693.28. If interest rates rise, the fund will suffer a capital loss, impairing its ability to satisfy the obligation. The bonds will be worth less in 5 years than if interest rates had remained at 8%. However, at a higher interest rate, rein-vested coupons will grow at a faster rate, offsetting the capital loss. In other words, fixed-income investors face two offsetting types of interest rate risk:  price risk  and  reinvestment \nrate risk.  Increases in interest rates cause capital losses but at the same time increase the rate at which reinvested income will grow. If the portfolio duration is chosen appropriately, \n  12 F. M. Redington, \u201cReview of the Principle of Life-Office Valuations,\u201d  Journal of the Institute of Actuaries  \n78 (1952).   Pension Funds Lost Ground Despite \nBroad Market Gains \n With the S&P 500 providing a 16% rate of return, 2012 was \na good year for the stock market, and this performance helped boost the balance sheets of U.S. pension funds. Yet despite the increase in the value of their assets, the total estimated pension deficit of 400 large U.S. companies  rose  \nby nearly $80 billion, and many of these firms entered 2013 needing to shore up their pension funds with billions of dollars of additional cash. Ford Motor Co. alone predicted that it would contribute $5 billion to its fund. *  \n How could this happen? Blame the decline in interest \nrates during the year that were in part the force behind \nthe stock market gains. As rates fell, the present value of pension obligations to retirees rose even faster than the value of the assets backing those promises. It turns out that the value of pension liabilities is more sensitive to interest rate changes than the value of the typical assets held in those funds. So even though falling rates tend to pump up asset returns, they pump up liabilities even more so. In other words, the duration of fund investments tends to be shorter than the duration of its obligations. This duration mismatch makes funds vulnerable to interest rate declines. \n Why don\u2019t funds better match asset and liability dura-\ntions? One reason is that fund managers are often evalu-\nated based on their performance relative to standard bond market indexes. Those indexes tend to have far shorter durations than pension fund liabilities. So to some extent, managers may be keeping their eyes on the wrong ball, one with the wrong interest rate sensitivity.  \n  *These estimates appear in Mike Ramsey and Vipal Monga, \u201cLow \nRates Force Companies to Pour Cash into Pensions,\u201d  The Wall Street Journal,  February 3, 2013.

When the portfolio duration is set equal to the \ninvestor\u2019s horizon date, the accumulated value of the investment fund at the horizon date \nwill be unaffected by interest rate fluctuations.  For a horizon equal to the portfolio\u2019s dura-\ntion, price risk and reinvestment risk are precisely offsetting.   \n In our example, the duration of the 6-year maturity bonds used to fund the GIC is \n5 years. Because the fully funded plan has equal duration for its assets and liabilities, \nthe insurance company should be immunized against interest rate fluctuations. To confirm \nthis, let\u2019s check that the bond can generate enough income to pay off the obligation in \n5 years regardless of interest rate movements. \n In  Table\u00a016.4 , panels B and C illustrate two possible interest rate scenarios: Rates either \nfall to 7%, or increase to 9%. In both cases, the annual coupon payments are reinvested at \nthe new interest rate, which is assumed to change before the first coupon payment, and the \nbond is sold in year 5 to help satisfy the obligation of the GIC. \n  Table\u00a016.4 , panel B shows that if interest rates fall to 7%, the total funds will accumulate \nto $14,694.05, providing a small surplus of $.77. If rates increase to 9% as in  Table\u00a016.4 , \npanel C, the fund accumulates to $14,696.02, providing a small surplus of $2.74. \nPayment \nNumberYears Remaining \nuntil ObligationAccumulated Value \nof Invested Payment\nA.

First, duration \nmatching balances the differ-\nence between the accumulated \nvalue of the coupon payments \n(reinvestment rate risk) and the \nsale value of the bond (price \nrisk). That is, when interest \nrates fall, the coupons grow \nless than in the base case, but \nthe higher value of the bond \noffsets this. When interest rates \nrise, the value of the bond falls, \nbut the coupons more than \nmake up for this loss because \nthey are reinvested at the higher \nrate.  Figure\u00a016.9  illustrates this \ncase. The solid curve traces the \naccumulated value of the bonds \nif interest rates remain at 8%. \nThe dashed curve shows that \nvalue if interest rates happen \nto increase. The initial impact \nis a capital loss, but this loss \neventually is offset by the now-\nfaster growth rate of reinvested \nfunds. At the 5-year horizon date, equal to the bond\u2019s duration, the two effects just \ncancel, leaving the company able to satisfy its obligation with the accumulated proceeds \nfrom the bond.  \n We can also analyze immunization in terms of present as opposed to future values. \nPanel A in  Table\u00a016.5  shows the initial balance sheet for the insurance company\u2019s GIC. \nBoth assets and the obligation have market values of $10,000, so the plan is just fully \nfunded.

Regardless of the interest rate change, \nthe plan remains fully funded, with the surplus in panels B and C in  Table\u00a016.5  just about zero. The duration-matching strategy has ensured that both assets and liabilities react equally to interest rate fluctuations.  \n  Figure\u00a016.10  is a graph of the present values of the bond and the single-payment obliga-\ntion as a function of the interest rate. At the current rate of 8%, the values are equal, and the obligation is fully funded by the bond. Moreover, the two present value curves are tangent at  y \u00a0 5 \u00a08%. As interest rates change, the change in value of both the asset and the obliga-\ntion is equal, so the obligation remains fully funded. For greater changes in the interest rate, however, the present value curves diverge. This reflects the fact that the fund actually shows a small surplus in  Table\u00a016.4  at market interest rates other than 8%.   \n If the obligation was immunized, why is there  any  surplus in the fund? The answer is \nconvexity.  Figure\u00a016.10  shows that the coupon bond has greater convexity than the obliga-tion it funds. Hence, when rates move substantially, the bond value exceeds the present value of the obligation by a noticeable amount. \n This example highlights the importance of    rebalancing    immunized portfolios. As inter-\nest rates and asset durations change, a manager must rebalance the portfolio to realign its duration with the duration of the obligation. Moreover, even if interest rates do not change, asset durations  will  change solely because of the passage of time. Recall from  Figure\u00a016.2  \nthat duration generally decreases less rapidly than does maturity. Thus, even if an obliga-tion is immunized at the outset, as time passes the durations of the asset and liability will fall at different rates. Without portfolio rebalancing, durations will become unmatched.  eXcel APPLICATIONS:    Holding-Period Immunization \n  T he Online Learning Center (  www.mhhe.com/bkm  ) \ncontains a spreadsheet that is useful in understanding \nthe concept of holding-period immunization.

Immunization managers still actively update \nand monitor their positions.  \n An insurance company must make a payment of $19,487 in 7 years. The market interest \nrate is 10%, so the present value of the obligation is $10,000. The company\u2019s portfolio \nmanager wishes to fund the obligation using 3-year zero-coupon bonds and perpetuities \npaying annual coupons. (We focus on zeros and perpetuities to keep the algebra simple.) \nHow can the manager immunize the obligation? \n Immunization requires that the duration of the portfolio of assets equal the duration \nof the liability. We can proceed in four steps:\n    1.  Calculate the duration of the liability.   In this case, the liability duration is simple \nto compute. It is a single-payment obligation with duration of 7 years.  \n   2.  Calculate the duration of the asset portfolio.   The portfolio duration is the \nweighted average of duration of each component asset, with weights \nproportional to the funds placed in each asset. The duration of the zero-\ncoupon bond is simply its maturity, 3 years. The duration of the perpetuity \nis 1.10/.10\u00a0 5 \u00a011 years. Therefore, if the fraction of the portfolio invested in  Example 16.4 Constructing an Immunized Portfolio \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   540bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   540 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 16 Managing Bond Portfolios 541\nthe zero is called  w  and the fraction invested in the perpetuity is (1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 w  ), the \nportfolio duration will be   \nAsset duration 5 w 3 3 years 1 (1 2 w ) 3 11 years   \n   3.  Find the asset mix that sets the duration of assets equal to the 7-year duration of \nliabilities.  This requires us to solve for  w  in the following equation:   \nw 3 3 years 1 (1 2 w ) 3 11 years 5 7 years  \n   This implies that  w \u00a0 5 \u00a0\u00bd. The manager should invest half the portfolio in the zero \nand half in the perpetuity. This will result in an asset duration of 7 years.  \n   4.  Fully fund the obligation.  Because the obligation has a present value of $10,000, and the fund will be invested equally in the zero and the perpetuity, the manager must purchase $5,000 of the zero-coupon bond and $5,000 of the perpetuity. (Note that the  face value  of the zero will be $5,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1.10) \n3 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$6,655.)    \n Even if a position is immunized, however, the portfolio manager still cannot rest. This \nis because of the need for rebalancing in response to changes in interest rates. Moreover, \neven if rates do not change, the passage of time also will affect duration and require rebal-ancing. Let us continue Example 16.4 and see how the portfolio manager can maintain an immunized position. \n \n Suppose that 1 year has passed, and the interest rate remains at 10%. The portfo-\nlio manager of Example 16.4 needs to reexamine her position. Is the position still fully funded? Is it still immunized? If not, what actions are required? \n First, examine funding. The present value of the obligation will have grown to \n$11,000, as it is 1 year closer to maturity. The manager\u2019s funds also have grown \nto $11,000: The zero-coupon bonds have increased in value from $5,000 to $5,500 with the passage of time, while the perpetuity has paid its annual $500 coupon and remains worth $5,000. Therefore, the obligation is still fully funded. \n The portfolio weights must be changed, however. The zero-coupon bond now will \nhave a duration of 2 years, while the perpetuity duration remains at 11 years. The obli-\ngation is now due in 6 years. The weights must now satisfy the equation   \nw 3 2 1 (1 2 w ) 3 11 5 6  \n which implies that w 5    \n5/9 . To rebalance the portfolio and maintain the duration match, \nthe manager now must invest a total of $11,000 3    5/9  5 $6,111.11 in the zero-coupon \nbond. This requires that the entire $500 coupon payment be invested in the zero, with \nan additional $111.11 of the perpetuity sold and invested in the zero-coupon bond.  Example 16.5 Rebalancing \n Of course, rebalancing of the portfolio entails transaction costs as assets are bought \nor sold, so one cannot rebalance continuously. In practice, an appropriate compromise \nmust be established between the desire for perfect immunization, which requires continual rebalancing, and the need to control trading costs, which dictates less frequent rebalancing.   \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   541bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   541 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n542 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n  Cash Flow Matching and Dedication \n The problems associated with immunization seem to have a simple solution. Why not sim-\nply buy a zero-coupon bond with face value equal to the projected cash outlay? If we follow the principle of    cash flow matching    we automatically immunize the portfolio from interest \nrate risk because the cash flow from the bond and the obligation exactly offset each other. \n Cash flow matching on a multiperiod basis is referred to as a    dedication strategy.      I n  \nthis case, the manager selects either zero-coupon or coupon bonds with total cash flows in each period that match a series of obligations. The advantage of dedication is that it is a once-and-for-all approach to eliminating interest rate risk. Once the cash flows are matched, there is no need for rebalancing. The dedicated portfolio provides the cash neces-sary to pay the firm\u2019s liabilities regardless of the eventual path of interest rates. \n Cash flow matching is not more widely pursued probably because of the constraints that \nit imposes on bond selection. Immunization or dedication strategies are appealing to firms that do not wish to bet on general movements in interest rates, but these firms may want to immunize using bonds that they perceive are undervalued. Cash flow matching, however, places so many more constraints on the bond selection process that it can be impossible to pursue a dedication strategy using only \u201cunderpriced\u201d bonds. Firms looking for under-priced bonds give up exact and easy dedication for the possibility of achieving superior returns from the bond portfolio. \n Sometimes, cash flow matching is simply not possible. To cash flow match for a pension \nfund that is obligated to pay out a perpetual flow of income to current and future retirees, the pension fund would need to purchase fixed-income securities with maturities ranging up to hundreds of years. Such securities do not exist, making exact dedication infeasible.    Look again at Example 16.5. What would be the immunizing weights in the second \nyear if the interest rate had fallen to 8%?  CONCEPT CHECK 16.6 \n How would an increase in trading costs affect the attractiveness of dedication \nversus immunization?  CONCEPT CHECK 16.7 \n  Other Problems with Conventional Immunization \n If you look back at the definition of duration in Equation 16.1, you note that it uses the \nbond\u2019s yield to maturity to calculate the weight applied to the time until each coupon payment. Given this definition and limitations on the proper use of yield to maturity, it is perhaps not surprising that this notion of duration is strictly valid only for a flat yield curve for which all payments are discounted at a common interest rate. \n If the yield curve is not flat, then the definition of duration must be modified and \nCF \n t   /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y )  t   replaced with the present value of CF  t  , where the present value of each cash \nflow is calculated by discounting with the appropriate spot interest rate from the zero-\ncoupon yield curve corresponding to the date of the  particular  cash flow, instead of by \ndiscounting with the  bond\u2019s  yield to maturity. Moreover, even with this modification, \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   542bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   542 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 16 Managing Bond Portfolios 543\nduration matching will immunize portfolios only for parallel shifts in the yield curve. \nClearly, this sort of restriction is unrealistic. As a result, much work has been devoted to \ngeneralizing the notion of duration. Multifactor duration models have been developed to allow for tilts and other distortions in the shape of the yield curve, in addition to shifts in its level. However, the added complexity of such models does not appear to pay off in terms of substantially greater effectiveness.  \n13    \n Finally, immunization can be an inappropriate goal in an inflationary environment. \nImmunization is essentially a nominal notion and makes sense only for nominal liabilities. It makes no sense to immunize a projected obligation that will grow with the price level using nominal assets such as bonds. For example, if your child will attend college in 15 years and if the annual cost of tuition is expected to be $50,000 at that time, immunizing your portfolio at a locked-in terminal value of $50,000 is not necessarily a risk-reducing strategy. The tuition obligation will vary with the realized inflation rate, whereas the asset portfolio\u2019s final value will not. In the end, the tuition obligation will not necessarily be matched by the value of the portfolio.    \n  13 G. O. Bierwag, G. C. Kaufman, and A. Toevs, eds.,  Innovations in Bond Portfolio Management: Duration \nAnalysis and Immunization  (Greenwich, CT: JAI Press, 1983).    Sources of Potential Profit \n Broadly speaking, there are two sources of potential value in active bond management. The first is interest rate forecasting, which tries to anticipate movements across the entire spec-trum of the fixed-income market. If interest rate declines are anticipated, managers will increase portfolio duration (and vice versa). The second source of potential profit is iden-tification of relative mispricing within the fixed-income market. An analyst, for example, might believe that the default premium on one particular bond is unnecessarily large and therefore that the bond is underpriced. \n These techniques will generate abnormal returns only if the analyst\u2019s information or \ninsight is superior to that of the market. You cannot profit from knowledge that rates are about to fall if prices already reflect this information. You know this from our discussion of market efficiency. Valuable information is differential information. In this context it is worth noting that interest rate forecasters have a notoriously poor track record. If you con-sider this record, you will approach attempts to time the bond market with caution. \n Homer and Liebowitz (see footnote 2) coined a popular taxonomy of active bond port-\nfolio strategies. They characterize portfolio rebalancing activities as one of four types of  bond swaps.  In the first two swaps the investor typically believes that the yield relation-\nship between bonds or sectors is only temporarily out of alignment. When the aberration is eliminated, gains can be realized on the underpriced bond. The period of realignment is called the  workout period. \n    1. The    substitution swap    is an exchange of one bond for a nearly identical substitute. \nThe substituted bonds should be of essentially equal coupon, maturity, quality, call features, sinking fund provisions, and so on. This swap would be motivated by a belief that the market has temporarily mispriced the two bonds, and that the dis-crepancy between the prices of the bonds represents a profit opportunity. \n An example of a substitution swap would be a sale of a 20-year maturity, \n6% coupon Toyota bond that is priced to provide a yield to maturity of 6.05%,    16.4 Active Bond Management \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   543bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   543 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\n544 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\ncoupled with a purchase of a 6% coupon Honda bond with the same time to \nmaturity that yields 6.15%. If the bonds have about the same credit rating, there is no apparent reason for the Honda bonds to provide a higher yield. Therefore, the higher yield actually available in the market makes the Honda bond seem relatively attractive. Of course, the equality of credit risk is an important condi-tion. If the Honda bond is in fact riskier, then its higher yield does not represent a bargain.  \n   2. The    intermarket spread swap    is pursued when an investor believes that the yield \nspread between two sectors of the bond market is temporarily out of line. For example, if the current spread between corporate and government bonds is consid-ered too wide and is expected to narrow, the investor will shift from government bonds into corporate bonds. If the yield spread does in fact narrow, corporates will outperform governments. For example, if the yield spread between 10-year Trea-sury bonds and 10-year Baa-rated corporate bonds is now 3%, and the historical spread has been only 2%, an investor might consider selling holdings of Treasury bonds and replacing them with corporates. If the yield spread eventually narrows, the Baa-rated corporate bonds will outperform the Treasuries. \n Of course, the investor must consider carefully whether there is a good reason \nthat the yield spread seems out of alignment. For example, the default premium on corporate bonds might have increased because the market is expecting a severe recession. In this case, the wider spread would not represent attractive pricing of corporates relative to Treasuries, but would simply be an adjustment for a perceived increase in credit risk.  \n   3. The    rate anticipation swap    is pegged to interest rate forecasting. In this case if \ninvestors believe that rates will fall, they will swap into bonds of longer duration. Conversely, when rates are expected to rise, they will swap into shorter dura-tion bonds. For example, the investor might sell a 5-year maturity Treasury bond, replacing it with a 25-year maturity Treasury bond. The new bond has the same lack of credit risk as the old one, but has longer duration.  \n   4. The    pure yield pickup swap    is pursued not in response to perceived mispricing, \nbut as a means of increasing return by holding higher-yield bonds. When the yield curve is upward-sloping, the yield pickup swap entails moving into longer-term bonds. This must be viewed as an attempt to earn an expected term premium in higher-yield bonds. The investor is willing to bear the interest rate risk that this strategy entails. The investor who swaps the shorter-term bond for the longer one will earn a higher rate of return as long as the yield curve does not shift up during the holding period. Of course if it does, the longer-duration bond will suffer a greater capital loss.    \n We can add a fifth swap, called a    tax swap,      to this list. This simply refers to a swap to \nexploit some tax advantage. For example, an investor may swap from one bond that has decreased in price to another if realization of capital losses is advantageous for tax purposes.  \n  Horizon Analysis \n One form of interest rate forecasting, which we encountered in Chapter 14, is called    horizon \nanalysis.      The analyst using this approach selects a particular holding period and predicts the yield curve at the end of that period. Given a bond\u2019s time to maturity at the end of the hold-ing period, its yield can be read from the predicted yield curve and its end-of-period price calculated. Then the analyst adds the coupon income and prospective capital gain of the bond to obtain the total return on the bond over the holding period.       \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   544bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   544 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 16 Managing Bond Portfolios 545\n A 20-year maturity bond with a 10% coupon rate (paid annually) currently sells at a yield \nto maturity of 9%. A portfolio manager with a 2-year horizon needs to forecast the total return on the bond over the coming 2 years. In 2 years, the bond will have an 18-year maturity. The analyst forecasts that 2 years from now, 18-year bonds will sell at yields to maturity of 8%, and that coupon payments can be reinvested in short-term securities over the coming 2 years at a rate of 7%. \n To calculate the 2-year return on the bond, the analyst would perform the following \ncalculations:\n    1.    Current price 5 $100 3 Annuity factor (9%, 20 years)\n1 $1,000 3 PV factor (9%, 20 years)\n5 $1,091.29   \n   2.    Forecast price 5 $100 3 Annuity factor (8%, 18 years)\n1 $1,000 3 PV factor (8%, 18 years)\n5 $1,187.44   \n   3. The future value of reinvested coupons will be ($100\u00a0 3 \u00a01.07)\u00a0 1 \u00a0$100\u00a0 5 \u00a0$207  \n   4. The 2-year return is   \n$207 1 ($1,187.44 2 $1,091.29)\n$1,091.29   5 0.278, or 27.8%    \n The annualized rate of return over the 2-year period would then be (1.278) 1/2 \u00a0 2 \u00a01\u00a0 5 \u00a00.13, \nor 13%.  Example 16.6 Horizon Analysis \n What will be the rate of return in Example 16.6 if the manager forecasts that in 2 years the yield on \n18-year bonds will be 10%, and that the reinvestment rate for coupons will be 8%?  CONCEPT CHECK 16.8 \n     1 .   Even default-free bonds such as Treasury issues are subject to interest rate risk. Longer-term bonds generally are more sensitive to interest rate shifts than are short-term bonds. A measure of the aver-age life of a bond is Macaulay\u2019s duration, defined as the weighted average of the times until each payment made by the security, with weights proportional to the present value of the payment.  \n    2 .   Duration is a direct measure of the sensitivity of a bond\u2019s price to a change in its yield. The pro-portional change in a bond\u2019s price equals the negative of duration multiplied by the proportional change in 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y.   \n    3 .   Convexity refers to the curvature of a bond\u2019s price-yield relationship. Accounting for convexity can substantially improve on the accuracy of the duration approximation for the response of bond prices to changes in yields.  \n    4 .   Immunization strategies are characteristic of passive fixed-income portfolio management. Such strategies attempt to render the individual or firm immune from movements in interest rates. This may take the form of immunizing net worth or, instead, immunizing the future accumulated value of a fixed-income portfolio.

Immunization of a fully funded plan is accomplished by matching the durations of assets \nand liabilities. To maintain an immunized position as time passes and interest rates change, the portfolio must be periodically rebalanced. Classic immunization also depends on parallel shifts in a flat yield curve. Given that this assumption is unrealistic, immunization generally will be less than complete. To mitigate the problem, multifactor duration models can be used to allow for variation in the shape of the yield curve.  \n    6 .   A more direct form of immunization is dedication, or cash flow matching. If a portfolio is per-fectly matched in cash flow with projected liabilities, rebalancing will be unnecessary.  \n    7 .   Active bond management consists of interest rate forecasting techniques and intermarket spread analysis. One popular taxonomy classifies active strategies as substitution swaps, intermarket spread swaps, rate anticipation swaps, and pure yield pickup swaps.  \n    8 .   Horizon analysis is a type of interest rate forecasting. In this procedure the analyst forecasts the position of the yield curve at the end of some holding period, and from that yield curve predicts corresponding bond prices. Bonds then can be ranked according to expected total returns (coupon plus capital gain) over the holding period.

A member \nof the Investment Committee, Fred Spice, is very interested in learning about the management of fixed-income portfolios. Spice has approached Meyers with several questions. Specifically, Spice would like to know how fixed-income managers position portfolios to capitalize on their expectations of future interest rates. \n Meyers decides to illustrate fixed-income trading strategies to Spice using a fixed-rate bond \nand note. Both bonds have semiannual coupon periods. Unless otherwise stated all interest rate changes are parallel. The characteristics of these securities are shown in the following table. He also considers a 9-year floating-rate bond (floater) that pays a floating rate semiannually and is currently yielding 5%.   \nCharacteristics of Fixed-Rate Bond and Fixed-Rate Note\nFixed-Rate Bond Fixed-Rate Note\nPrice 107.18 100.00\nYield to maturity 5.00% 5.00%\nPeriod to maturity 18 8\nModified duration 6.9848 3.5851\n Spice asks Meyers about how a fixed-income manager would position his portfolio to capitalize on expectations of increasing interest rates. Which of the following would be the most appropri-ate strategy?\n     a.  Shorten his portfolio duration.  \n    b.  Buy fixed-rate bonds.  \n    c.  Lengthen his portfolio duration.     \n   18. Spice asks Meyers (see previous problem) to quantify price changes from changes in inter-\nest rates. To illustrate, Meyers computes the value change for the fixed-rate note in the table. Specifically, he assumes an increase in the level of interest rate of 100 basis points. Using the information in the table, what is the predicted change in the price of the fixed-rate note?  \n   19. A 30-year maturity bond has a 7% coupon rate, paid annually. It sells today for $867.42. A \n20-year maturity bond has 6.5% coupon rate, also paid annually. It sells today for $879.50. A bond market analyst forecasts that in 5 years, 25-year maturity bonds will sell at yields to maturity of 8% and 15-year maturity bonds will sell at yields of 7.5%. Because the yield curve is upward sloping, the analyst believes that coupons will be invested in short-term securities at a rate of 6%.

All securities in the bond portfolio are \nnoncallable U.S. Treasury securities.  \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   550bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   550 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 16 Managing Bond Portfolios 551\nPrice If Yields \nChange\nPar Value \n(U.S. $)Treasury \nSecurityMarket \nValue \n(U.S. $)Current \nPriceUp 100 \nBasis \nPointsDown \n100 Basis \nPointsEffective \nDuration\n48,000,000 2.375% due 2011 48,667,680 101.391 99.245 103.595 2.15\n50,000,000 4.75% due 2036 50,000,000 100.000 86.372 116.887 \u201498,000,000 Total Bond Portfolio 98,667,680 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n     a.  Calculate the effective duration of each of the following:\n    i. The 4.75% Treasury security due 2036.  \n   ii. The total bond portfolio.     \n    b.  VanHusen remarks to Kapple, \u201cIf you changed the maturity structure of the bond portfolio to \nresult in a portfolio duration of 5.25 years, the price sensitivity of the portfolio would be iden-tical to that of a single, noncallable Treasury security that also has a duration of 5.25 years.\u201d In what circumstance would VanHusen\u2019s remark be correct?     \n   6. One common goal among fixed-income portfolio managers is to earn high incremental returns on \ncorporate bonds versus government bonds of comparable durations. The approach of some corporate-bond portfolio managers is to find and purchase those corporate bonds having the largest initial spreads over comparable-duration government bonds. John Ames, HFS\u2019s fixed-income manager, believes that a more rigorous approach is required if incremental returns are to be maximized. \n The following table presents data relating to one set of corporate/government spread relation-\nships present in the market at a given date:\nBond RatingInitial Spread over \nGovernmentsExpected \nHorizon Spread Initial DurationExpected Duration \n1 Year from Now\nAaa 31 b.p. 31 b.p. 4 years 3.1 years\nAa 40 b.p. 50 b.p. 4 years 3.1 years\nNote: 1 b.p. means 1 basis point, or .01%.\n     a.  Recommend purchase of either Aaa or Aa bonds for a 1-year investment horizon given a goal \nof maximizing incremental returns.  \n    b.  Ames chooses not to rely  solely  on initial spread relationships. His analytical framework con-\nsiders a full range of other key variables likely to impact realized incremental returns, including call provisions and potential changes in interest rates. Describe variables, in addition to those identified above, that Ames should include in his analysis and explain how each of these could cause realized incremental returns to differ from those indicated by initial spread relationships.     \n   7. Patrick Wall is considering the purchase of one of the two bonds described in the following table. \nWall realizes his decision will depend primarily on effective duration, and he believes that interest rates will decline by 50 basis points at all maturities over the next 6 months.  \nCharacteristic CIC PTR\nMarket price 101.75 101.75\nMaturity date June 1, 2022 June 1, 2022\nCall date Noncallable June 1, 2017\nAnnual coupon 5.25% 6.35%\nInterest payment Semiannual Semiannual\nEffective duration 7.35 5.40\nYield to maturity 5.02% 6.10%\nCredit rating A A\nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   551bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   551 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm552 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n     a.  Calculate the percentage price change forecasted by effective duration for both the CIC and \nPTR bonds if interest rates decline by 50 basis points over the next 6 months.  \n    b.  Calculate the 6-month horizon return (in percent) for each bond, if the actual CIC bond price \nequals 105.55 and the actual PTR bond price equals 104.15 at the end of 6 months.  \n    c.  Wall is surprised by the fact that although interest rates fell by 50 basis points, the actual price \nchange for the CIC bond was greater than the price change forecasted by effective duration, \nwhereas the actual price change for the PTR bond was less than the price change forecasted by effective duration. Explain why the actual price change would be greater for the CIC bond and the actual price change would be less for the PTR bond.     \n   8. You are the manager for the bond portfolio of a pension fund. The policies of the fund allow for \nthe use of active strategies in managing the bond portfolio. \n It appears that the economic cycle is beginning to mature, inflation is expected to acceler-\nate, and in an effort to contain the economic expansion, central bank policy is moving toward constraint. For each of the situations below, state which one of the two bonds you would prefer. Briefly justify your answer in each case.\n     a.  Government of Canada (Canadian pay) 4% due in 2017 and priced at 98.75 to yield 4.50% to \nmaturity. \n or \n   Government of Canada (Canadian pay) 4% due in 2027 and priced at 91.75 to yield 5.19% to \nmaturity.  \n    b.

A member of a firm\u2019s investment committee is very interested in learning about the management \nof fixed-income portfolios. He would like to know how fixed-income managers position portfo-lios to capitalize on their expectations concerning three factors which influence interest rates:\n     a.  Changes in the level of interest rates.  \n    b.  Changes in yield spreads across/between sectors.  \n    c.  Changes in yield spreads as to a particular instrument. \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   552bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   552 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 16 Managing Bond Portfolios 553\n   Formulate and describe a fixed-income portfolio management strategy for each of these factors \nthat could be used to exploit a portfolio manager\u2019s expectations about that factor. ( Note:  Three \nstrategies are required, one for each of the listed factors.)     \n   10. Carol Harrod is the investment officer for a $100 million U.S. pension fund. The fixed-\nincome portion of the portfolio is actively managed, and a substantial portion of the \nfund\u2019s large capitalization U.S. equity portfolio is indexed and managed by Webb Street Advisors. \n Harrod has been impressed with the investment results of Webb Street\u2019s equity index strat-\negy and is considering asking Webb Street to index a portion of the actively managed fixed-income portfolio.\n     a.  Describe advantages and disadvantages of bond indexing relative to active bond \nmanagement.  \n    b.  Webb Street manages indexed bond portfolios. Discuss how an indexed bond portfolio is \nconstructed under stratified sampling (cellular) methods.  \n    c.  Describe the main source of tracking error for the cellular method.     \n   11. Janet Meer is a fixed-income portfolio manager. Noting that the current shape of the yield curve \nis flat, she considers the purchase of a newly issued, 7% coupon, 10-year maturity, option-free \ncorporate bond priced at par. The bond has the following features:  \nChange in Yields\nUp 10 Basis Points Down 10 Basis Points\nPrice 99.29 100.71\nConvexity measure 35.00\nConvexity adjustment       0.0035\n     a.  Calculate the modified duration of the bond.      b.  Meer is also considering the purchase of a newly issued, 7.25% coupon, 12-year maturity \noption-free corporate bond. She wants to evaluate this second bond\u2019s price sensitivity to an instantaneous, downward parallel shift in the yield curve of 200 basis points. Based on the following data, what will be its price change in this yield-curve scenario?    \nOriginal issue price Par value, to yield 7.25%\nModified duration (at original price) 7.90\nConvexity measure 41.55\nConvexity adjustment (yield change of 200 basis points) 1.66\n    c.  Meer asks her assistant to analyze several callable bonds, given the expected downward \nparallel shift in the yield curve. Meer\u2019s assistant argues that if interest rates fall enough, convexity for a callable bond will become negative. Is the assistant\u2019s argument correct?     \n   12. Noah Kramer, a fixed-income portfolio manager based in the country of Sevista, is consider-\ning the purchase of a Sevista government bond. Kramer decides to evaluate two strategies for implementing his investment in Sevista bonds.  Table 16A  gives the details of the two strategies, and  Table 16B  contains the assumptions that apply to both strategies.   \n Before choosing one of the two bond-investment strategies, Kramer wants to analyze \nhow the market value of the bonds will change if an instantaneous interest rate shift occurs immediately after his investment. The details of the interest rate shift are shown in  Table 16C . Calculate, for the instantaneous interest rate shift shown in  Table 16C , the percent change in the market value of the bonds that will occur under each strategy.   \nbod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   553bod61671_ch16_515-556.indd   553 7/17/13   4:05 PM7/17/13   4:05 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm554 PART IV  Fixed-Income Securities\n   13.

In accord with the duration rules presented in the chapter, you should find that duration is shorter \nwhen the coupon rate or yield to maturity is higher. Duration increases with maturity for most \nbonds. Duration is shorter when coupons are paid semiannually rather than annually because on average, payments come earlier. Instead of waiting until year-end to receive the annual coupon, investors receive half the coupon midyear.  \n   5. Macaulay\u2019s duration is defined as the weighted average of the time until receipt of each bond \npayment. Modified duration is defined as Macaulay\u2019s duration divided by 1\u00a0  1 \u00a0 y  (where  y  is \nyield per payment period, e.g., a semiannual yield if the bond pays semiannual coupons).

Effective duration captures this last property of modified duration. It is  defined  as percentage change in bond price per change in market interest rates. \nEffective duration for a bond with embedded options requires a valuation method that allows for such options in computing price changes. Effective duration cannot be related to a weighted average of times until payments, because those payments are themselves uncertain.  \n   6. The perpetuity\u2019s duration now would be 1.08/.08\u00a0 5 \u00a013.5.

This is the heart of   fundamental analysis   \u2014that is, the analysis of \nthe determinants of value such as earnings \nprospects. Ultimately, the business success of the firm determines the dividends it can pay to shareholders and the price it will command in the stock market. Because the prospects of the firm are tied to those of the broader economy, however, fundamental analysis must consider the business environment in which the firm operates. For some firms, macroeconomic and industry circumstances might have a greater influence on profits than the firm\u2019s relative performance within its industry. In other words, investors need to keep the big economic picture in mind. \n Therefore, in analyzing a firm\u2019s prospects \nit often makes sense to start with the broad \neconomic environment, examining the state of the aggregate economy and even the  international economy. From there, one con-\nsiders the implications of the outside envi-ronment on the industry in which the firm operates. Finally, the firm\u2019s position within the industry is examined. \n This chapter treats the broad-based aspects \nof fundamental analysis\u2014macroeconomic \nand industry analysis. The two chapters fol-lowing cover firm-specific analysis. We begin with a discussion of international factors relevant to firm performance, and move on to an overview of the significance of the key variables usually used to summarize the state of the macroeconomy. We then discuss gov-ernment macroeconomic policy. We conclude the analysis of the macroenvironment with a discussion of business cycles. Finally, we move to industry analysis, treating issues concern-ing the sensitivity of the firm to the business cycle, the typical life cycle of an industry, and strategic issues that affect industry performance.

Table 17.1 \n Economic \nperformance   A top-down analysis of a firm\u2019s prospects must start with the global economy. The interna-\ntional economy might affect a firm\u2019s export prospects, the price competition it faces from \ncompetitors, or the profits it makes on investments abroad.  Table\u00a017.1  shows the impor-\ntance of the global or broad regional macroeconomy to firms\u2019 prospects.    Much of Europe \nat this time was still mired in the euro zone crisis and was expected to show anemic or even \nnegative growth. In contrast, other broad regions, such as Asia, were expected to exhibit \nvery healthy growth rates. The so-called BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, \nand South Africa), often grouped together because of their rapid recent development, were \nby and large expected to continue that performance .\n In addition to the variation in regional macroeconomic conditions, economic perfor-\nmance varies considerably across countries even within regions. In Europe, the Greek \neconomy was expected to continue its painful contraction, with a forecast decline in GDP \nof 5.0% in 2013, while Germany was expected to show positive, albeit modest, growth. \n Perhaps surprisingly, the best stock market returns did not align with the best macro-\neconomic expectations. This reflects the impact of near market efficiency. China\u2019s growth \nwas the highest in the  Table\u00a017.1  sample, but at the start of the year its growth already was \nexpected to be high. With actual growth actually a bit lower than prior expectations, stock \nmarket performance was lackluster. In contrast, German growth was tepid, but its stock \nmarket shined as its risks from the euro zone difficulties seemed to subside. \n These data illustrate that the national economic environment can be a crucial determi-\nnant of industry performance. It is far harder for businesses to succeed in a contracting \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   558bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   558 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\n559economy than in an expanding one. This observation highlights the role of a big-picture \nmacroeconomic analysis as a fundamental part of the investment process. \n In addition, the global environment presents political risks of considerable magnitude. \nThe euro crisis offers a compelling illustration of the interplay between politics and eco-nomics. The prospects of a bailout for Greece, as well as support for struggling but much larger economies such as Spain, have been in large part political issues but with enormous consequences for the world economy. Similarly, the 2012 debate over the so-called fiscal cliff in the United States was the stage for pitched political battles with huge economic consequences. The ongoing political battle over government budget deficits and how to address them is of tremendous import for the economy. At this level of analysis, it is clear that politics and economics are intimately entwined. \n Other political issues that are less sensational but still extremely important to economic \ngrowth and investment returns include issues of protectionism and trade policy, the free flow of capital, and the status of a nation\u2019s workforce. \n One obvious factor that affects the international competitiveness of a country\u2019s indus-\ntries is the exchange rate between that country\u2019s currency and other currencies. The    exchange rate    is the rate at which domestic currency can be converted into foreign cur-\nrency. For example, in early 2013, it took about 88 Japanese yen to purchase 1 U.S. dollar. We would say that the exchange rate is \u00a588 per dollar or, equivalently, $.0144 per yen. \n As exchange rates fluctuate, the dollar value of goods priced in foreign currency simi-\nlarly fluctuates. For example, in 1980, the dollar\u2013yen exchange rate was about $.0045 per yen. Because the exchange rate in 2013 was $.0114 per yen, a U.S. citizen would need 2.5 times as many dollars in 2013 to buy a product selling for \u00a510,000 as would have been required in 1980. If the Japanese producer were to maintain a fixed yen price for its product, the price expressed in U.S. dollars would more than double. This would make Japanese products more expensive to U.S. consumers, however, and result in lost sales. Obviously, appreciation of the yen creates a problem for Japanese producers that must compete with U.S. producers. \n The nearby box discusses Honda\u2019s response to the dramatic increase in the value of \nthe yen. It is moving a good part of its manufacturing operations to North America to take advantage of the reduced cost of production (as measured in yen) in the U.S. and Mexico.   Honda Revs Up Outside Japan \n Honda Motor Co. plans to shift a major chunk of its \nmanufacturing to North America over the next two years, bulking up production capacity in the region by as much as 40% to combat a strengthening yen that has made Japanese cars too expensive to export around the world. \n The drive to bulk up in North America is led by the yen\u2019s \nstrength against the U.S. dollar, a change that is causing \nHonda and other Japanese auto makers to lose money on many of the vehicles they now export from Japan. A stron-ger yen erodes the value of dollar-denominated profit and makes exports less price competitive. \n Honda, which produced 1.29 million vehicles in North \nAmerica in 2010, plans to build a new plant in Celaya, \nMexico, and expand all seven of its existing assembly plants, aiming to build just short of 2 million cars and trucks a year, Tetsuo Iwamura, president of American Honda, the company\u2019s North American arm, said in an interview with  The Wall Street Journal.    The strategic shift is \u201cdirectly linked to the yen,\u201d \nMr. Iwamura said. \u201cIt is virtually impossible to make \nmoney [on exporting vehicles from Japan] in the short and medium term.\u201d \n Honda\u2019s shift is indicative of the broad impact the yen is \nhaving on Japanese auto makers facing a currency that has \nstrengthened by nearly 40% in the last four years. The yen was trading at 77.89 to the dollar Tuesday and as recently as 2007 was at 120 to the dollar. \n The dramatic strengthening of the yen makes it par-\nticularly hard to make money on small cars because profit \nmargins are already thin. To help reduce the number of Fits that Honda exports from Japan, the company recently began shipping Fit cars from China to Canadian dealers as a stopgap measure.  \n  Source:  Mike Ramsey and Neal Boudette, \u201cHonda Revs Up Plants \nin America,\u201d  The Wall Street Journal,  Dec. 21, 2011.

Thus the first step in forecasting the performance \nof the broad market is to assess the status of the economy as a whole.  \n The ability to forecast the macroeconomy can translate into spectacular investment per-\nformance. But it is not enough to forecast the macroeconomy well. You must forecast it \nbetter   than your competitors to earn abnormal profits. In this section, we will review some \nof the key economic statistics used to describe the state of the macroeconomy.         \n  Gross Domestic Product     Gross domestic product  ,   or    GDP  ,   is the measure of the econo-\nmy\u2019s total production of goods and services. Rapidly growing GDP indicates an expanding \neconomy with ample opportunity for a firm to increase sales. Another popular measure of \nthe economy\u2019s output is  industrial production.   This statistic provides a measure of eco-\nnomic activity more narrowly focused on the manufacturing side of the economy.  \n  Employment   The    unemployment rate    is the percentage of the total labor force (i.e., \nthose who are either working or actively seeking employment) yet to find work. The unem-\nployment rate measures the extent to which the economy is operating at full capacity. The \nunemployment rate is a factor related to workers only, but further insight into the strength \nof the economy can be gleaned from the unemployment rate for other factors of produc-\ntion. Analysts also look at the factory  capacity utilization rate,   which is the ratio of actual \noutput from factories to potential output.  \n  Inflation   The rate at which the general level of prices rise is called    inflation  .   High rates \nof inflation often are associated with \u201coverheated\u201d economies, that is, economies where \nthe demand for goods and services is outstripping productive capacity, which leads to \nupward pressure on prices. Most governments walk a fine line in their economic policies. \n Figure 17.2 S&P 500 Index versus earnings per share  \n Source: Authors\u2019 calculations using data from  The Economic Report of the President .  \n05001,0001,5002,0002,500\n1955\n1959\n1963\n1967\n1971\n1975\n1979\n1983\n1987\n1991\n1995\n1999\n2003\n2007\n201112 x EPS18 x EPS25 x EPS \nS&P 500\nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   561bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   561 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\n562 PART V  Security Analysis\nThey hope to stimulate their economies enough to maintain nearly full employment, but \nnot so much as to bring on inflationary pressures. The perceived trade-off between infla-tion and unemployment is at the heart of many macroeconomic policy disputes. There is considerable room for disagreement as to the relative costs of these policies as well as the economy\u2019s relative vulnerability to these pressures at any particular time.  \n  Interest Rates   High interest rates reduce the present value of future cash flows, thereby \nreducing the attractiveness of investment opportunities. For this reason, real interest \nrates are key determinants of business investment expenditures. Demand for housing and high-priced consumer durables such as automobiles, which are commonly financed, also is highly sensitive to interest rates because interest rates affect interest payments. (In Chapter\u00a05, Section\u00a05.1, we examined the determinants of interest rates.)  \n  Budget Deficit   The    budget deficit    of the federal government is the difference between \ngovernment spending and revenues. Any budgetary shortfall must be offset by government \nborrowing. Large amounts of government borrowing can force up interest rates by increas-ing the total demand for credit in the economy. Economists generally believe excessive government borrowing will \u201ccrowd out\u201d private borrowing and investing by forcing up interest rates and choking off business investment.  \n  Sentiment   Consumers\u2019 and producers\u2019 optimism or pessimism concerning the economy \nis an important determinant of economic performance. If consumers have confidence in their future income levels, for example, they will be more willing to spend on big-ticket items. Similarly, businesses will increase production and inventory levels if they anticipate higher demand for their products. In this way, beliefs influence how much consumption and investment will be pursued and affect the aggregate demand for goods and services.       \n Consider an economy where the dominant industry is automobile production for domestic consumption \nas well as export. Now suppose the auto market is hurt by an increase in the length of time people use their cars before replacing them. Describe the probable effects of this change on ( a ) GDP, ( b ) unemploy-\nment, ( c ) the government budget deficit, and ( d ) interest rates.  CONCEPT CHECK 17.1 \n   17.3 Demand and Supply Shocks \n  A useful way to organize your analysis of the factors that might influence the macro-\neconomy is to classify any impact as a supply or demand shock. A    demand shock    is an \nevent that affects the demand for goods and services in the economy. Examples of positive demand shocks are reductions in tax rates, increases in the money supply, increases in government spending, or increases in foreign export demand. A    supply shock    is an event \nthat influences production capacity and costs. Examples of supply shocks are changes in the price of imported oil; freezes, floods, or droughts that might destroy large quantities of agricultural crops; changes in the educational level of an economy\u2019s workforce; or changes in the wage rates at which the labor force is willing to work. \n Demand shocks are usually characterized by aggregate output moving in the same direc-\ntion as interest rates and inflation. For example, a big increase in government spending will \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   562bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   562 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 17 Macroeconomic and Industry Analysis 563\ntend to stimulate the economy and increase GDP. It also might increase interest rates by \nincreasing the demand for borrowed funds by the government as well as by businesses that might desire to borrow to finance new ventures. Finally, it could increase the inflation rate if the demand for goods and services is raised to a level at or beyond the total productive capacity of the economy. \n Supply shocks are usually characterized by aggregate output moving in the opposite \ndirection of inflation and interest rates. For example, a big increase in the price of imported oil will be inflationary because costs of production will rise, which eventually will lead to increases in prices of finished goods. The increase in inflation rates over the near term can lead to higher nominal interest rates. Against this background, aggregate output will be falling. With raw materials more expensive, the productive capacity of the economy is reduced, as is the ability of individuals to purchase goods at now-higher prices. GDP, therefore, tends to fall. \n How can we relate this framework to investment analysis? You want to identify the \nindustries that will be most helped or hurt in any macroeconomic scenario you envision. For example, if you forecast a tightening of the money supply, you might want to avoid industries such as automobile producers that might be hurt by the likely increase in interest rates. We caution you again that these forecasts are no easy task. Macroeconomic predic-tions are notoriously unreliable. And again, you must be aware that in all likelihood your forecast will be made using only publicly available information. Any investment advantage you have will be a result only of better analysis\u2014not better information.   \n   17.4 Federal Government Policy \n  As the previous section would suggest, the government has two broad classes of macro-economic tools\u2014those that affect the demand for goods and services and those that affect the supply. For much of postwar history, demand-side policy was of primary interest. The focus was on government spending, tax levels, and monetary policy. Since the 1980s, how-ever, increasing attention has been focused on supply-side economics. Broadly interpreted, supply-side concerns have to do with enhancing the productive capacity of the economy, rather than increasing the demand for the goods and services the economy can produce. In practice, supply-side economists have focused on the appropriateness of the incentives to work, innovate, and take risks that result from our system of taxation. However, issues such as national policies on education, infrastructure (such as communication and trans-portation systems), and research and development also are properly regarded as part of supply-side macroeconomic policy.  \n   Fiscal Policy \n    Fiscal policy    refers to the government\u2019s spending and tax actions and is part of \u201cdemand-side management.\u201d Fiscal policy is probably the most direct way either to stimulate or to slow the economy. Decreases in government spending directly deflate the demand for goods and services. Similarly, increases in tax rates immediately siphon income from con-sumers and result in fairly rapid decreases in consumption. \n Ironically, although fiscal policy has the most immediate impact on the economy, the \nformulation and implementation of such policy is usually painfully slow and involved. This is because fiscal policy requires enormous amounts of compromise between the exec-utive and legislative branches. Tax and spending policy must be initiated and voted on by Congress, which requires considerable political negotiations, and any legislation passed \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   563bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   563 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\n564must be signed by the president, requiring more negotiation. Thus, although the impact of \nfiscal policy is relatively immediate, its formulation is so cumbersome that fiscal policy cannot in practice be used to fine-tune the economy. \n Moreover, much of government spending, such as that for Medicare or Social Security, \nis nondiscretionary, meaning that it is determined by formula rather than policy and cannot be changed in response to economic conditions. This places even more rigidity into the formulation of fiscal policy. \n A common way to summarize the net impact of government fiscal policy is to look at the \ngovernment\u2019s budget deficit or surplus, which is simply the difference between revenues and expenditures. A large deficit means the government is spending considerably more than it is taking in by way of taxes. The net effect is to increase the demand for goods (via spending) by more than it reduces the demand for goods (via taxes), thereby stimulating the economy. \n The debate over proper fiscal policy has become increasingly bitter in recent years. The \nnearby box summarizes the fiscal cliff impasse of 2012.   \n  Monetary Policy \n    Monetary policy    refers to the manipulation of the money supply to affect the macro-economy and is the other main leg of demand-side policy. Monetary policy works largely through its impact on interest rates. Increases in the money supply lower short-term interest rates, ultimately encouraging investment and consumption demand. Over longer periods, however, most economists believe a higher money supply leads only to a higher price level and does not have a permanent effect on economic activity. Thus the monetary authorities face a difficult balancing act. Expansionary monetary policy probably will lower interest rates and thereby stimulate investment and some consumption demand in the short run, but these circumstances ultimately will lead only to higher prices. The stimulation/inflation trade-off is implicit in all debate over proper monetary policy. \n Fiscal policy is cumbersome to implement but has a fairly direct impact on the econ-\nomy, whereas monetary policy is easily formulated and implemented but has a less imme-diate impact. Monetary policy is determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal   Fiscal Policy and the Fiscal Cliff \n The so-called fiscal cliff crisis at the end of 2012 came close \nto being an unintended experiment in extreme fiscal pol-icy. The seed of the crisis was planted in August 2011 when Congress, until then unable to agree on an expansion of the federal debt ceiling, passed an interim compromise. The debt ceiling would be allowed to rise, but with the pro-vision that Congress would, by the end of 2012, pass legis-lation reducing the federal budget deficit by $1.2 trillion over 10 years. A bipartisan \u201csuper-committee\u201d would be formed to propose a package of tax increases and spend-ing reductions. If no agreement were reached, 2013 tax rates would automatically revert to the higher levels pre-vailing during the Clinton presidency, and  across-the-board \nannual spending cuts or \u201csequestrations\u201d of about $110 billion would be split equally between domestic and defense programs. \n This compromise was intended to create a sword of \nDamocles to hang over Congress\u2019s head, ensuring that it \nwould be forced to arrive at a legislative compromise. If not, then the resulting contractionary fiscal policy, entailing both steep spending cuts and dramatic tax increases, was widely regarded as sure to lead to another recession. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the threatened tax increases and spending reductions would act to reduce GDP growth in 2013 from around 1.7% to  2 0.5% and \nincrease the unemployment rate by more than a percentage \npoint. This was the fiscal cliff Congress risked jumping from. \n In the end, Congress narrowly avoided jumping by \nenacting yet another stop-gap compromise. It delayed \nsequestration by two months, allowing budgetary negotia-tions to continue, and it paid for the cost of that delay by raising some tax rates, including those on capital gains and household income above $450,000. \n But the fiscal fight is far from over. The tax increases \nagreed to at the end of 2012 were far from enough to \nmeet the original target of a $1.2 trillion reduction in the 10-year deficit. Spending cut discussions are still con-tentious. And the government will bump up against the new debt ceiling in early 2013. The fiscal debate continues unabated.

Board members are appointed by the president for 14-year terms and \nare reasonably insulated from political pressure. The board is small enough, and often sufficiently dominated by its chairperson, that policy can be formulated and modulated relatively easily. \n Implementation of monetary policy also is quite direct. The most widely used tool is \nthe open market operation, in which the Fed buys or sells bonds for its own account. When the Fed buys securities, it simply \u201cwrites a check,\u201d thereby increasing the money supply. (Unlike us, the Fed can pay for the securities without drawing down funds at a bank account.) Conversely, when the Fed sells a security, the money paid for it leaves the money supply. Open market operations occur daily, allowing the Fed to fine-tune its monetary policy. \n Other tools at the Fed\u2019s disposal are the discount rate, which is the interest rate it charges \nbanks on short-term loans, and the reserve requirement, which is the fraction of deposits that banks must hold as cash on hand or as deposits with the Fed. Reductions in the dis-count rate signal a more expansionary monetary policy. Lowering reserve requirements allows banks to make more loans with each dollar of deposits and stimulates the economy by increasing the effective money supply. \n While the discount rate is under the direct control of the Fed, it is changed relatively \ninfrequently. The  federal funds rate  is by far the better guide to Federal Reserve policy. The \nfederal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks make short-term,  usually overnight, loans to each other. These loans occur because some banks need to borrow funds to meet reserve requirements, while other banks have excess funds. Unlike the discount rate, the fed funds rate is a market rate, meaning that it is determined by supply and demand rather than being set administratively. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve Board targets the fed funds rate, expanding or contracting the money supply through open market operations as it nudges the fed funds rate to its targeted value. This is the benchmark short-term U.S. interest rate, and as such it has considerable influence on other interest rates in the United States and the rest of the world. \n Monetary policy affects the economy in a more roundabout way than fiscal policy. \nWhereas fiscal policy directly stimulates or dampens the economy, monetary policy works largely through its impact on interest rates. Increases in the money supply lower interest rates, which stimulates investment demand. As the quantity of money in the economy increases, investors will find that their portfolios of assets include too much money. They will rebalance their portfolios by buying securities such as bonds, forcing bond prices up and interest rates down. In the longer run, individuals may increase their holdings of stocks as well and ultimately buy real assets, which stimulates consumption demand directly. The ultimate effect of monetary policy on investment and consump-tion demand, however, is less immediate than that of fiscal policy.   \n  Supply-Side Policies \n Fiscal policy and monetary policy are demand-oriented tools that affect the economy by stimulating the total demand for goods and services. The implicit belief is that the econ-omy will not by itself arrive at a full employment equilibrium and that macroeconomic policy can push the economy toward this goal. In contrast, supply-side policies treat the issue of the productive capacity of the economy. The goal is to create an environment in which workers and owners of capital have the maximum incentive and ability to produce and develop goods.  Suppose the government wants to stimulate the \neconomy without increasing interest rates. What combination of fiscal and monetary policy might accomplish this goal?

Whereas \ndemand-siders look at the effect of taxes on consumption demand, supply-siders focus \non incentives and marginal tax rates. They argue that \nlowering tax rates will elicit more investment and improve incentives to work, thereby enhancing eco-nomic growth. Some go so far as to claim that reduc-tions in tax rates can lead to increases in tax revenues because the lower tax rates will cause the economy and the revenue tax base to grow by more than the tax rate is reduced.     \n   17.5 Business Cycles \n  We\u2019ve looked at the tools the government uses to fine-tune the economy, attempting to maintain low unemployment and low inflation. Despite these efforts, economies repeat-edly seem to pass through good and bad times. One determinant of the broad asset alloca-tion decision of many analysts is a forecast of whether the macroeconomy is improving or deteriorating. A forecast that differs from the market consensus can have a major impact on investment strategy.  \n   The Business Cycle \n The economy recurrently experiences periods of expansion and contraction, although the length and depth of those cycles can be irregular. This recurring pattern of recession and recovery is called the    business cycle    .   Figure\u00a0 17.3  presents graphs of several measures \nof production and output. The production series all show clear variation around a gener-ally rising trend. The bottom graph of capacity utilization also evidences a clear cyclical (although irregular) pattern.  \n The transition points across cycles are called peaks and troughs, indicated by the left \nand right edges of the shaded regions in  Figure\u00a017.3 . A    peak    is the transition from the end \nof an expansion to the start of a contraction. A    trough    occurs at the bottom of a recession \njust as the economy enters a recovery. The shaded areas in  Figure\u00a017.3  therefore all repre-sent periods of recession. \n As the economy passes through different stages of the business cycle, the relative perfor-\nmance of different industry groups might be expected to vary. For example, at a trough, just before the economy begins to recover from a recession, one would expect that    cyclical \nindustries    ,   those with above-average sensitivity to the state of the economy, would tend to \noutperform other industries. Examples of cyclical industries are producers of durable goods such as automobiles. Because purchases of these goods can be deferred during a recession, sales are particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Other cyclical industries are pro-ducers of capital goods, that is, goods used by other firms to produce their own products. When demand is slack, few companies will be expanding and purchasing capital goods. Therefore, the capital goods industry bears the brunt of a slowdown but does well in an expansion. \n In contrast to cyclical firms,    defensive industries    have little sensitivity to the business \ncycle. These are industries that produce goods for which sales and profits are least sensitive to the state of the economy. Defensive industries include food producers and processors, pharmaceutical firms, and public utilities. These industries will outperform others when the economy enters a recession. \n The cyclical/defensive classification corresponds well to the notion of systematic or \nmarket risk introduced in our discussion of portfolio theory. When perceptions about the health of the economy become more optimistic, for example, the prices of most stocks will  Large tax cuts in 2001 were followed by relatively \nrapid growth in GDP. How would demand-side and supply-side economists differ in their inter-pretations of this phenomenon?

Conversely, defensive firms will have low betas and performance that is relatively \n unaffected by overall market conditions. \n If your assessments of the state of the business cycle were reliably more accurate than \nthose of other investors, you would simply choose cyclical industries when you are rela-\ntively more optimistic about the economy and defensive firms when you are relatively \nmore pessimistic. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to determine when the economy is \npassing through a peak or a trough. It if were, choosing between cyclical and defensive \nindustries would be easy. As we know from our discussion of efficient markets, however, \nattractive investment choices will rarely be obvious. It usually is not apparent that a reces-\nsion or expansion has started or ended until several months after the fact. With hindsight, \nthe transitions from expansion to recession and back might be apparent, but it is often quite \ndifficult to say whether the economy is heating up or slowing down at any moment.  \n  Economic Indicators \n Given the cyclical nature of the business cycle, it is not surprising that to some extent \nthe cycle can be predicted. A set of cyclical indicators computed by the Conference \nBoard helps forecast, measure, and interpret short-term fluctuations in economic activity. \n   Leading economic indicators    are those economic series that tend to rise or fall in advance \nof the rest of the economy.  Coincident   and  lagging indicators,   as their names suggest, \nmove in tandem with or somewhat after the broad economy. \n Ten series are grouped into a widely followed composite index of leading economic \nindicators. Similarly, four coincident and seven lagging indicators form separate indexes. \nThe composition of these indexes appears in  Table\u00a017.2 .  \nSource: The Conference Board,  Business Cycle Indicators,   November 2012.A.

The dates at the top of the chart correspond to \nturning points between expansions and contractions. While the index of leading indica-\ntors consistently turns before the rest of the economy, its lead time is somewhat erratic. \nMoreover, the lead time for peaks is consistently longer than that for troughs.  \n The stock market price index is a leading indicator. This is as it should be, as stock \nprices are forward-looking predictors of future profitability. Unfortunately, this makes the \nseries of leading indicators much less useful for investment policy\u2014by the time the series \npredicts an upturn, the market has already made its move. Although the business cycle may \nbe somewhat predictable, the stock market may not be. This is just one more manifestation \nof the efficient markets hypothesis. \n The money supply is another leading indicator. This makes sense in light of our earlier \ndiscussion concerning the lags surrounding the effects of monetary policy on the economy. \n Figure 17.4 Indexes of leading, coincident, and lagging indicators   \n Note: Shaded areas represent recessions.  \n Source: The Conference Board,  Business Cycle Indicators,   December 2008.

Therefore, today\u2019s monetary policy might well predict future \neconomic activity. \n Other leading indicators focus directly on decisions made today that will affect production \nin the near future. For example, manufacturers\u2019 new orders for goods, contracts and orders \nfor plant and equipment, and housing starts all signal a coming expansion in the economy. \n A wide range of economic indicators is released to the public on a regular \u201ceconomic \ncalendar.\u201d  Table\u00a017.3  is an \u201ceconomic calendar,\u201d listing the public announcement dates and \nsources for about 20 statistics of interest.

Just as \nit is difficult for an industry to perform well when the macroeconomy is ailing, it is unusual \nfor a firm in a troubled industry to perform well. Similarly, just as we have seen that eco-\nnomic performance can vary widely across countries, performance also can vary widely \nacross industries.  Figure\u00a017.6  illustrates the dispersion of industry performance. It shows \nreturn on equity based on 2012 profitability for several major industry groups. ROE ranged \nfrom 6.7% for money center banks to 29.6% in the restaurant industry.  \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   571bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   571 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\n5 7 2 PART V  Security Analysis\n CEO polls \n    www.businessroundtable.org    The business roundtable surveys CEOs about planned  capital \nspending, a good measure of their optimism about the economy. \n Temp jobs \n(search for \u201cTemporary Help Services\u201d) \n    www.bls.gov    A useful leading indicator.

Figure\u00a017.7  presents \nthe stock market performance of the same industries included in  Figure\u00a017.6 . The spread \nin performance is remarkable, ranging from a 57.3% gain in the home improvement \nindustry to only 2.6% in the oil and gas industry. This range of performance was very \nmuch available to virtually all investors in 2012. Recall that iShares are exchange-traded \nfunds (see Chapter 4) that trade like stocks and thus allow even small investors to take \na position in each traded industry. Alternatively, one can invest in mutual funds with an \nindustry focus. For example, Fidelity offers over 40 sector funds, each with a particular \nindustry focus.   \n   Defining an Industry \n Although we know what we mean by an \u201cindustry,\u201d deciding where to draw the line \nbetween one industry and another can be difficult in practice. Consider, for example, one \nof the industries depicted in  Figure\u00a017.6 , application software firms. Industry ROE in 2012 \nwas 24.9%. But there is substantial variation within this group by focus, and one might \nwell be justified in further dividing these firms into distinct subindustries. Their differ-\nences may result in considerable dispersion in financial performance.  Figure\u00a017.8  shows \nROE for a sample of the firms included in this industry, confirming that 2012 performance \ndid indeed vary widely: from 7.9% for Nuance to 30.3% for Intuit.  \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   573bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   573 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\n5 7 4 PART V  Security Analysis\n A useful way to define industry groups in practice is given by the North American \nIndustry Classification System, or    NAICS codes    .   2   These are codes assigned to group firms \nfor statistical analysis. The first two digits of the NAICS codes denote very broad industry \nclassifications. For example,  Table\u00a017.5  shows that the codes for all construction firms start \nwith 23. The next digits define the industry grouping more narrowly. For example, codes \nstarting with 236 denote  building   construction, 2361 denotes  residential   construction, and \n236115 denotes  single-family   construction. The first five digits of the NAICS codes are \ncommon across all three NAFTA countries. The sixth digit is country-specific and allows \nfor a finer partition of industries. Firms with the same four-digit NAICS codes are \ncommonly taken to be in the same industry.   \n NAICS industry classifications are not perfect. For example, both JCPenney and Neiman \nMarcus might be classified as \u201cDepartment Stores.\u201d Yet the former is a  high-volume \n\u201cvalue\u201d store, whereas the latter is a high-margin elite retailer. Are they really in the same \nindustry? Still, these classifications are a tremendous aid in conducting industry analysis \nbecause they provide a means of focusing on very broad or fairly narrowly defined groups \nof firms. \n Several other industry classifications are provided by other analysts; for example, \nStandard & Poor\u2019s reports on the performance of about 100 industry groups. S&P com-\nputes stock price indexes for each group, which is useful in assessing past investment \n Figure 17.8 ROE of major software development firms  \n Source: Yahoo!

Not all industries are equally sensitive \nto the business cycle. \n For example,  Figure\u00a017.9  plots changes in retail sales (year over year) in two indus-\ntries: jewelry and grocery stores. Clearly, sales of jewelry, which is a luxury good, fluctu-\nate more widely than those of groceries.

In contrast, \nsales growth in the grocery industry is relatively stable, with no years in which sales \nmeaningfully decline. These patterns reflect the fact that jewelry is a discretionary good, \nwhereas most grocery products are staples for which demand will not fall significantly \neven in hard times.  \n Three factors will determine the sensitivity of a firm\u2019s earnings to the business cycle. \nFirst is the sensitivity of sales. Necessities will show little sensitivity to business condi-\ntions. Examples of industries in this group are food, drugs, and medical services. Other \nindustries with low sensitivity are those for which income is not a crucial determinant of \ndemand. Tobacco products are an example of this type of industry. Another industry in \nthis group is movies, because consumers tend to substitute movies for more expensive \nsources of entertainment when income levels are low. In contrast, firms in industries such \nas machine tools, steel, autos, and transportation are highly sensitive to the state of the \neconomy. \n The second factor determining business cycle sensitivity is operating leverage, which \nrefers to the division between fixed and variable costs. (Fixed costs are those the firm \nincurs regardless of its production levels. Variable costs are those that rise or fall as the \nfirm produces more or less product.) Firms with greater amounts of variable as opposed to \nfixed costs will be less sensitive to business conditions. This is because in economic down-\nturns, these firms can reduce costs as output falls in response to falling sales. Profits for \nfirms with high fixed costs will swing more widely with sales because costs do not move to \noffset revenue variability. Firms with high fixed costs are said to have high operating lever-\nage, because small swings in business conditions can have large impacts on profitability.  \n Consider two firms operating in the same industry with identical revenues in all phases \nof the business cycle: recession, normal, and expansion. Firm A has short-term leases on \nmost of its equipment and can reduce its lease expenditures when production slackens. \nIt has fixed costs of $5 million and variable costs of $1 per unit of output. Firm B has \nlong-term leases on most of its equipment and must make lease payments regardless of \neconomic conditions. Its fixed costs are higher, $8 million, but its variable costs are only \n$.50 per unit.  Table\u00a017.6  shows that Firm A will do better in recessions than Firm B, but \nnot as well in expansions. A\u2019s costs move in conjunction with its revenues to help perfor-\nmance in downturns and impede performance in upturns.

The    degree of operating leverage    ,  or DOL, is defined as\n   D O L5Percentage change in profits\nPercenta ge chan ge in sales  \n DOL greater than 1 indicates some operating leverage. For example, if DOL\u00a0 5 \u00a02, then for \nevery 1% change in sales, profits will change by 2% in the same direction, either up or down. \n We have seen that the degree of operating leverage increases with a firm\u2019s exposure to \nfixed costs. In fact, one can show that DOL depends on fixed costs in the following manner:  3   \n   D O L511Fixed costs\nProfits   \n What will be profits in the three scenarios for Firm C with fixed costs of $2 million and variable costs of \n$1.50 per unit? What are your conclusions regarding operating leverage and business risk?  CONCEPT CHECK 17.4  Return to the two firms illustrated in  Table\u00a017.6  and compare profits and sales in the \nnormal scenario for the economy with those in a recession. Profits of Firm A fall by \n100% (from $1 million to zero) when sales fall by 16.7% (from $6 million to $5 million):\n   DOL(Firm A )5Percentage change in profits\nPercenta ge chan ge in sales52100%\n216.7%56  \n We can confirm the relationship between DOL and fixed costs as follows:\n   DOL(Firm A )511Fixed costs\nProfits511$5 million\n$1 million56  \n Firm B has higher fixed costs, and its operating leverage is higher. Again, compare data \nfor a normal scenario to a recession. Profits for Firm B fall by 150%, from $1 million to  2 $.5 million. Operating leverage for Firm B is therefore\n   DOL(Firm B )5Percentage change in profits\nPercenta ge chan ge in sales52150%\n216.7%59  \n which reflects its higher level of fixed costs:\n   DOL(Firm B )511Fixed costs\nProfits511$8 million\n$1 million59   Example 17.2 Degree of Operating Leverage \n  3 Operating leverage and DOL are treated in more detail in most corporate finance texts.  The third factor influencing business cycle sensitivity is financial leverage, which is \nthe use of borrowing. Interest payments on debt must be paid regardless of sales. They are \nfixed costs that also increase the sensitivity of profits to business conditions. (We will have more to say about financial leverage in Chapter 19.) \n Investors should not always prefer industries with lower sensitivity to the business cycle. \nFirms in sensitive industries will have high-beta stocks and are riskier. But while they swing lower in downturns, they also swing higher in upturns. As always, the issue you need to address is whether the expected return on the investment is fair compensation for the risks borne.   \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   577bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   577 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\n5 7 8 PART V  Security Analysis\n  Sector Rotation \n One way that many analysts think about the relationship between industry analysis and \nthe business cycle is the notion of    sector rotation    .  The idea is to shift the portfolio more \nheavily into industry or sector groups that are expected to outperform based on one\u2019s \nassessment of the state of the business cycle. \n  Figure\u00a017.10  is a stylized depiction of the business cycle. Near the peak of the business \ncycle, the economy might be overheated with high inflation and interest rates, and price \npressures on basic commodities. This might be a good time to invest in firms engaged in \nnatural resource extraction and processing such as minerals or petroleum.  \n Following a peak, when the economy \nenters a contraction or recession, one \nwould expect defensive industries that \nare less sensitive to economic conditions, \nfor example, pharmaceuticals, food, and \nother necessities, to be the best perform-\ners. At the height of the contraction, \nfinancial firms will be hurt by shrinking \nloan volume and higher default rates. \nToward the end of the recession, however, \ncontractions induce lower inflation and \ninterest rates, which favor financial firms. \n At the trough of a recession, the \neconomy is poised for recovery and sub-\nsequent expansion. Firms might thus be \nspending on purchases of new equipment \nto meet anticipated increases in demand. \nThis, then, would be a good time to invest \nin capital goods industries, such as equip-\nment, transportation, or construction. \n Finally, in an expansion, the economy \nis growing rapidly. Cyclical industries such as \nconsumer durables and luxury items will be most \nprofitable in this stage of the cycle. Banks might \nalso do well in expansions, since loan volume will be \nhigh and default exposure low when the economy is \ngrowing rapidly. \n  Figure\u00a0 17.11  illustrates sector rotation. When \ninvestors are relatively pessimistic about the econ-\nomy, they will shift into noncyclical industries such \nas consumer staples or health care. When antici-\npating an expansion, they will prefer more cyclical \nindustries such as materials and technology.  \n Let us emphasize again that sector rotation, like \nany other form of market timing, will be successful \nonly if one anticipates the next stage of the business \ncycle better than other investors. The business cycle \ndepicted in  Figure\u00a0 17.10  is highly stylized. In real \nlife, it is never as clear how long each phase of the \ncycle will last, nor how extreme it will be.

Do the same for \nthe public utility industry and you will find lower rates of return, lower investment rates, \nand higher dividend payout rates. Why should this be? \n The biotech industry is still new. Recently, available technologies have created opportu-\nnities for highly profitable investment of resources. New products are protected by patents, \nand profit margins are high. With such lucrative investment opportunities, firms find it \nadvantageous to put all profits back into the firm. The companies grow rapidly on average. \n Eventually, however, growth must slow. The high profit rates will induce new firms to \nenter the industry. Increasing competition will hold down prices and profit margins. New \ntechnologies become proven and more predictable, risk levels fall, and entry becomes even \neasier. As internal investment opportunities become less attractive, a lower fraction of prof-\nits is reinvested in the firm. Cash dividends increase. \n Ultimately, in a mature industry, we observe \u201ccash cows,\u201d firms with stable dividends \nand cash flows and little risk. Growth rates might be similar to that of the overall economy. \nIndustries in early states of their life cycles offer high-risk/high-potential-return invest-\nments. Mature industries offer lower-risk, lower-return profiles. \n This analysis suggests that a typical    industry life cycle    might be described by four \nstages: a start-up stage, characterized by extremely rapid growth; a consolidation stage, \ncharacterized by growth that is less rapid but \nstill faster than that of the general economy; a \nmaturity stage, characterized by growth no faster \nthan the general economy; and a stage of rela-\ntive decline, in which the industry grows less \nrapidly than the rest of the economy, or actually \nshrinks. This industry life cycle is illustrated in \n Figure\u00a0 17.12 . Let us turn to an elaboration of \neach of these stages.  \n  Start-Up Stage   The early stages of an \nindustry are often characterized by a new tech-\nnology or product such as desktop personal com-\nputers in the 1980s, cell phones in the 1990s, \nor the new generation of smart phones intro-\nduced more recently. At this stage, it is difficult \nto predict which firms will emerge as industry \nleaders. Some firms will turn out to be wildly  In which phase of the business cycle would you expect the following industries to enjoy their best \nperformance? \n     a.  Newspapers  \n    b.

Therefore, there is considerable risk in selecting \none  particular firm within the industry. For example, in the smart phone industry, there is still a battle among competing technologies, such as Google\u2019s Android phones and Apple\u2019s iPhone, and it is difficult to predict ultimate market shares. \n At the industry level, however, it is clear that sales and earnings will grow at an extremely \nrapid rate because the new product has not yet saturated its market. For example, in 2010, relatively few households had smart phones. The potential market for the product therefore was huge. In contrast to this situation, consider the market for a mature product like refrig-erators. Almost all households in the United States already have refrigerators, so the mar-ket for this good is primarily composed of households replacing old ones. Obviously, the growth rate in this market in the next decade will be far lower than that for smart phones.  \n  Consolidation Stage   After a product becomes established, industry leaders begin \nto emerge. The survivors from the start-up stage are more stable, and market share is easier \nto predict. Therefore, the performance of the surviving firms will more closely track the performance of the overall industry. The industry still grows faster than the rest of the economy as the product penetrates the marketplace and becomes more commonly used.  \n  Maturity Stage   At this point, the product has reached its full potential for use by \nconsumers. Further growth might merely track growth in the general economy. The prod-\nuct has become far more standardized, and producers are forced to compete to a greater extent on the basis of price. This leads to narrower profit margins and further pressure on profits. Firms at this stage sometimes are characterized as cash cows, having reasonably stable cash flow but offering little opportunity for profitable expansion. The cash flow is best \u201cmilked from\u201d rather than reinvested in the company. \n We pointed to desktop PCs as a start-up industry in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s it \nwas a mature industry, with high market penetration, considerable price competition, low profit margins, and slowing sales. By the 1990s, desktops were progressively giving way to laptops, which were in their own start-up stage. Within a dozen years, laptops had in turn entered a maturity stage, with standardization, considerable market penetration, and dramatic price competition. Today, tablet computers are in a start-up stage.  \n  Relative Decline   In this stage, the industry might grow at less than the rate of the \noverall economy, or it might even shrink. This could be due to obsolescence of the product, \ncompetition from new low-cost suppliers, or competition from new products; consider for example, the steady displacement of desktops, first by laptops and now by tablets. \n At which stage in the life cycle are investments in an industry most attractive? \nConventional wisdom is that investors should seek firms in high-growth industries. This recipe for success is simplistic, however. If the security prices already reflect the likeli-hood for high growth, then it is too late to make money from that knowledge. Moreover, high growth and fat profits encourage competition from other producers. The exploitation of profit opportunities brings about new sources of supply that eventually reduce prices, profits, investment returns, and finally growth. This is the dynamic behind the progression from one stage of the industry life cycle to another. The famous portfolio manager Peter Lynch makes this point in  One Up on Wall Street:  \n  Many people prefer to invest in a high-growth industry, where there\u2019s a lot of sound and \nfury. Not me. I prefer to invest in a low-growth industry.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. In a low-growth industry, especially one that\u2019s boring and upsets people [such as funeral homes or the oil-drum retrieval business], there\u2019s no problem with competition. You don\u2019t have to protect your flanks from potential rivals .\u00a0.\u00a0. and this gives you the leeway to continue to grow.  \n4     \n  4 Peter Lynch with John Rothchild,  One Up on Wall Street  (New York: Penguin, p. 131). \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   580bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   580 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 17 Macroeconomic and Industry Analysis 581\n In fact, Lynch uses an industry classification system in a very similar spirit to the life-\ncycle approach we have described. He places firms in the following six groups: \n  Slow Growers   Large and aging companies that will grow only slightly faster than the \nbroad economy. These firms have matured from their earlier fast-growth phase. They usu-\nally have steady cash flow and pay a generous dividend, indicating that the firm is generat-ing more cash than can be profitably reinvested in the firm.  \n  Stalwarts   Large, well-known firms like Coca-Cola, Hershey\u2019s, or Colgate-Palmolive. They \ngrow faster than the slow growers, but are not in the very rapid growth start-up stage. \nThey also tend to be in noncyclical industries that are relatively unaffected by recessions.  \n  Fast Growers   Small and aggressive new firms with annual growth rates in the neigh-\nborhood of 20% to 25%. Company growth can be due to broad industry growth or to an \nincrease in market share in a more mature industry.  \n  Cyclicals   These are firms with sales and profits that regularly expand and contract along \nwith the business cycle. Examples are auto companies, steel companies, or the construc-tion industry.  \n  Turnarounds   These are firms that are in bankruptcy or soon might be. If they can recover \nfrom what might appear to be imminent disaster, they can offer tremendous investment returns. A good example of this type of firm would be Chrysler in 1982, when it required a government guarantee on its debt to avoid bankruptcy. The stock price rose 15-fold in the next 5 years.  \n  Asset Plays   These are firms that have valuable assets not currently reflected in the stock \nprice. For example, a company may own or be located on valuable real estate that is worth \nas much as or more than the company\u2019s business enterprises. Sometimes the hidden asset can be tax-loss carryforwards. Other times the assets may be intangible. For example, a cable company might have a valuable list of cable subscribers. These assets do not immediately generate cash flow, and so may be more easily overlooked by other analysts attempting to value the firm.    \n  Industry Structure and Performance \n The maturation of an industry involves regular changes in the firm\u2019s competitive environ-ment. As a final topic, we examine the relationship among industry structure, competitive strategy, and profitability. Michael Porter has highlighted these five determinants of com-petition: threat of entry from new competitors, rivalry between existing competitors, price pressure from substitute products, bargaining power of buyers, and bargaining power of suppliers.  \n5    \n  Threat of Entry   New entrants to an industry put pressure on price and profits. Even \nif a firm has not yet entered an industry, the potential for it to do so places pressure on \nprices, because high prices and profit margins will encourage entry by new competitors. Therefore, barriers to entry can be a key determinant of industry profitability. Barriers can take many forms. For example, existing firms may already have secure distribution chan-nels for their products based on long-standing relationships with customers or suppliers \n  5 Michael Porter,  Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance  (New York: Free Press, \n1985). \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   581bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   581 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm582 PART V  Security Analysis\nthat would be costly for a new entrant to duplicate. Brand loyalty also makes it difficult \nfor new entrants to penetrate a market and gives firms more pricing discretion. Propri-etary knowledge or patent protection also may give firms advantages in serving a market. Finally, an existing firm\u2019s experience in a market may give it cost advantages due to the learning that takes place over time.  \n  Rivalry between Existing Competitors   When there are several competitors in \nan industry, there will generally be more price competition and lower profit margins as \ncompetitors seek to expand their share of the market. Slow industry growth contributes to this competition, because expansion must come at the expense of a rival\u2019s market share. High fixed costs also create pressure to reduce prices, because fixed costs put greater pres-sure on firms to operate near full capacity. Industries producing relatively homogeneous goods are also subject to considerable price pressure, because firms cannot compete on the basis of product differentiation.  \n  Pressure from Substitute Products   Substitute products means that the industry \nfaces competition from firms in related industries. For example, sugar producers compete \nwith corn syrup producers. Wool producers compete with synthetic fiber producers. The availability of substitutes limits the prices that can be charged to customers.  \n  Bargaining Power of Buyers   If a buyer purchases a large fraction of an indus-\ntry\u2019s output, it will have considerable bargaining power and can demand price concessions. \nFor example, auto producers can put pressure on suppliers of auto parts. This reduces the  profitability of the auto parts industry.  \n  Bargaining Power of Suppliers   If a supplier of a key input has monopolistic \ncontrol over the product, it can demand higher prices for the good and squeeze profits \nout of the industry. One special case of this issue pertains to organized labor as a supplier of a key input to the production process. Labor unions engage in collective bargaining to increase the wages paid to workers. When the labor market is highly unionized, a signifi-cant share of the potential profits in the industry can be captured by the workforce. \n The key factor determining the bargaining power of suppliers is the availability of sub-\nstitute products. If substitutes are available, the supplier has little clout and cannot extract higher prices.      \n           1 .   Macroeconomic policy aims to maintain the economy near full employment without aggravat-\ning inflationary pressures. The proper trade-off between these two goals is a source of ongoing debate.  \n    2 .   The traditional tools of macropolicy are government spending and tax collection, which consti-tute fiscal policy, and manipulation of the money supply via monetary policy. Expansionary fiscal policy can stimulate the economy and increase GDP but tends to increase interest rates. Expan-sionary monetary policy works by lowering interest rates.  \n    3 .   The business cycle is the economy\u2019s recurring pattern of expansions and recessions. Leading eco-nomic indicators can be used to anticipate the evolution of the business cycle because their values tend to change before those of other key economic variables.  \n    4 .   Industries differ in their sensitivity to the business cycle. More sensitive industries tend to be those producing high-priced durable goods for which the consumer has considerable discretion as to the timing of purchase. Examples are jewelry, automobiles, or consumer durables. Other sensi-tive industries are those that produce capital equipment for other firms. Operating leverage and financial leverage increase sensitivity to the business cycle.

IAAI also provides advice to a select group of individual investors with large portfolios. One of the claims the firm makes in its advertising is that IAAI devotes considerable resources to forecasting and determining long-term trends; then it uses com-monly accepted investment models to determine how these trends should affect the performance of various investments. The members of the research department of IAAI recently reached some con-clusions concerning some important macroeconomic trends. For instance, they have seen an upward trend in job creation and consumer confidence and predict that this should continue for the next few years. Other domestic leading indicators that the research department at IAAI wishes to consider are industrial production, average weekly hours in manufacturing, S&P 500 stock prices, M2 money supply, and the index of consumer expectations. \n In light of the predictions for job creation and consumer confidence, the investment advisers at \nIAAI want to make recommendations for their clients. They use established theories that relate job creation and consumer confidence to inflation and interest rates and then incorporate the forecast movements in inflation and interest rates into established models for explaining asset prices. Their primary concern is to forecast how the trends in job creation and consumer confidence should affect bond prices and how those trends should affect stock prices. \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   584bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   584 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 17 Macroeconomic and Industry Analysis 585\n The members of the research department at IAAI also note that stocks have been trending up \nin the past year, and this information is factored into the forecasts of the overall economy that they \ndeliver.

Her first assignment is to examine the competitive strategies employed by various French wineries. \n Smith\u2019s report identifies four wineries that are the major players in the French wine industry.

Profit margins have declined steadily and the number of firms representing the industry has decreased from 10 to 4.

Restaurants typically make purchases in bulk, buying four to fi  ve cases of wine at a time.  \n  \u2022  Land where the soil is fertile enough to grow grapes necessary for the wine production \nprocess is scarce in France.    \n After completing the first draft of her report, Smith takes it to her boss, RonVanDriesen, to review. \nVanDriesen tells her that he is a wine connoisseur himself, and often makes purchases from the \nSouth Winery. Smith tells VanDriesen, \u201cIn my report I have classified the South Winery as a stuck-\nin-the-middle firm. It tries to be a cost leader by selling its wine at a price that is slightly below the \nother firms, but it also tries to differentiate itself from its competitors by producing wine in bottles \nwith curved necks, which increases its cost structure. The end result is that the South Winery\u2019s profit \nmargin gets squeezed from both sides.\u201d  VanDriesen replies, \u201cI have met members of the management \nteam from the South Winery at a couple of the wine conventions I have attended. I believe that the \nSouth Winery could succeed at following both a cost leadership and a differentiation strategy if its \noperations were separated into distinct operating units, with each unit pursuing a different competi-\ntive strategy.\u201d Smith makes a note to do more research on generic competitive strategies to verify \nVanDriesen\u2019s assertions before publishing the final draft of her report.\n    22. If the French home currency were to greatly appreciate in value compared to the English \n currency, what is the likely impact on the competitive position of the East Winery?\n     a .   Make the firm less competitive in the English market.  \n    b .   No impact, since the major market for East Winery is England, not France.  \n    c.  Make the firm more competitive in the English market.     \n   23. Which of Smith\u2019s points effectively support the conclusion that consumers have strong bargain-\ning power over the industry?  \n   24. Smith notes in her report that the West Winery might differentiate its wine product on attributes \nthat buyers perceive to be important. Which of the following attributes would be the  most likely   \narea of focus for the West Winery to create a differentiated product?\n     a .   The method of delivery for the product.  \n    b .   The price of the product.  \n    c.  A focus on customers aged 30 to 45.     \n   25. Smith knows that a firm\u2019s generic strategy should be the centerpiece of a firm\u2019s strategic plan. \nOn the basis of a compilation of research and documents, Smith makes three observations about \nthe North Winery and its strategic planning process:\n    i. North Winery\u2019s price and cost forecasts account for future changes in the structure of the \nFrench wine industry.  \n   ii. North Winery places each of its business units into one of three categories: build, hold, or \nharvest.  \n   iii. North Winery uses market share as the key measure of its competitive position.    \n Which of these observation(s)  least   support the conclusion that the North Winery\u2019s strategic planning \nprocess is guided and informed by its generic competitive strategy?         \n    1. Briefly discuss what actions the U.S. Federal Reserve would likely take in pursuing an  expan-\nsionary   monetary policy using each of the following three monetary tools:\n     a .

Universal Auto is a large multinational corporation headquartered in the United States. For seg-\nment reporting purposes, the company is engaged in two businesses: production of motor vehicles \nand information processing services. \n    The motor vehicle business is by far the larger of Universal\u2019s two segments. It consists mainly \nof domestic U.S. passenger car production, but it also includes small truck manufacturing opera-tions in the United States and passenger car production in other countries. This segment of Uni-versal has had weak operating results for the past several years, including a large loss in 2013. Although the company does not reveal the operating results of its domestic passenger car seg-ments, that part of Universal\u2019s business is generally believed to be primarily responsible for the weak performance of its motor vehicle segment. \n    Idata, the information processing services segment of Universal, was started by Universal \nabout 15 years ago. This business has shown strong, steady growth that has been entirely internal; no acquisitions have been made. \n    An excerpt from a research report on Universal prepared by Paul Adams, a CFA candidate, \nstates: \u201cBased on our assumption that Universal will be able to increase prices significantly on U.S. passenger cars in 2014, we project a multibillion dollar profit improvement.\u201d\n     a .   Discuss the concept of an industrial life cycle by describing each of its four phases.  \n    b .   Identify where each of Universal\u2019s two primary businesses\u2014passenger cars and information \nprocessing\u2014is in such a cycle.  \n    c.  Discuss how product pricing should differ between Universal\u2019s two businesses, based on the location of each in the industrial life cycle.     \n   4. Adams\u2019s research report (see the preceding problem) continued as follows: \u201cWith a business \nrecovery already under way, the expected profit surge should lead to a much higher price for Universal Auto stock. We strongly recommend purchase.\u201d\n     a .   Discuss the business cycle approach to investment timing. (Your answer should describe \nactions to be taken on both stocks and bonds at different points over a typical business cycle.)  \n    b .   Assuming Adams\u2019s assertion is correct (that a business recovery is already under way), evalu-ate the timeliness of his recommendation to purchase Universal Auto, a cyclical stock, based on the business cycle approach to investment timing.     \n   5. Janet Ludlow is preparing a report on U.S.-based manufacturers in the electric toothbrush indus-\ntry and has gathered the information shown in  Tables 17B  and  17C .

As a securities analyst you have been asked to review a valuation of a closely held business, \nWigwam Autoparts Heaven, Inc. (WAH), prepared by the Red Rocks Group (RRG). You are \nto give an opinion on the valuation and to support your opinion by analyzing each part of the valuation. WAH\u2019s sole business is automotive parts retailing. The RRG valuation includes a sec-tion called \u201cAnalysis of the Retail Autoparts Industry,\u201d based completely on the data in  Table\u00a017D  and the following additional information: \n   \u2022  WAH and its principal competitors each operated more than 150 stores at year-end 2012.  \n  \u2022  The average number of stores operated per company engaged in the retail autoparts industry is 5.3.  \n  \u2022  The major customer base for autoparts sold in retail stores consists of young owners of old \nvehicles. These owners do their own automotive maintenance out of economic necessity.\n     a .   One of RRG\u2019s conclusions is that the retail autoparts industry as a whole is in the maturity stage of the industry life cycle. Discuss three relevant items of data from  Table\u00a017D  that sup-port this conclusion.  \n    b .   Another RRG conclusion is that WAH and its principal competitors are in the consolidation stage of their life cycle.\n    i. Cite three relevant items of data from  Table\u00a017D  that support this conclusion.  \n   ii. Explain how WAH and its principal competitors can be in a consolidation stage while \ntheir industry as a whole is in the maturity stage.           \n   7 .      a.   If the exchange rate value of the British pound goes from U.S.$1.75 to U.S.$1.55, then the \npound has:\n    i. Appreciated and the British will find U.S. goods cheaper.  \n   ii. Appreciated and the British will find U.S. goods more expensive.     iii. Depreciated and the British will find U.S. goods more expensive.     iv. Depreciated and the British will find U.S. goods cheaper.     \n    b .   Changes in which of the following are likely to affect interest rates?\n    i. Inflation expectations.  \n   ii. Size of the federal deficit.     iii. Money supply.     \n    c.  According to the supply-side view of fiscal policy, if the impact on total tax revenues is the same, does it make any difference whether the government cuts taxes by either reducing mar-ginal tax rates or increasing the personal exemption allowance?\n    i. No, both methods of cutting taxes will exert the same impact on aggregate supply.  \n   ii. No, people in both cases will increase their saving, expecting higher future taxes, and \nthereby offset the stimulus effect of lower current taxes.      \u2022   Industry Sales Growth \u2014Industry sales have grown at 15\u201320% per year in recent years and are expected to grow at 10\u201315% \nper year over the next 3 years.  \n  \u2022   Non-U.S. Markets \u2014Some U.S. manufacturers are attempting to enter fast-growing non-U.S. markets, which remain largely \nunexploited.  \n  \u2022   Mail Order Sales \u2014Some manufacturers have created a new niche in the industry by selling electric toothbrushes directly \nto customers through mail order. Sales for this industry segment are growing at 40% per year.  \n  \u2022   U.S. Market Penetration \u2014The current penetration rate in the United States is 60% of households and will be difficult to \nincrease.  \n  \u2022  Price Competition \u2014Manufacturers compete fiercely on the basis of price, and price wars within the industry are common.  \n  \u2022   Niche Markets \u2014Some manufacturers are able to develop new, unexploited niche markets in the United States based on \n company reputation, quality, and service.  \n  \u2022   Industry Consolidation \u2014Several manufacturers have recently merged, and it is expected that consolidation in the \nindustry will increase.  \n  \u2022  New Entrants \u2014New manufacturers continue to enter the market.    \nTable 17C\nCharacteristics of the electric toothbrush manufacturing industry\nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   588bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   588 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 17 Macroeconomic and Industry Analysis 589\n   iii. Yes, the lower marginal tax rates alone will increase the incentive to earn marginal income \nand thereby stimulate aggregate supply.  \n   iv. Yes, interest rates will increase if marginal tax rates are lowered, whereas they will tend to \ndecrease if the personal exemption allowance is raised.

The downturn in the auto industry will reduce the demand for the product of this economy. The \neconomy will, at least in the short term, enter a recession. This would suggest that:\n    a .   GDP will fall.  \n   b .   The unemployment rate will rise.     c .   The government deficit will increase. Income tax receipts will fall, and government \nexpenditures on social welfare programs probably will increase.  \n   d .   Interest rates should fall. The contraction in the economy will reduce the demand for credit. \nMoreover, the lower inflation rate will reduce nominal interest rates.     \n   2. Expansionary fiscal policy coupled with expansionary monetary policy will stimulate the \neconomy, with the loose monetary policy keeping down interest rates.  \n   3. A traditional demand-side interpretation of the tax cuts is that the resulting increase in after-tax \nincome increased consumption demand and stimulated the economy. A supply-side interpretation is that the reduction in marginal tax rates made it more attractive for businesses to invest and for individuals to work, thereby increasing economic output.  \n   4. Firm C has the lowest fixed cost and highest variable costs. It should be least sensitive to the \nbusiness cycle. In fact, it is. Its profits are highest of the three firms in recessions but lowest in expansions.\n    Recession    Normal    Expansion  \n Revenue  $10   $12  $14  \n Fixed cost  2   2  2  \n Variable cost    7.5     9     10.5  \n  Profits  $ 0.5  $  1  $  1.5 \n   5 .      a.  Newspapers will do best in an expansion when advertising volume is increasing.  \n   b .   Machine tools are a good investment at the trough of a recession, just as the economy is about \nto enter an expansion and firms may need to increase capacity.  \n   c .   Beverages are defensive investments, with demand that is relatively insensitive to the business \ncycle. Therefore, they are relatively attractive investments if a recession is forecast.  \n   d .   Timber is a good investment at a peak period, when natural resource prices are high and the \neconomy is operating at full capacity.            \nbod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   590bod61671_ch17_557-590.indd   590 7/17/13   4:06 PM7/17/13   4:06 PMFinal PDF to printer\n     188 PART V    AS OUR DISCUSSION \u00a0of market efficiency \nindicated, finding undervalued securities \nis hardly easy. At the same time, there are enough chinks in the armor of the efficient market hypothesis that the search for such securities should not be dismissed out of hand. Moreover, it is the ongoing search for mispriced securities that maintains a nearly efficient market. Even minor mispricing would allow a stock market analyst to earn his salary. \n This chapter describes the valuation mod-\nels that stock market analysts use to uncover \nmispriced securities. The models presented are those used by  fundamental analysts,\nthose analysts who use information concern-ing the current and prospective profitability of a company to assess its fair market value. We start with a discussion of alternative mea-sures of the value of a company. From there, we progress to quantitative tools called  divi-\ndend discount models,  which security ana-\nlysts commonly use to measure the value of a firm as an ongoing concern. Next we turn to price\u2013earnings, or P/E, ratios, explaining why they are of such interest to analysts but also highlighting some of their shortcomings. We explain how P/E ratios are tied to dividend valuation models and, more generally, to the growth prospects of the firm. \n We close the chapter with a discussion and \nextended example of free cash flow models \nused by analysts to value firms based on fore-casts of the cash flows that will be generated from the firms\u2019 business endeavors. Finally, we apply the several valuation tools covered in the chapter to a real firm and find some disparity in their conclusions\u2014a conundrum that will confront any security analyst\u2014and consider reasons for these discrepancies.   Equity Valuation Models  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN \n    18.1 Valuation by Comparables \n  The purpose of fundamental analysis is to identify stocks that are mispriced relative to some \nmeasure of \u201ctrue\u201d value that can be derived from observable financial data. There are many con-venient sources of relevant data. For U.S. companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission provides information at its EDGAR Web site,   www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml .  The SEC requires all \npublic companies (except foreign companies and companies with less than $10 million in assets and 500 shareholders) to file registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms electroni-cally through EDGAR. Anyone can access and download this information. Many Web sites such \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   591bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   591 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n5 9 2 PART V  Security Analysis\nas   finance.yahoo.com   ,    money.msn.com   ,  or   finance.google.com   also provide analysis \nand data derived from the EDGAR reports. \n  Table\u00a018.1  shows some financial highlights for Microsoft as well as some comparable \ndata for other firms in the software applications industry. The price per share of Microsoft\u2019s \ncommon stock is $30.63, and the total market value or capitalization of those shares (called \nmarket cap   for short) is $258 billion. Under the heading \u201cValuation,\u201d  Table\u00a018.1  shows the \nratio of Microsoft\u2019s stock price to five benchmarks. Its share price is 15.4 times its (per share) \nearnings in the most recent 12 months, 3.9 times its recent book value, 3.5 times its sales, and \n10.9 times its cash flow. The last valuation ratio, PEG, is the P/E ratio divided by the growth \nrate of earnings. We would expect more rapidly growing firms to sell at higher multiples of \ncurrent   earnings (more on this below), so PEG normalizes the P/E ratio by the growth rate.  \n These valuation ratios are commonly used to assess the valuation of one firm compared \nto others in the same industry, and we will consider all of them. The column to the right \ngives comparable ratios for other firms in the software applications industry. For example, \nan analyst might note that Microsoft\u2019s price/earnings ratio and price/CF ratio are both \nbelow the industry average. Microsoft\u2019s ratio of market value to  book value,   the net worth \nof the company as reported on the balance sheet, is also below industry norms, 3.9 versus \n10.5. These ratios might indicate that its stock is underpriced. However, Microsoft is a \nmore mature firm than many in the industry, and perhaps this discrepancy reflects a lower \nexpected future growth rate. In fact, its PEG ratio is nearly identical to the industry aver-\nage. Clearly, rigorous valuation models will be necessary to sort through these sometimes \nconflicting signals of value.  \n   Limitations of Book Value \n Shareholders in a firm are sometimes called \u201cresidual claimants,\u201d which means that the \nvalue of their stake is what is left over when the liabilities of the firm are subtracted from \n Table 18.1 \n Financial highlights \nfor Microsoft \nCorporation, \nSeptember 12, 2012  Price per share  $  30.63   \n Common shares outstanding (billion)  8.38   \n Market capitalization ($ billion)  $258   \n  Latest 12 Months      \n Sales ($ billion)  $  73.72   \n EBITDA ($ billion)  $  30.71   \n Net income ($ billion)  $  16.98   \n Earnings per share  $   2.00   \n  Valuation    Microsoft    Industry Avg  \n Price/Earnings  15.4  17.5 \n Price/Book  3.9  10.5 \n Price/Sales  3.5   \n Price/Cash flow  10.9  20.5 \n PEG  1.1  1.2 \n  Profitability       \n ROE (%)  27.5  24.9 \n ROA (%)  15.0   \n Operating profit margin (%)  37.9   \n Net profit margin (%)  23.0  23.2 \n Source: Compiled from data available at   finance.yahoo.com   ,  September 12, 2012. \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   592bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   592 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 593\nits assets. Shareholders\u2019 equity is this net worth. However, the values of both assets and \nliabilities recognized in financial statements are based on historical\u2014not current\u2014values. For example, the book value of an asset equals the  original  cost of acquisition less some \nadjustment for depreciation, even if the market price of that asset has changed over time. Moreover, depreciation allowances are used to allocate the original cost of the asset over several years, but do not reflect loss of actual value. \n Whereas book values are based on original cost, market values measure  current  values \nof assets and liabilities. The market value of the shareholders\u2019 equity investment equals the difference between the current values of all assets and liabilities. We\u2019ve emphasized that current values generally will not match historical ones. Equally or even more important, many assets, such as the value of a good brand name or specialized expertise developed over many years, may not even be included on the financial statements. Market prices therefore reflect the value of the firm as a going concern. It would be unusual if the market price of a stock were exactly equal to its book value. \n Can book value represent a \u201cfloor\u201d for the stock\u2019s price, below which level the market \nprice can never fall? Although Microsoft\u2019s book value per share in 2012 was less than its market price, other evidence disproves this notion. While it is not common, there are always some firms selling at a market price below book value. In 2012, for example, such troubled firms included Sprint/Nextel, Bank of America, Mitsubishi, and AOL. \n A better measure of a floor for the stock price is the firm\u2019s  liquidation value  per share. \nThis represents the amount of money that could be realized by breaking up the firm, selling its assets, repaying its debt, and distributing the remainder to the shareholders. If the mar-ket price of equity drops below liquidation value, the firm becomes attractive as a takeover target. A corporate raider would find it profitable to buy enough shares to gain control and then actually to liquidate. \n Another measure of firm value is the  replacement cost  of assets less liabilities. Some \nanalysts believe the market value of the firm cannot remain for long too far above its replacement cost because if it did, competitors would enter the market. The resulting com-petitive pressure would drive down the market value of all firms until they fell to replace-ment cost. \n This idea is popular among economists, and the ratio of market price to replacement cost \nis known as  Tobin\u2019s q,   after the Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist James Tobin. In the long \nrun, according to this view, the ratio of market price to replacement cost will tend toward 1, but the evidence is that this ratio can differ significantly from 1 for very long periods. \n Although focusing on the balance sheet can give some useful information about a firm\u2019s \nliquidation value or its replacement cost, the analyst must usually turn to expected future cash flows for a better estimate of the firm\u2019s value as a going concern. We therefore turn to the quantitative models that analysts use to value common stock based on forecasts of future earnings and dividends.    \n   18.2 Intrinsic Value versus Market Price \n  The most popular model for assessing the value of a firm as a going concern starts from the observation that an investor in stock expects a return consisting of cash dividends and capital gains or losses. We begin by assuming a 1-year holding period and supposing that ABC stock has an expected dividend per share,  E ( D  \n1 ), of $4; the current price of a share, \n P  0 , is $48; and the expected price at the end of a year,  E ( P  1 ), is $52. For now, don\u2019t worry \nabout how you derive your forecast of next year\u2019s price. At this point we ask only whether \nthe stock seems attractively priced  today  given your forecast of  next year\u2019s  price. \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   593bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   593 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n594 PART V  Security Analysis\n The  expected  holding-period return is  E ( D  1 ) plus the expected price appreciation, \n E ( P  1 )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 P  0 , all divided by the current price,  P  0 : \n   Expected HPR 5E(r)5E(D1)13E(P1)2P04\nP0\n 541(52248)\n485.167, or 16.7%   \n Thus, the stock\u2019s expected holding-period return is the sum of the expected dividend \nyield,  E ( D  1 )/ P  0 , and the expected rate of price appreciation, the capital gains yield, \n[ E ( P  1 )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 P  0 ]/ P  0 . \n But what is the required rate of return for ABC stock? The CAPM states that when \nstock market prices are at equilibrium levels, the rate of return that investors can expect to earn on a security is  r  \n f  \u00a0 1 \u00a0 b [ E ( r   M  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  ]. Thus, the CAPM may be viewed as providing \nan estimate of the rate of return an investor can reasonably expect to earn on a security \ngiven its risk as measured by beta. This is the return that investors will require of any other investment with equivalent risk. We will denote this required rate of return as  k.  If a stock \nis priced \u201ccorrectly,\u201d it will offer investors a \u201cfair\u201d return, that is, its  expected  return will \nequal its  required  return. Of course, the goal of a security analyst is to find stocks that are \nmispriced. For example, an underpriced stock will provide an expected return greater than the required return. \n Suppose that  r  \n f  \u00a0 5 \u00a06%,\u00a0 E ( r   M  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a05%, and the beta of ABC is 1.2. Then the value \nof  k  is \n  k56%11.235%512%  \n The expected holding-period return, 16.7%, therefore exceeds the required rate of return \nbased on ABC\u2019s risk by a margin of 4.7%. Naturally, the investor will want to include more of ABC stock in the portfolio than a passive strategy would indicate. \n Another way to see this is to compare the intrinsic value of a share of stock to its market \nprice. The  intrinsic value,  denoted  V  \n0 , is defined as the present value of all cash payments \nto the investor in the stock, including dividends as well as the proceeds from the ultimate sale of the stock, discounted at the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate,  k.  If the intrinsic \nvalue, or the investor\u2019s own estimate of what the stock is really worth, exceeds the market price, the stock is considered undervalued and a good investment. For ABC, using a 1-year investment horizon and a forecast that the stock can be sold at the end of the year at price  P  \n1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$52, the intrinsic value is \n  V05E(D1)1E(P1)\n11k5$41$52\n1.125$50  \n Equivalently, at a price of $50, the investor would derive a 12% rate of return\u2014just \nequal to the required rate of return\u2014on an investment in the stock. However, at the current \nprice of $48, the stock is underpriced compared to intrinsic value. At this price, it provides better than a fair rate of return relative to its risk. Using the terminology of the CAPM, it is a positive-alpha stock, and investors will want to buy more of it than they would following a passive strategy. \n If the intrinsic value turns out to be lower than the current market price, investors should \nbuy less of it than under the passive strategy. It might even pay to go short on ABC stock, as we discussed in Chapter 3. \n In market equilibrium, the current market price will reflect the intrinsic value estimates \nof all market participants. This means the individual investor whose  V  \n0  estimate differs \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   594bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   594 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 595\nfrom the market price,  P  0 , in effect must disagree with some or all of the market consensus \nestimates of  E ( D  1 ),\u00a0 E ( P  1 ), or  k.  A common term for the market consensus value of the \nrequired rate of return,  k,  is the  market capitalization rate,  which we use often through-\nout this chapter. \n You expect the price of IBX stock to be $59.77 per share a year from now.

What are the stock\u2019s expected dividend yield, rate of price appreciation, and holding-period return?  \n    b.

What is the intrinsic value of IBX stock, and how does it compare to the current market price?    CONCEPT CHECK 18.1 \n      18.3 Dividend Discount Models \n  Consider an investor who buys a share of Steady State Electronics stock, planning to hold \nit for 1 year. The intrinsic value of the share is the present value of the dividend to be received at the end of the first year,  D  \n1 , and the expected sales price,  P  1 . We will henceforth \nuse the simpler notation  P  1  instead of  E ( P  1 ) to avoid clutter. Keep in mind, though, that \nfuture prices and dividends are unknown, and we are dealing with expected values, not certain values. We\u2019ve already established \n   V\n05D11P1\n11k  (18.1)   \n Although this year\u2019s dividends are fairly predictable given a company\u2019s history, you \nmight ask how we can estimate  P  1 , the year-end price. According to Equation 18.1,  V  1  (the \nyear-end intrinsic value) will be \n  V15D21P2\n11k  \n If we assume the stock will be selling for its intrinsic value next year, then  V  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 P  1 , and we \ncan substitute this value for  P  1  into Equation 18.1 to find \n  V05D1\n11k1D21P2\n(11k)2  \n This equation may be interpreted as the present value of dividends plus sales price \nfor a 2-year holding period. Of course, now we need to come up with a forecast of  P  2 . \nContinuing in the same way, we can replace  P  2  by ( D  3 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 P  3 )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 k ), which relates  P  0  to \nthe value of dividends plus the expected sales price for a 3-year holding period. \n More generally, for a holding period of  H  years, we can write the stock value as the \npresent value of dividends over the  H  years, plus the ultimate sale price,  P   H  : \n   V05D1\n11k1D2\n(11k)21c1DH1PH\n(11k)H  (18.2)   \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   595bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   595 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n596 PART V  Security Analysis\n Note the similarity between this formula and the bond valuation formula developed \nin Chapter 14. Each relates price to the present value of a stream of payments (coupons \nin the case of bonds, dividends in the case of stocks) and a final payment (the face value of the bond, or the sales price of the stock). The key differences in the case of stocks are the uncertainty of dividends, the lack of a fixed maturity date, and the unknown sales price at the horizon date. Indeed, one can continue to substitute for price indefinitely, to conclude \n   V\n05D1\n11k1D2\n(11k)21D3\n(11k)31c  (18.3)   \n Equation 18.3 states that the stock price should equal the present value of all expected \nfuture dividends into perpetuity. This formula is called the  dividend discount model \n(DDM)  of stock prices. \n It is tempting, but incorrect, to conclude from Equation 18.3 that the DDM focuses \nexclusively on dividends and ignores capital gains as a motive for investing in stock. Indeed, \nwe assume explicitly in Equation 18.1 that capital gains (as reflected in the expected sales price,  P  \n1 ) are part of the stock\u2019s value. Our point is that the price at which you can sell a \nstock in the future depends on dividend forecasts at that time. \n The reason only dividends appear in Equation 18.3 is not that investors ignore capital \ngains. It is instead that those capital gains will reflect dividend forecasts at the time the stock is sold. That is why in Equation 18.2 we can write the stock price as the present value of dividends plus sales price for  any  horizon date.  P  \n H   is the present value at time  H  of all \ndividends expected to be paid after the horizon date. That value is then discounted back \nto today, time 0. The DDM asserts that stock prices are determined ultimately by the cash flows accruing to stockholders, and those are dividends.  \n1     \n   The Constant-Growth DDM \n Equation 18.3 as it stands is still not very useful in valuing a stock because it requires dividend forecasts for every year into the indefinite future. To make the DDM practical, we need to introduce some simplifying assumptions. A useful and common first pass at the problem is to assume that dividends are trending upward at a stable growth rate that we will call  g.  For example, if  g \u00a0 5 \u00a0.05, and the most recently paid dividend was  D  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a03.81, \nexpected future dividends are \n   D15D0(11g) 53.8131.05   54.00\n D25D0(11g)253.813(1.05)254.20\n D35D0(11g)353.813(1.05)354.41  \n and so on. Using these dividend forecasts in Equation 18.3, we solve for intrinsic value as \n  V\n05D0(11g)\n11k1D0(11g)2\n(11k)21D0(11g)3\n(11k)31c  \n  1 If investors never expected a dividend to be paid, then this model implies that the stock would have no value. To \nreconcile the DDM with the fact that non-dividend-paying stocks do have a market value, one must assume that \ninvestors expect that some day it may pay out some cash, even if only a liquidating dividend. \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   596bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   596 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 597\n This equation can be simplified to  2    \n   V05D0(11g)\nk2g5D1\nk2g  (18.4)   \n Note in Equation 18.4 that we divide  D  1  (not  D  0 ) by  k \u00a0 2 \u00a0 g  to calculate intrinsic value. If \nthe market capitalization rate for Steady State is 12%, we can use Equation 18.4 to show \nthat the intrinsic value of a share of Steady State stock is \n  $3.81 (11.05)\n.122.055$4.00\n.122.055$57.14  \n Equation 18.4 is called the  constant-growth DDM,  or the Gordon model, after Myron \nJ. Gordon, who popularized the model. It should remind you of the formula for the pres-ent value of a perpetuity. If dividends were expected not to grow, then the dividend stream would be a simple perpetuity, and the valuation formula would be  \n3    V  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 D  1 / k.  Equation \n18.4 is a generalization of the perpetuity formula to cover the case of a  growing  perpetuity. \nAs  g  increases (for a given value of  D  1 ), the stock price also rises.  \n  2 We prove that the intrinsic value,  V  0 , of a stream of cash dividends growing at a constant rate  g  is equal to    D1\nk2g  \nas follows. By definition, \n   V05D1\n11k1D1(11g)\n(11k)21D1(11g)2\n(11k)31c  (a)   \n Multiplying through by (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 k )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 g ), we obtain \n   (11k)\n(11g) V05D1\n(11g)1D1\n(11k)1D1(11g)\n(11k)21c  (b)   \n Subtracting equation (a) from equation (b), we find that \n  11k\n11g V02V05D1\n(11g)  \n which implies \n   (k2g)V0\n(11g)5D1\n(11g)\n V05D1\nk2g  \n   3 Recall from introductory finance that the present value of a $1 per year perpetuity is 1/ k.  For example, if \n k \u00a0 5 \u00a010%, the value of the perpetuity is $1/.10\u00a0 5 \u00a0$10. Notice that if  g \u00a0 5 \u00a00 in Equation 18.4, the constant-growth \nDDM formula is the same as the perpetuity formula.   Preferred stock that pays a fixed dividend can be valued using the constant-growth divi-\ndend discount model. The constant-growth rate of dividends is simply zero. For example, to value a preferred stock paying a fixed dividend of $2 per share when the discount rate is 8%, we compute \n  V\n05$2\n.08205$25   Example 18.1 Preferred Stock and the DDM \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   597bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   597 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n598 PART V  Security Analysis\n   The constant-growth DDM is valid only when  g  is less than  k.  If dividends were \nexpected to grow forever at a rate faster than  k,  the value of the stock would be infinite. If \nan analyst derives an estimate of  g  greater than  k,  that growth rate must be unsustainable in \nthe long run. The appropriate valuation model to use in this case is a multistage DDM such \nas those discussed below. \n The constant-growth DDM is so widely used by stock market analysts that it is worth \nexploring some of its implications and limitations. The constant-growth rate DDM implies that a stock\u2019s value will be greater:\n    1. The larger its expected dividend per share.  \n   2. The lower the market capitalization rate,  k.   \n   3. The higher the expected growth rate of dividends.    \n Another implication of the constant-growth model is that the stock price is expected to \ngrow at the same rate as dividends. To see this, suppose Steady State stock is selling at its \nintrinsic value of $57.14, so that  V  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 P  0 . Then \n  P05D1\nk2g  \n Note that price is proportional to dividends. Therefore, next year, when the dividends \npaid to Steady State stockholders are expected to be higher by  g \u00a0 5 \u00a05%, price also should \nincrease by 5%. To confirm this, note \n   D25$4(1.05)5$4.20\n P15D2\nk2g5$4.20\n.122.055$60.00  \n which is 5% higher than the current price of $57.14. To generalize, \n  P15D2\nk2g5D1(11g)\nk2g5D1\nk2g (11g)5P0(11g)  \n Therefore, the DDM implies that in the case of constant growth of dividends, the \nrate of price appreciation in any year will equal that constant-growth rate,  g.  For a stock  High Flyer Industries has just paid its annual dividend of $3 per share. The dividend is \nexpected to grow at a constant rate of 8% indefinitely. The beta of High Flyer stock is 1.0, the risk-free rate is 6%, and the market risk premium is 8%. What is the intrinsic value of the stock? What would be your estimate of intrinsic value if you believed that the stock was riskier, with a beta of 1.25? \n Because a $3 dividend has just been paid and the growth rate of dividends is 8%, \nthe forecast for the year-end dividend is $3\u00a0 3 \u00a01.08\u00a0 5 \u00a0$3.24. The market capitalization \nrate (using the CAPM) is 6%\u00a0 1 \u00a01.0\u00a0 3 \u00a08%\u00a0 5 \u00a014%. Therefore, the value of the stock is \n  V\n05D1\nk2g5$3.24\n.142.085$54  \n If the stock is perceived to be riskier, its value must be lower.

By \nobserving the dividend yield,  D  1 / P  0 , and estimating the growth rate of dividends, we can \ncompute  k.  This equation is also known as the  discounted cash flow (DCF) formula.  \n This approach is often used in rate hearings for regulated public utilities. The regulatory \nagency responsible for approving utility pricing decisions is mandated to allow the firms to charge just enough to cover costs plus a \u201cfair\u201d profit, that is, one that allows a competitive return on the investment the firm has made in its productive capacity. In turn, that return is taken to be the expected return investors require on the stock of the firm. The  D  \n1 / P  0 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 g  \nformula provides a means to infer that required return.    \n Suppose that Steady State Electronics wins a major contract for its new computer chip. \nThe very profitable contract will enable it to increase the growth rate of dividends from 5% to 6% without reducing the current dividend from the projected value of $4.00 per share. What will happen to the stock price? What will happen to future expected rates of return on the stock? \n The stock price ought to increase in response to the good news about the contract, \nand indeed it does. The stock price jumps from its original value of $57.14 to a post-\nannouncement price of \n  D\n1\nk2g5$4.00\n.122.065$66.67  \n Investors who are holding the stock when the good news about the contract is \nannounced will receive a substantial windfall. \n On the other hand, at the new price the expected rate of return on the stock is 12%, \njust as it was before the new contract was announced. \n  E(r)5D1\nP01g5$4.00\n$66.671.065.12, or 12%   \n This result makes sense. Once the news about the contract is reflected in the stock price, \nthe expected rate of return will be consistent with the risk of the stock. Because the risk of the stock has not changed, neither should the expected rate of return.  Example 18.3 The Constant-Growth Model \n     a.  IBX\u2019s stock dividend at the end of this year is expected to be $2.15, and it is expected to grow at 11.2% per year forever.

If IBX\u2019s current market price is equal to this intrinsic value, what is next year\u2019s expected price?  \n    c.

In this case the expected rate of price appreciation depends on an additional assumption about whether the discrepancy between the intrinsic value and the market price will disappear, and if so, when. \n One fairly common assumption is that the discrepancy will never disappear and that the \nmarket price will trend upward at rate  g  forever. This implies that the discrepancy between \nintrinsic value and market price also will grow at the same rate. In our example: \n  Now    Next Year  \n  V  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$50   V  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$50\u00a0 3 \u00a01.04\u00a0 5 \u00a0$52 \n    P  0  \u00a0   5  \u00a0$48      P  1  \u00a0   5  \u00a0$48\u00a0  3  \u00a01.04\u00a0  5  \u00a0$49.92  \n  V  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2   V  1 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2\u00a0 3 \u00a01.04\u00a0 5 \u00a0$2.08 \n Under this assumption the expected HPR will exceed the required rate, because the \ndividend yield is higher than it would be if  P  0  were equal to  V  0 . In our example the divi-\ndend yield would be 8.33% instead of 8%, so that the expected HPR would be 12.33% \nrather than 12%: \n  E(r)5D1\nP01g5$4\n$481.045.08331.045.1233  \n An investor who identifies this undervalued stock can get an expected dividend that \nexceeds the required yield by 33 basis points. This excess return is earned  each year,  and \nthe market price never catches up to intrinsic value. \n An alternative assumption is that the gap between market price and intrinsic value will \ndisappear by the end of the year. In that case we would have  P  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 V  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$52, and \n  E(r)5D1\nP01P12P0\nP054\n48152248\n485.08331.08335.1667  \n The assumption of complete catch-up to intrinsic value produces a much larger 1-year HPR. In future years, however, the stock is expected to generate only fair rates of return. \n Many stock analysts assume that a stock\u2019s price will approach its intrinsic value gradu-\nally over time\u2014for example, over a 5-year period. This puts their expected 1-year HPR somewhere between the bounds of 12.33% and 16.67%.  \n  Stock Prices and Investment Opportunities \n Consider two companies, Cash Cow, Inc., and Growth Prospects, each with expected earn-ings in the coming year of $5 per share. Both companies could in principle pay out all of these earnings as dividends, maintaining a perpetual dividend flow of $5 per share. If the market capitalization rate were  k \u00a0 5 \u00a012.5%, both companies would then be valued at \n D  \n1 / k \u00a0 5 \u00a0$5/.125\u00a0 5 \u00a0$40 per share. Neither firm would grow in value, because with all earn-\nings paid out as dividends, and no earnings reinvested in the firm, both companies\u2019 capital \nstock and earnings capacity would remain unchanged over time; earnings  4   and dividends \nwould not grow.  \n  4 Actually, we are referring here to earnings net of the funds necessary to maintain the productivity of the firm\u2019s \ncapital, that is, earnings net of \u201ceconomic depreciation.\u201d In other words, the earnings figure should be interpreted \nas the maximum amount of money the firm could pay out each year in perpetuity without depleting its productive capacity. For this reason, the net earnings number may be quite different from the accounting earnings figure that the firm reports in its financial statements. We explore this further in the next chapter. \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   600bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   600 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 601\n Now suppose one of the firms, Growth Prospects, \nengages in projects that generate a return on invest-\nment of 15%, which is greater than the required rate \nof return,  k \u00a0 5 \u00a012.5%. It would be foolish for such a \ncompany to pay out all of its earnings as dividends. \nIf Growth Prospects retains or plows back some of \nits earnings into its profitable projects, it can earn a \n15% rate of return for its shareholders, whereas if \nit pays out all earnings as dividends, it forgoes the \nprojects, leaving shareholders to invest the dividends \nin other opportunities at a fair market rate of only \n12.5%. Suppose, therefore, that Growth Prospects \nchooses a lower  dividend payout ratio   (the fraction \nof earnings paid out as dividends), reducing payout \nfrom 100% to 40%, maintaining a  plowback ratio   \n(the fraction of earnings reinvested in the firm) at \n60%. The plowback ratio is also referred to as the \n earnings retention ratio.   \n The dividend of the company, therefore, will be $2 (40% of $5 earnings) instead of $5. \nWill share price fall? No\u2014it will rise! Although dividends initially fall under the earn-\nings reinvestment policy, subsequent growth in the assets of the firm because of rein-\nvested profits will generate growth in future dividends, which will be reflected in today\u2019s \nshare price. \n  Figure\u00a018.1  illustrates the dividend streams generated by Growth Prospects under two \ndividend policies. A low-reinvestment-rate plan allows the firm to pay higher initial divi-\ndends, but results in a lower dividend growth rate. Eventually, a high-reinvestment-rate \nplan will provide higher dividends. If the dividend growth generated by the reinvested \nearnings is high enough, the stock will be worth more under the high-reinvestment \nstrategy.  \n How much growth will be generated? Suppose Growth Prospects starts with plant and \nequipment of $100 million and is all equity financed. With a return on investment or equity \n(ROE) of 15%, total earnings are ROE\u00a0 3 \u00a0$100\u00a0million\u00a0 5 \u00a0.15\u00a0 3 \u00a0$100\u00a0million\u00a0 5 \u00a0$15\u00a0mil lion. \nThere are 3 million shares of stock outstanding, so earnings per share are $5, as posited \nabove. If 60% of the $15 million in this year\u2019s earnings is reinvested, then the value of the \nfirm\u2019s assets will increase by .60\u00a0 3 \u00a0$15\u00a0million\u00a0 5 \u00a0$9\u00a0million, or by 9%. The percentage \nincrease in assets is the rate at which income was generated (ROE) times the plowback \nratio (the fraction of earnings reinvested in the firm), which we will denote as  b.  \n Now endowed with 9% more assets, the company earns 9% more income, and pays out \n9% higher dividends. The growth rate of the dividends, therefore, is  5    \n  g5ROE3b5.153.605.09  \n If the stock price equals its intrinsic value, it should sell at \n  P05D1\nk2g5$2\n.1252.095$57.14   \nDividends per Share ($)\nYear12\n03 0 20 10Low ReinvestmentHigh Reinvestment\n0246810\n Figure 18.1 Dividend growth for two earnings \nreinvestment policies  \n5 We can derive this relationship more generally by noting that with a fixed ROE, earnings (which equal \nROE\u00a0 3 \u00a0book value) will grow at the same rate as the book value of the firm.

Therefore, you can think of $40 as the value per \nshare of the assets the company already has in place. \n When Growth Prospects decided to reduce current dividends and reinvest some of its \nearnings in new investments, its stock price increased. The increase in the stock price reflects the fact that the planned investments provide an expected rate of return greater than the required rate. In other words, the investment opportunities have positive net present value. The value of the firm rises by the NPV of these investment opportunities. This net present value is also called the  present value of growth opportunities,  or  PVGO.  \n Therefore, we can think of the value of the firm as the sum of the value of assets already \nin place, or the no-growth value of the firm, plus the net present value of the future invest-ments the firm will make, which is the PVGO. For Growth Prospects, PVGO\u00a0 5 \u00a0$17.14 per \nshare: \n    P r i c e5No-\ngrowth value per share 1PVGO \n  P05E1\nk1PVGO  \n  57.14540117.14   (18.6)   \n We know that in reality, dividend cuts almost always are accompanied by steep drops \nin stock prices. Does this contradict our analysis? Not necessarily: Dividend cuts are usu-\nally taken as bad news about the future prospects of the firm, and it is the  new information  \nabout the firm\u2014not the reduced dividend yield per se\u2014that is responsible for the stock price decline. \n For example, when J.P. Morgan cut its quarterly dividend from 38 cents to 5 cents a \nshare in 2009, its stock price actually increased by about 5%. The company was able to convince investors that the cut would conserve cash and prepare the firm to weather a severe recession. When investors were convinced that the dividend cut made sense, the stock price actually increased. Similarly, when BP announced in the wake of the massive 2010 Gulf oil spill that it would suspend dividends for the rest of the year, its stock price did not budge. The cut already had been widely anticipated, so it was not new information. These examples show that stock price declines in response to dividend cuts are really a response to the information conveyed by the cut. \n It is important to recognize that growth per se is not what investors desire. Growth \nenhances company value only if it is achieved by investment in projects with attractive profit opportunities (i.e., with ROE\u00a0 .\u00a0 k ). To see why, let\u2019s now consider Growth Prospects\u2019s \nunfortunate sister company, Cash Cow, Inc. Cash Cow\u2019s ROE is only 12.5%, just equal to the required rate of return,  k.  The net present value of its investment opportunities is zero. \nWe\u2019ve seen that following a zero-growth strategy with  b \u00a0 5 \u00a00 and  g \u00a0 5 \u00a00, the value of Cash \nCow will be  E  \n1 / k \u00a0 5 \u00a0$5/.125\u00a0 5 \u00a0$40 per share. Now suppose Cash Cow chooses a plowback \nratio of  b \u00a0 5 \u00a0.60, the same as Growth Prospects\u2019s plowback. Then  g  would increase to \n  g5ROE3b5.1253.605.075  \n but the stock price is still $40: \n  P05D1\nk2g5$2\n.1252.0755$40  \n which is no different from the no-growth strategy. \n In the case of Cash Cow, the dividend reduction used to free funds for reinvest-\nment in the firm generates only enough growth to maintain the stock price at the cur-rent level. This is as it should be: If the firm\u2019s projects yield only what investors can \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   602bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   602 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 603\nearn on their own, shareholders cannot be made better off by a high-reinvestment-rate \npolicy. This demonstrates that \u201cgrowth\u201d is not the same as growth opportunities. To jus-tify reinvestment, the firm must engage in projects with better prospective returns than those shareholders can find elsewhere. Notice also that the PVGO of Cash Cow is zero: PVGO\u00a0 5 \u00a0 P  \n0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 E  1 / k \u00a0 5 \u00a040\u00a0 2 \u00a040\u00a0 5 \u00a00. With ROE\u00a0 5 \u00a0 k,  there is no advantage to plowing \nfunds back into the firm; this shows up as PVGO of zero. In fact, this is why firms with considerable cash flow but limited investment prospects are called \u201ccash cows.\u201d The cash these firms generate is best taken out of, or \u201cmilked from,\u201d the firm. \n     a.  Calculate the price of a firm with a plowback ratio of .60 if its ROE is 20%. Current earnings,  E  1 , will be \n$5 per share, and  k \u00a0 5 \u00a012.5%.  \n    b.  What if ROE is 10%, which is less than the market capitalization rate? Compare the firm\u2019s price in this \ninstance to that of a firm with the same ROE and  E  1 , but a plowback ratio of  b \u00a0 5 \u00a00.    CONCEPT CHECK 18.3 \n     Life Cycles and Multistage Growth Models \n As useful as the constant-growth DDM formula is, you need to remember that it is based \non a simplifying assumption, namely, that the dividend growth rate will be constant for-ever. In fact, firms typically pass through life cycles with very different dividend profiles in  Takeover Target is run by entrenched management that insists on reinvesting 60% of its \nearnings in projects that provide an ROE of 10%, despite the fact that the firm\u2019s capi-talization rate is  k \u00a0 5 \u00a015%. The firm\u2019s year-end dividend will be $2 per share, paid out \nof earnings of $5 per share. At what price will the stock sell? What is the present value of growth opportunities? Why would such a firm be a takeover target for another firm? \n Given current management\u2019s investment policy, the dividend growth rate will be \n  \ng5ROE3b510%3.6056%  \n and the stock price should be \n  P05$2\n.152.065$22.22  \n The present value of growth opportunities is \n   PVGO5Price per s hare2No-growth value per s hare\n 5$22.222E1/k5$22.222$5/.1552$11.11  \n PVGO is  negative.  This is because the net present value of the firm\u2019s projects is negative: \nThe rate of return on those assets is less than the opportunity cost of capital. \n Such a firm would be subject to takeover, because another firm could buy the \nfirm for the market price of $22.22 per share and increase the value of the firm by \nchanging its investment policy. For example, if the new management simply paid out all earnings as dividends, the value of the firm would increase to its no-growth value,  E  \n1 / k \u00a0 5 \u00a0$5/.15\u00a0 5 \u00a0$33.33.

In early years, there are ample opportunities for profitable reinvestment in \nthe company. Payout ratios are low, and growth is correspondingly rapid. In later years, the \nfirm matures, production capacity is sufficient to meet market demand, competitors enter \nthe market, and attractive opportunities for reinvestment may become harder to find. In this \nmature phase, the firm may choose to increase the dividend payout ratio, rather than retain \nearnings. The dividend level increases, but thereafter it grows at a slower rate because the \ncompany has fewer growth opportunities. \n  Table\u00a018.2  illustrates this pattern. It gives Value Line\u2019s forecasts of return on capital, \ndividend payout ratio, and 3-year projected growth rate in earnings per share for a sample \nof the firms included in the computer software industry versus those of East Coast electric \nutilities. (We compare return on capital rather than return on equity because the latter is \naffected by leverage, which tends to be far greater in the electric utility industry than in the \nsoftware industry. Return on capital measures operating income per dollar of total long-\nterm financing, regardless of whether the source of the capital supplied is debt or equity. \nWe will return to this issue in the next chapter.)  \n By and large, the software firms have attractive investment opportunities. The median \nreturn on capital of these firms is forecast to be 16.5%, and the firms have responded with \nhigh plowback ratios. Most of these firms pay no dividends at all. The high return on capi-\ntal and high plowback result in rapid growth. The median projected growth rate of earnings \nper share in this group is 13.2%. \n Table 18.2 \n Financial ratios in \ntwo industries     Ticker    Return on \nCapital (%)    Payout \nRatio (%)    Growth Rate \n2014\u20132016  \n  Computer Software  \n Adobe Systems  ADBE  12.0 % 0.0 % 13.2% \n Cognizant  CTSH  18.5  0.0  20.5 \n Compuware  CPWR  13.5  0.0  16.6 \n Intuit  INTU  20.0  22.0  10.9 \n Microsoft  MSFT  31.5  34.0  11.7 \n Oracle  ORCL  20.5  12.0  7.0 \n Red Hat  RHT  13.0  0.0  18.2 \n Parametric Tech  PMTC  15.0  0.0  16.0 \n SAP  SAP   16.5    28.0    9.1  \n    Median   16.5 % 0.0%  13.2% \n  Electric Utilities (East Coast)  \n Central Hudson G&E  CHG  6.0 % 66.0 % 2.0% \n Consolidated Edison  ED  6.5  58.0  2.9 \n Duke Energy  DUK  5.5  66.0  4.0 \n Northeast Utilities  NU  6.0  53.0  7.7 \n Pennsylvania Power  PPL  7.0  58.0  7.7 \n Public Service Enterprise  PEG  7.5  53.0  6.3 \n South Carolina E & G  SCG  6.0  57.0  3.8 \n Southern Company  SO  7.0  69.0  5.1 \n Tampa Electric  TE  7.5  59.0  8.3 \n United Illuminating  UIL   6.0    71.0    2.1  \n    Median   6.3 % 58.5 % 4.5% \n Source:  Value Line Investment Survey,   July and August, 2012.

Their median \nreturn on capital is lower, 6.3%; dividend payout is higher, 58.5%; and median growth is \nlower, 4.5%. We conclude that the higher payouts of the electric utilities reflect their more limited opportunities to reinvest earnings at attractive rates of return. \n To value companies with temporarily high growth, analysts use a multistage version of \nthe dividend discount model. Dividends in the early high-growth period are forecast and their combined present value is calculated. Then, once the firm is projected to settle down to a steady-growth phase, the constant-growth DDM is applied to value the remaining stream of dividends. \n We can illustrate this with a real-life example.  Figure\u00a018.2  is a Value Line Investment \nSurvey report on Honda Motor Co. Some of the relevant information for 2012 is highlighted.  \n Honda\u2019s beta appears at the circled A, its recent stock price at the B, the per-share \ndividend payments at the C, the ROE (referred to as  return on shareholder equity ) at the \nD, and the dividend payout ratio (referred to as  all dividends to net profits ) at the E.  \n6   The \nrows ending at C, D, and E are historical time series. The boldfaced, italicized entries under 2013 are estimates for that year. Similarly, the entries in the far right column (labeled 15\u201317) are forecasts for some time between 2015\u20132017, which we will take to be 2016.\n  \n Value Line projects fairly rapid growth in the near term, with dividends rising from $.78 \nin 2013 to $1.00 in 2016. This growth rate cannot be sustained indefinitely. We can obtain dividend inputs for this initial period by using the explicit forecasts for 2013 and 2016 and linear interpolation for the years between:   \n   2013       $.78     2015       $ .92  \n  2014       $.85     2016       $1.00   \n Now let us assume the dividend growth rate levels off in 2016. What is a good guess for \nthat steady-state growth rate? Value Line forecasts a dividend payout ratio of .25 and an ROE of 10%, implying long-term growth will be \n  \ng5ROE3b510.0%3(12.25)57.5%  \n Our estimate of Honda\u2019s intrinsic value using an investment horizon of 2016 is therefore obtained from Equation 18.2, which we restate here: \n   V\n20125D2013\n11k1D2014\n(11k)21D2015\n(11k)31D20161P2016\n(11k)4\n 5.78\n11k1.85\n(11k)21.92\n(11k)311.001P2016\n(11k)4  \n Here,  P  2016  represents the forecast price at which we can sell our shares at the end of 2016, \nwhen dividends are assumed to enter their constant-growth phase.

ADRs are not shares of the firm, but are  claims  to shares of the underlying foreign stock that are then \ntraded in U.S. security markets. Value Line notes that each Honda ADR is a claim on one common share, but in \nother cases, each ADR may represent a claim to multiple shares or even fractional shares. \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   605bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   605 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 0 6 PART V  Security Analysis\nB\nA\nC\nD\nE\n Figure 18.2 Value Line Investment Survey report on Honda Motor Co. \n  Source: Jason A.

One way to obtain  k  is from the CAPM. Observe from the Value Line report that \nHonda\u2019s beta is .95. The risk-free rate on long-term Treasury bonds in 2012 was about \n2.0%.  7   Suppose that the market risk premium were forecast at 8%, roughly in line with its \nhistorical average. This would imply that the forecast for the market return was  \n  Risk-free rate 1Market risk premium 52%18%510%  \n Therefore, we can solve for the market capitalization rate as \n  k5rf1b3E(rM)2rf452%1.95(10%22%)59.6%  \n Our forecast for the stock price in 2016 is thus \n  P20165$1.0031.075\n.0962.0755$51.19  \n and today\u2019s estimate of intrinsic value is \n  V20125.78\n1.0961.85\n(1.096 )21.92\n(1.096 )311.00151.19\n(1.096 )45$38.29  \n We know from the Value Line report that Honda\u2019s actual price was $32.88 (at the cir-cled B). Our intrinsic value analysis indicates that the stock was underpriced. Should we increase our holdings? \n Perhaps. But before betting the farm, stop to consider how firm our estimate is. We\u2019ve \nhad to guess at dividends in the near future, the ultimate growth rate of those dividends, and the appropriate discount rate. Moreover, we\u2019ve assumed Honda will follow a relatively simple two-stage growth process. In practice, the growth of dividends can follow more complicated patterns. Even small errors in these approximations could upset a conclusion. \n For example, suppose that we have overestimated Honda\u2019s growth prospects and that \nthe actual ROE in the post-2016 period will be 9% rather than 10%. Using the lower return on equity in the dividend discount model would result in an intrinsic value in 2012 of only $28.77, which is  less  than the stock price. Our conclusion regarding intrinsic value versus \nprice is reversed. \n The exercise also highlights the importance of performing sensitivity analysis when \nyou attempt to value stocks. Your estimates of stock values are no better than your assump-tions. Sensitivity analysis will highlight the inputs that need to be most carefully exam-ined. For example, even modest changes in the estimated ROE for the post-2016 period can result in big changes in intrinsic value. Similarly, small changes in the assumed capi-talization rate would change intrinsic value substantially. On the other hand, reasonable changes in the dividends forecast between 2013 and 2016 would have a small impact on intrinsic value. \n Confirm that the intrinsic value of Honda using ROE\u00a0 5 \u00a09% is $28.77.

Multistage growth models allow dividends per share to grow \nat several different rates as the firm matures. Many analysts use three-stage growth mod-\nels. They may assume an initial period of high dividend growth (or instead make year-\nby-year forecasts of dividends for the short term), a final period of sustainable growth, \nand a transition period between, during which dividend growth rates taper off from \nthe initial rapid rate to the ultimate sustainable rate. These models are conceptually no \nharder to work with than a two-stage model, but they require many more calculations \nand can be tedious to do by hand. It is easy, however, to build an Excel spreadsheet for \nsuch a model. \n Spreadsheet 18.1 is an example of such a model. Column B contains the inputs we have \nused so far for Honda. Column E contains dividend forecasts. In cells E2 through E5 we \npresent the Value Line estimates for the next 4 years. Dividend growth in this period is \nabout 8.6% annually. Rather than assume a sudden transition to constant dividend growth \nstarting in 2016, we assume instead that the dividend growth rate in 2016 will be 8.6% and \nthat it will decline steadily through 2027, finally reaching the constant terminal growth rate \nof 7.5% (see column F). Each dividend in the transition period is the previous year\u2019s divi-\ndend times that year\u2019s growth rate. Terminal value once the firm enters a constant-growth \nstage (cell G17) is computed from the constant-growth DDM. Finally, investor cash flow \nin each period (column H) equals dividends in each year plus the terminal value in 2027. \nThe present value of these cash flows is computed in cell H19 as $40.29, about 5% higher \nthan the value we found from the two-stage model. We obtain a greater intrinsic value in \nthis case because we assume that dividend growth only gradually declines to its steady-\nstate value.     \n Spreadsheet 18.1\nA three-stage growth model for Honda  Motor Co.   eXcel\nPlease visit us at \nwww.mhhe.com/bkmABCDE FG H I\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21Inputs\nbeta\nmkt_prem\nrf\nk_equity\nplowback\nroe\nterm_gwth\nValue line\nannual dividendsforecasts of\nTransitional period\nwith slowing dividend\ngrowth\nBeginning of constant\ngrowth period0.95\n0.08\n0.02\n0.0960\n0.75\n0.1\n0.075Year\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027Dividend Div growth Term value Investor CF\n0.78\n0.85\n0.92\n1.00\n1.09\n1.18\n1.28\n1.38\n1.50\n1.62\n1.75\n1.88\n2.03\n2.18\n2.35\n2.520.0863\n0.0852\n0.0841\n0.0829\n0.0818\n0.0807\n0.0795\n0.0784\n0.0773\n0.0761\n0.0750\n0.0750 129.180.78\n0.85\n0.92\n1.00\n1.09\n1.18\n1.28\n1.38\n1.50\n1.62\n1.75\n1.88\n2.03\n2.18\n2.35\n131.71\nE17*(1 +F17)/(B5 \u2212F17)40.29\nNPV(B5,H2:H17)= PV of CF\nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   608bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   608 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 609\n   18.4 Price\u2013Earnings Ratio \n   The Price\u2013Earnings Ratio and Growth Opportunities \n Much of the real-world discussion of stock market valuation concentrates on the firm\u2019s \n price\u2013earnings multiple,  the ratio of price per share to earnings per share, commonly \ncalled the P/E ratio. Our discussion of growth opportunities shows why stock market ana-lysts focus on the P/E ratio. Both companies considered, Cash Cow and Growth Prospects, had earnings per share (EPS) of $5, but Growth Prospects reinvested 60% of earnings in prospects with an ROE of 15%, whereas Cash Cow paid out all earnings as dividends. Cash Cow had a price of $40, giving it a P/E multiple of 40/5\u00a0 5 \u00a08.0, whereas Growth Pros-\npects sold for $57.14, giving it a multiple of 57.14/5\u00a0 5 \u00a011.4. This observation suggests the \nP/E ratio might serve as a useful indicator of expectations of growth opportunities. \n We can see how growth opportunities are reflected in P/E ratios by rearranging \nEquation 18.6 to \n   P\n0\nE151\nk \u00a211PVGO\nE/k\u2264  (18.7)   \n When PVGO\u00a0 5 \u00a00, Equation 18.7 shows that  P  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E  1 / k.  The stock is valued like a non-\ngrowing perpetuity of  E  1 , and the P/E ratio is just 1/ k.  However, as PVGO becomes an \nincreasingly dominant contributor to price, the P/E ratio can rise dramatically. \n The ratio of PVGO to  E / k  has a straightforward interpretation. It is the ratio of the \ncomponent of firm value due to growth opportunities to the component of value due to \nassets already in place (i.e., the no-growth value of the firm,  E / k ). When future growth \nopportunities dominate the estimate of total value, the firm will command a high price relative to current earnings. Thus a high P/E multiple indicates that a firm enjoys ample growth opportunities. \n P/E multiples do vary with growth prospects. Between 1996 and 2012, for example, \nFedEx\u2019s P/E ratio averaged about 17.4 while Consolidated Edison\u2019s (an electric utility) average P/E was only 15.7. These numbers do not necessarily imply that FedEx was over-priced compared to Con Ed. If investors believed FedEx would grow faster than Con Ed, the higher price per dollar of earnings would be justified. That is, an investor might well pay a higher price per dollar of  current  earnings if he or she expects that earnings stream \nto grow more rapidly. In fact, FedEx\u2019s growth rate has been consistent with its higher P/E multiple. Over this period, its earnings per share grew at 10.2% per year while Con Ed\u2019s earnings growth rate was only 1.6%.  Figure\u00a018.4  on page 615 shows the EPS history of the two companies. \n We conclude that the P/E ratio reflects the market\u2019s optimism concerning a firm\u2019s \ngrowth prospects. Analysts must decide whether they are more or less optimistic than the belief implied by the market multiple. If they are more optimistic, they will recommend buying the stock. \n There is a way to make these insights more precise. Look again at the constant-growth \nDDM formula,  P  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 D  1 /( k \u00a0 2 \u00a0 g ). Now recall that dividends equal the earnings that are  not  \nreinvested in the firm:  D  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E  1 (1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 b ). Recall also that  g \u00a0 5 \u00a0ROE\u00a0 3 \u00a0 b.   Hence, substituting \nfor  D  1  and  g,  we find that \n  P05E1(12b)\nk2ROE3b  \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   609bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   609 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 1 0 PART V  Security Analysis\n implying the P/E ratio is \nP0\nE1512b\nk2ROE3b  (18.8)   \n It is easy to verify that the P/E ratio increases with ROE. This makes sense, because high-\nROE projects give the firm good opportunities for growth.  8   We also can verify that the P/E \nratio increases for higher plowback,  b,  as long as ROE exceeds  k.  This too makes sense. \nWhen a firm has good investment opportunities, the market will reward it with a higher \nP/E multiple if it exploits those opportunities more aggressively by plowing back more \nearnings into those opportunities.   \n Remember, however, that growth is not desirable for its own sake. Examine  Table\u00a018.3  \nwhere we use Equation 18.8 to compute both growth rates and P/E ratios for different com-\nbinations of ROE and  b.  Although growth always increases with the plowback rate (move \nacross the rows in panel A), the P/E ratio does not (move across the rows in panel B). In \nthe top row of panel B, the P/E falls as the plowback rate increases. In the middle row, it is \nunaffected by plowback. In the third row, it increases.  \n This pattern has a simple interpretation. When the expected ROE is less than the \nrequired return,  k,  investors prefer that the firm pay out earnings as dividends rather than \nreinvest earnings in the firm at an inadequate rate of return. That is, for ROE lower than \n k,  the value of the firm falls as plowback increases. Conversely, when ROE exceeds  k,  the \nfirm offers attractive investment opportunities, so the value of the firm is enhanced as those \nopportunities are more fully exploited by increasing the plowback rate. \n Finally, where ROE just equals  k,  the firm offers \u201cbreak-even\u201d investment opportuni-\nties with a fair rate of return. In this case, investors are indifferent between reinvestment \nof earnings in the firm or elsewhere at the market capitalization rate, because the rate of \nreturn in either case is 12%. Therefore, the stock price is unaffected by the plowback rate. \n We conclude that the higher the plowback rate, the higher the growth rate, but a higher \nplowback rate does not necessarily mean a higher P/E ratio. Higher plowback increases \nP/E only if investments undertaken by the firm offer an expected rate of return greater than \nthe market capitalization rate. Otherwise, increasing plowback hurts investors because \nmore money is sunk into projects with inadequate rates of return. \n8 Note that Equation 18.8 is a simple rearrangement of the DDM formula, with ROE\u00a0 3 \u00a0 b \u00a0 5 \u00a0 g.  Because that \nformula requires that  g \u00a0,\u00a0 k,  Equation 18.8 is valid only when ROE\u00a0 3 \u00a0 b \u00a0,\u00a0 k.  \n Table 18.3 \n Effect of ROE \nand plowback on \ngrowth and the \nP/E ratio     Plowback Rate (  b  )  \n    0    .25    .50    .75  \n  ROE    A.

In fact, a common Wall Street rule of thumb is \nthat the growth rate ought to be roughly equal to the P/E ratio. In other words, the ratio of P/E to  g,  often called the  PEG ratio,  should be about 1.0. Peter Lynch, the famous portfolio \nmanager, puts it this way in his book  One Up on Wall Street:  \n  The P/E ratio of any company that\u2019s fairly priced will equal its growth rate. I\u2019m talking \nhere about growth rate of earnings here. .\u00a0.\u00a0. If the P/E ratio of Coca Cola is 15, you\u2019d expect the company to be growing at about 15% per year, etc. But if the P/E ratio is less than the growth rate, you may have found yourself a bargain.  \n  The importance of growth opportunities is most evident in the valuation of start-up \nfirms. For example, in the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, many companies that had yet to \nturn a profit were valued by the market at billions of dollars. The perceived value of these companies was  exclusively  as growth opportunities. For example, the online auction firm \neBay had 1998 profits of $2.4 million, far less than the $45 million profit earned by the traditional auctioneer Sotheby\u2019s; yet eBay\u2019s market value was more than 10 times greater:  Let\u2019s try Lynch\u2019s rule of thumb. Assume that  \n     r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a08%     (roughly the value when Peter Lynch was writing)  \n    r   M  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a08%     (about the historical average market risk premium)  \n    b \u00a0 5 \u00a0.4     (a typical value for the plowback ratio in the United States)   \nTherefore,  r   M  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a0 1 \u00a0market risk premium\u00a0 5 \u00a08%\u00a0 1 \u00a08%\u00a0 5 \u00a016%, and  k \u00a0 5 \u00a016% for an \naverage ( b \u00a0 5 \u00a01) company. If we also accept as reasonable that ROE\u00a0 5 \u00a016% (the same \nvalue as the expected return on the stock), we conclude that \n    g5ROE3b516%3.456.4%   \n and \n   P\nE512.4\n.162.06456.26  \n Thus, the P/E ratio and  g  are about equal using these assumptions, consistent with the \nrule of thumb. \n However, note that this rule of thumb, like almost all others, will not work in all \n circumstances. For example, the yield on long-term Treasury bonds today is more like \n2%, so a comparable forecast of  r   M   today would be \n  rf1Market risk premium 52%18%510%   \n If we continue to focus on a firm with  b \u00a0 5 \u00a01, and if ROE still is about the same as  k,  then \n  g510%3.454.0%  \n while \n  P\nE512.4\n.102.04510  \n The P/E ratio and g now diverge and the PEG ratio is now 2.5. Nevertheless, lower-\nthan-average PEG ratios are still widely seen as signaling potential underpricing.

(As it turns out, the market was quite right to value eBay \nso much more aggressively than Sotheby\u2019s. Its net income in 2011 was $1.8 billion, more than 10 times that of Sotheby\u2019s. \n Of course, when company valuation is determined primarily by growth opportunities, \nthose values can be very sensitive to reassessments of such prospects. When the market became more skeptical of the business prospects of most Internet retailers at the close of the 1990s, that is, as it revised the estimates of growth opportunities downward, their stock prices plummeted. \n As perceptions of future prospects wax and wane, share price can swing wildly. Growth \nprospects are intrinsically difficult to tie down; ultimately, however, those prospects drive the value of the most dynamic firms in the economy. \n The nearby box contains a simple valuation analysis. As Facebook headed toward its \nhighly anticipated IPO in 2012, there was widespread speculation about the price at which it would eventually trade in the stock market. Notice that the discussion in the article focused on two key questions. First, what was a reasonable projection of the growth rate of Facebook\u2019s profits? Second, what multiple of earnings was appropriate to translate an earnings forecast into a price forecast? These are precisely the questions addressed by our stock valuation models. \n ABC stock has an expected ROE of 12% per year, expected earnings per share of $2, and expected divi-\ndends of $1.50 per share. Its market capitalization rate is 10% per year. \n     a.  What are its expected growth rate, its price, and its P/E ratio?  \n    b.  If the plowback ratio were .4, what would be the expected dividend per share, the growth rate, price, \nand the P/E ratio?    CONCEPT CHECK 18.5 \n    P/E Ratios and Stock Risk \n One important implication of any stock-valuation model is that (holding all else equal) \nriskier stocks will have lower P/E multiples. We can see this quite easily in the context of the constant-growth model by examining the formula for the P/E ratio (Equation 18.8): \n  P\nE512b\nk2g  \n Riskier firms will have higher required rates of return, that is, higher values of  k.  There-\nfore, the P/E multiple will be lower. This is true even outside the context of the constant-growth model. For  any  expected earnings and dividend stream, the present value of those \ncash flows will be lower when the stream is perceived to be riskier. Hence the stock price and the ratio of price to earnings will be lower. \n Of course, you can find many small, risky, start-up companies with very high P/E mul-\ntiples. This does not contradict our claim that P/E multiples should fall with risk; instead it is evidence of the market\u2019s expectations of high growth rates for those companies. This is why we said that high-risk firms will have lower P/E ratios  holding all else equal.  Given a \ngrowth projection, the P/E multiple will be lower when risk is perceived to be higher.  \n  Pitfalls in P/E Analysis \n No description of P/E analysis is complete without mentioning some of its pitfalls. First, consider that the denominator in the P/E ratio is accounting earnings, which are influenced by somewhat arbitrary accounting rules such as the use of historical cost in depreciation \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   612bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   612 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n613and inventory valuation. In times of high inflation, historic cost depreciation and inventory \ncosts will tend to underrepresent true economic values, because the replacement cost of \nboth goods and capital equipment will rise with the general level of prices. As  Figure\u00a018.3  \ndemonstrates, P/E ratios generally have been inversely related to the inflation rate. In part, \nthis reflects the market\u2019s assessment that earnings in high inflation periods are of \u201clower \nquality,\u201d artificially distorted by inflation, and warranting lower P/E ratios.  \n  Earnings management   is the practice of using flexibility in accounting rules to \nimprove the apparent profitability of the firm. We will have much to say on this topic in the \nnext chapter on interpreting financial statements. A version of earnings management that \nbecame common in the 1990s was the reporting of \u201cpro forma earnings\u201d measures. Facebook\u2019s $100 Billion Question\nWHAT IS FACEBOOK WORTH?\nAs investors dug into the company\u2019s freshly released \n financials Wednesday, analysts and investors began \n circulating a range of values\u2014from as little as $50 billion to \nas much as $125 billion\u2014for the social-networking Web site.\nIt will be months before the market sets a final price, \nbut already the valuation question has become a tug of \nwar over two essential questions: Just how fast can the \ncompany continue to grow? And can it extract value from \nadvertising in the way it plans?\nFacebook\u2019s revenue grew 88% in 2011, and net income \ngrew 65%. Facebook\u2019s growth has already decelerated from \n154% from 2009 to 2010 to the 88% it experienced last year.\nFrancis Gaskins, president of IPOdesktop.com, which \nanalyzes IPOs for investors, says he doesn\u2019t believe Face-\nbook is worth more than $50 billion\u201450 times its reported \nprofits for 2011 of $1 billion, or more than triple the mar-\nket\u2019s average price-to-earnings ratio. Google Inc.\u2019s profits \nare 10 times that of Facebook, but its stock-market value is \n$190 billion, he notes.A $100 billion valuation \u201cwould have us believe that \nFacebook is worth 53% of Google, even though Google\u2019s \nsales and profits are 10 times that of Facebook,\u201d he said.\nMartin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Denver banking bou-\ntique Wedge Partners, is more bullish, saying the value \ncould top $100 billion. He says Facebook could trade at 15 \nto 18 times next year\u2019s expected earnings before interest, \ntaxes, and certain noncash charges, a cash-flow measure \nknown as EBITDA. By comparison, he says, mature compa-\nnies trade at 8 to 10 times EBITDA. Microsoft Corp. trades \nat 7 times, and Google about 10 times.\nWhile that math only justifies an $81 billion valuation, \nhe says Facebook may be able to unlock faster growth in \nad spending and reach $5.5 billion in EBITDA, which could \njustify a higher multiple of 20 times, implying a $110 billion \nvaluation.\nSource: Randall Smith, \u201cFacebook\u2019s $100 Billion Question,\u201d The \nWall Street Journal,  February 3, 2012.

Comparisons with earlier periods probably would make more sense if those costs were excluded. \n But when there is too much leeway for choosing what to exclude, it becomes hard for \ninvestors or analysts to interpret the numbers or to compare them across firms. The lack of standards gives firms considerable leeway to manage earnings. \n Even GAAP allows firms considerable discretion to manage earnings. For example, \nin the late 1990s, Kellogg took restructuring charges, which are supposed to be one-time events, nine quarters in a row. Were these really one-time events, or were they more appro-priately treated as ordinary expenses? Given the available leeway in managing earnings, the justified P/E multiple becomes difficult to gauge. \n Another confounding factor in the use of P/E ratios is related to the business cycle. We \nwere careful in deriving the DDM to define earnings as being net of  economic  deprecia-\ntion, that is, the maximum flow of income that the firm could pay out without depleting its productive capacity. But reported earnings are computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and need not correspond to economic earnings. Beyond this, however, notions of a normal or justified P/E ratio, as in Equation 18.7 or 18.8, assume implicitly that earnings rise at a constant rate, or, put another way, on a smooth trend line. In contrast, reported earnings can fluctuate dramatically around a trend line over the course of the business cycle. \n Another way to make this point is to note that the \u201cnormal\u201d P/E ratio predicted by \nEquation 18.8 is the ratio of today\u2019s price to the  trend value  of future earnings,  E  \n1 . The \nP/E ratio reported in the financial pages of the newspaper, by contrast, is the ratio of price to the most recent  past  accounting earnings. Current accounting earnings can differ con-\nsiderably from future economic earnings. Because ownership of stock conveys the right to future as well as current earnings, the ratio of price to most recent earnings can vary sub-stantially over the business cycle, as accounting earnings and the trend value of economic earnings diverge by greater and lesser amounts. \n As an example,  Figure\u00a018.4  graphs the earnings per share of FedEx and Con Ed since \n1996. Note that FedEx\u2019s EPS is far more variable. Because the market values the entire stream of future dividends generated by the company, when earnings are temporar-ily depressed, the P/E ratio should tend to be high\u2014that is, the denominator of the ratio responds more sensitively to the business cycle than the numerator. This pattern is borne out well.  \n  Figure\u00a018.5  graphs the P/E ratios of the two firms. FedEx has greater earnings volatility \nand more variability in its P/E ratio. Its clearly higher average growth rate shows up in its generally higher P/E ratio. The only period in which Con Ed\u2019s ratio exceeded FedEx\u2019s was in 2012, a year when FedEx\u2019s earnings rose at a far faster rate than its underlying trend. The market seems to have decided that this earnings performance was not likely to be sus-tainable, and FedEx\u2019s price rose less dramatically than its annual earnings. Consequently, its P/E ratio declined.  \n This example shows why analysts must be careful in using P/E ratios. There is no way \nto say P/E ratio is overly high or low without referring to the company\u2019s long-run growth prospects, as well as to current earnings per share relative to the long-run trend line. \n Nevertheless,  Figures\u00a018.4  and  18.5  demonstrate a clear relation between P/E ratios and \ngrowth. Despite considerable short-run fluctuations, FedEx\u2019s EPS clearly trended upward over the period. Con Ed\u2019s earnings were essentially flat. FedEx\u2019s growth prospects are reflected in its consistently higher P/E multiple. \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   614bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   614 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 615\n This analysis suggests \nthat P/E ratios should vary \nacross industries, and in \nfact they do.

Other such comparative ratios are commonly used: \n  Price-to-Book Ratio   This is the ratio of price per share divided by book value per \nshare. As we noted earlier in this chapter, some analysts view book value as a useful mea-\nsure of value and therefore treat the ratio of price to book value as an indicator of how \naggressively the market values the firm.  \n  Price-to-Cash-Flow Ratio   Earnings as reported on the income statement can be \naffected by the company\u2019s choice of accounting practices, and thus are commonly viewed \nas subject to some imprecision and even manipulation. In contrast, cash flow\u2014which \ntracks cash actually flowing into or out of the firm\u2014is less affected by accounting deci-\nsions. As a result, some analysts prefer to use the ratio of price to cash flow per share \nrather than price to earnings per share. Some analysts use operating cash flow when cal-\nculating this ratio; others prefer \u201cfree cash flow,\u201d that is, operating cash flow net of new \ninvestment.  \n  Price-to-Sales Ratio   Many start-up firms have no earnings. As a result, the price\u2013\nearnings ratio for these firms is meaningless. The price-to-sales ratio (the ratio of stock \nprice to the annual sales per share) has recently become a popular valuation benchmark for \nthese firms. Of course, price-to-sales ratios can vary markedly across industries, because \nprofit margins vary widely. \n Figure 18.6 P/E ratios for different industries \n  Source: Yahoo!

This approach is particularly useful for firms that pay no dividends, for which the \ndividend discount model would be difficult to implement. But free cash flow models \nmay be applied to any firm and can provide useful insights about firm value beyond \nthe DDM. \n One approach is to discount the  free cash flow   for the  firm  (FCFF) at the weighted-\naverage cost of capital to obtain the value of the firm, and subtract the then-existing value \nof debt to find the value of equity. Another is to focus from the start on the free cash flow to \nequityholders   (FCFE), discounting those directly at the cost of equity to obtain the market \nvalue of equity. \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   617bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   617 7/17/13   4:08 PM7/17/13   4:08 PMFinal PDF to printer\n618 PART V  Security Analysis\n The free cash flow to the firm is the after-tax cash flow generated by the firm\u2019s \n operations, net of investments in capital, and net working capital. It includes cash flows \navailable to both debt- and equityholders.  9   It equals:  \n  FCFF5EBIT (12tc)1Depreciation 2Capital expenditures 2Increase in NWC \n (18.9)   \n where\n   EBIT\u00a0 5 \u00a0earnings before interest and taxes  \n   t  c \u00a0 5 \u00a0the corporate tax rate  \n  NWC\u00a0 5 \u00a0net working capital    \n Alternatively, we can focus on cash flow available to equityholders. This will differ \nfrom free cash flow to the firm by after-tax interest expenditures, as well as by cash flow \nassociated with net issuance or repurchase of debt (i.e., principal repayments minus pro-ceeds from issuance of new debt). \n   FCFE 5FCFF2Interest expense 3(12t\nc)1Increases in net debt  (18.10)   \n A free cash flow to the firm valuation model discounts year-by-year cash flows plus \nsome estimate of terminal value,  V   T  .

That terminal value may simply \nbe the present value of a constant-growth perpetuity (as in the formulas above) or it may be based on a multiple of EBIT, book value, earnings, or free cash flow. As a general rule, estimates of intrinsic value depend critically on terminal value. \n Spreadsheet 18.2 presents a free cash flow valuation of Honda using the data supplied \nby Value Line in  Figure\u00a018.2 . We start with the free cash flow to the firm approach given in Equation 18.9. Panel A of the spreadsheet lays out values supplied by Value Line. Entries for middle years are interpolated from beginning and final values. Panel B calculates free cash flow. The sum of after-tax profits in row 11 (from Value Line) plus after-tax interest payments in row 12 [i.e., interest expense\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 t  \nc )] equals EBIT(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 t  c ). In row 13 we \nsubtract the change in net working capital, in row 14 we add back depreciation, and in row 15 we subtract capital expenditures. The result in row 17 is the free cash flow to the firm, FCFF, for each year between 2013 and 2016. \n To find the present value of these cash flows, we will discount at WACC, which is \ncalculated in panel C. WACC is the weighted average of the after-tax cost of debt and the \n  9 This is firm cash flow assuming all-equity financing. Any tax advantage to debt financing is recognized by using \nan after-tax cost of debt in the computation of weighted-average cost of capital. This issue is discussed in any \nintroductory corporate finance text. \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   618bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   618 7/17/13   4:09 PM7/17/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 619\ncost of equity in each year. When computing WACC, we must account for the change in \nleverage forecast by Value Line.

Equity betas reflect both \nbusiness risk and financial risk. When a firm changes its capital structure (debt/equity mix), it changes financial risk, \nand therefore equity beta changes. How should we recognize the change in financial risk? As you may remember \nfrom an introductory corporate finance class, you must first unleverage beta. This leaves us with business risk. We \nuse the following formula to find unleveraged beta,  b  U  (where  D/E  is the firm\u2019s current debt-equity ratio): \n  bU5bL\n11(D/E)(12tc)  \n Then, we re-leverage beta in any particular year using the forecast capital structure for that year (which reintro-\nduces the financial risk associated with that year\u2019s capital structure): \n  bL5bU311(D/E)(12tc)4  \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   619bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   619 7/17/13   4:09 PM7/17/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\n620 PART V  Security Analysis\n    To find Honda\u2019s cost of debt, we note that its long-term bonds were rated A 1 \u00a0 in 2012 \nand that yields to maturity on this quality debt at the time were about 3.6%. Honda\u2019s debt-\nto-value ratio (assuming its debt is selling near par value) is computed in row 29. In 2012, the ratio was .27. Based on Value Line forecasts, it will fall to .20 by 2016. We interpolate the debt-to-value ratio for the intermediate years. WACC is computed in row 32. WACC increases slightly over time as the debt-to-value ratio declines between 2012 and 2016. The present value factor for cash flows accruing in each year is the previous year\u2019s factor divided by (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0WACC) for that year. The present value of each cash flow (row 37) is the \nfree cash flow times the cumulative discount factor. \n The terminal value of the firm (cell H17) is computed from the constant-growth model \nas FCFF \n2016 \u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 g )/(WACC 2016 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 g ), where  g  (cell B23) is the assumed value for the \nsteady growth rate. We assume in the spreadsheet that  g \u00a0 5 \u00a0.02, roughly in line with the \nlong-run growth rate of the broad economy.  11   Terminal value is also discounted back to \n2012 (cell H37), and the intrinsic value of the firm is thus found as the sum of discounted free cash flows between 2013 and 2016 plus the discounted terminal value. Finally, the value of debt in 2012 is subtracted from firm value to arrive at the intrinsic value of equity in 2012 (cell K37), and value per share is calculated in cell L37 as equity value divided by number of shares in 2012.\n  \n The free cash flow to equity approach yields a similar intrinsic value for the stock.  12   \nFCFE (row 18) is obtained from FCFF by subtracting after-tax interest expense and net debt repurchases. The cash flows are then discounted at the equity rate. Like WACC, the cost of equity changes each period as leverage changes. The present value factor for equity cash flows is presented in row 34. Equity value is reported in cell J38, which is put on a per share basis in cell L38.\n \n Spreadsheet 18.2 is available at the Online Learning Center for this text,   www.mhhe.\ncom/bkm   .   \n   Comparing the Valuation Models \n In principle, the free cash flow approach is fully consistent with the dividend discount model and should provide the same estimate of intrinsic value if one can extrapolate to a period in which the firm begins to pay dividends growing at a constant rate. This was demonstrated in two famous papers by Modigliani and Miller.  \n13   However, in practice, you \nwill find that values from these models may differ, sometimes substantially. This is due to the fact that in practice, analysts are always forced to make simplifying assumptions. For example, how long will it take the firm to enter a constant-growth stage? How should depreciation best be treated? What is the best estimate of ROE? Answers to questions like these can have a big impact on value, and it is not always easy to maintain consistent assumptions across the models.\n \n  11 In the long run a firm can\u2019t grow forever at a rate higher than the aggregate economy. So by the time we assert \nthat growth is in a stable stage, it seems reasonable that the growth rate should not be significantly greater than \nthat of the overall economy (although it can be less if the firm is in a declining industry). \n   12 Over the 2013\u20132016 period, Value Line predicts that Honda will retire a considerable fraction of its outstand-\ning debt. The implied debt repurchases are a use of cash and reduce the cash flow available to equity. Such \nrepurchases cannot be sustained indefinitely, however, for debt outstanding would soon be run down to zero. Therefore, in our estimate of the terminal value of equity, we compute the final cash flow assuming that starting in 2016 Honda will begin  issuing  enough debt to maintain its debt-to-value ratio. This approach is consistent with \nthe assumption of constant growth and constant discount rates after 2016.  \n   \n13 Franco Modigliani and M. Miller, \u201cThe Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and the Theory of Investment,\u201d \n American Economic Review,  June 1958, and \u201cDividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares,\u201d  Journal of \nBusiness,  October 1961.  \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   620bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   620 7/17/13   4:09 PM7/17/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 621\n We have now valued Honda using several approaches, with estimates of intrinsic value \nas follows:   \n  Model    Intrinsic Value  \n Two-stage dividend discount model  $38.81 \n DDM with earnings multiple terminal value  41.62 \n Three-stage DDM  40.29 \n Free cash flow to the firm  39.05 \n Free cash flow to equity  41.38 \n Market price (from Value Line)  32.88 \n What should we make of these differences? All the estimates are somewhat higher than \nHonda\u2019s actual stock price, perhaps indicating that they use an unrealistically high value \nfor the ultimate constant growth rate. For example, in the long run, it seems unlikely that Honda will be able to grow as rapidly as Value Line\u2019s forecast for 2016 growth, 7.5%. The two-stage dividend discount model is the most conservative of the estimates, largely because it assumes that Honda\u2019s dividend growth rate will fall to its terminal value after only 3 years. In contrast, the three-stage DDM allows growth to taper off over a longer period. Given the consistency with which all these estimates exceed market price, perhaps the stock is indeed underpriced compared to its intrinsic value. \n On balance, however, this valuation exercise suggests that finding bargains is not as easy as \nit seems. While these models are easy to apply, establishing proper inputs is more of a challenge. This should not be surprising. In even a moderately efficient market, finding profit opportunities will be more involved than analyzing Value Line data for a few hours. These models are extremely useful to analysts, however, because they provide ballpark estimates of intrinsic value. More than that, they force rigorous thought about underlying assumptions and highlight the variables with the greatest impact on value and the greatest payoff to further analysis.  \n  The Problem with DCF Models \n Our estimates of Honda\u2019s intrinsic value are all based on discounted cash flow (DCF) mod-els, in which we calculate the present value of forecasted cash flows and a terminal sales price at some future date. It is clear from the calculations for Honda that most of the action in these models is in the terminal value and that this value can be highly sensitive to even small changes in some input values (see, for example, Concept Check 18.4). Therefore, you must recognize that DCF valuation estimates are almost always going to be imprecise. Growth opportunities and future growth rates are especially hard to pin down. \n For this reason, many value investors employ a hierarchy of valuation. They view the most \nreliable components of value as the items on the balance sheet that allow for the most precise estimates of market value. Real estate, plant, and equipment would fall in this category. \n A somewhat less reliable component of value is the economic profit on assets already in \nplace. For example, a company like Intel earns a far higher ROE on its investments in chip-making facilities than its cost of capital. The present value of these \u201ceconomic profits,\u201d or economic value added,  \n14   is a major component of Intel\u2019s market value. This component \nof value is less certain than its balance sheet assets, however, because there is always a concern that new competitors will enter the market, force down prices and profit margins, and reduce the return on Intel\u2019s investments. Thus, one needs to carefully assess the barri-ers to entry that protect Intel\u2019s pricing and profit margins. We noted some of these barriers in the last chapter, where we discussed the role of industry analysis, market structure, and competitive position (see Section 17.7).\n  \n  14 We discuss economic value added in greater detail in the next chapter. \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   621bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   621 7/17/13   4:09 PM7/17/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\n622 PART V  Security Analysis\n Finally, the least reliable components of value are growth opportunities, the purported \nability of firms like Intel to invest in positive-NPV ventures that contribute to high mar-\nket valuations today. Value investors don\u2019t deny that such opportunities exist, but they are \nskeptical that precise values can be attached to them and, therefore, tend to be less willing \nto make investment decisions that depend on the value of those opportunities.    \n   18.6 The Aggregate Stock Market \n  The most popular approach to valuing the overall stock market is the earnings multiplier \napproach applied at the aggregate level. The first step is to forecast corporate profits for the \ncoming period. Then we derive an estimate of the earnings multiplier, the aggregate P/E \nratio, based on a forecast of long-term interest rates. The product of the two forecasts is the \nestimate of the end-of-period level of the market. \n The forecast of the P/E ratio of the market is sometimes derived from a graph similar to \nthat in  Figure\u00a018.8 , which plots the  earnings yield   (earnings per share divided by price per \nshare, the reciprocal of the P/E ratio) of the S&P 500 and the yield to maturity on 10-year \nTreasury bonds. The two series clearly move in tandem over time and suggest that this \nrelationship and the current yield on 10-year Treasury bonds could help in forecasting the \nearnings yield on the S&P 500. Given that earnings yield, a forecast of earnings could be \nused to predict the level of the S&P in some future period. Let\u2019s consider a simple example \nof this procedure.  \n Figure 18.8 Earnings yield of S&P 500 versus 10-year Treasury-bond yield  \n0246810121416\n1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010Yield (%)Treasury Yield\nEarnings Yield\n In mid-2012, the forecast for 12-month earnings per share for the S&P 500 portfolio \nwas about $110. The 10-year Treasury bond yield was about 2.9%. As a first approach, \nwe might posit that the spread between the earnings yield and the Treasury yield, \nwhich was around 3.9%, will remain at that level by the end of the year. Given a Trea-\nsury yield of 2.9%, this would imply an earnings yield for the S&P of 6.8%, and a  Example 18.6 Forecasting the Aggregate Stock Market \nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   622bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   622 7/17/13   4:09 PM7/17/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 623\n  Some analysts use an aggregate version of the dividend discount model rather than an \nearnings multiplier approach. All of these models, however, rely heavily on forecasts of \nsuch macroeconomic variables as GDP, interest rates, and the rate of inflation, which are \ndifficult to predict accurately. \n Because stock prices reflect expectations of future dividends, which are tied to the eco-\nnomic fortunes of firms, it is not surprising that the performance of a broad-based stock \nindex like the S&P 500 is taken as a leading economic indicator, that is, a predictor of the \nperformance of the aggregate economy. Stock prices are viewed as embodying consen-\nsus forecasts of economic activity and are assumed to move up or down in anticipation \nof movements in the economy. The government\u2019s index of leading economic indicators, \nwhich is taken to predict the progress of the business cycle, is made up in part of recent \nstock market performance. However, the predictive value of the market is far from perfect. \nA well-known joke, often attributed to Paul Samuelson, is that the market has forecast \neight of the last five recessions.    P/E ratio of 1/.068\u00a0 5 \u00a014.7. Our forecast for the level of the S&P index would then be \n14.7\u00a0 3 \u00a0110\u00a0 5 \u00a01,617. Given a current value for the S&P 500 of 1,457, this would imply \na 1-year capital gain on the index of 160/1,457\u00a0 5 \u00a011.0%. \n Of course, there is uncertainty regarding all three inputs into this analysis: the actual \nearnings on the S&P 500 stocks, the level of Treasury yields at year-end, and the spread \nbetween the Treasury yield and the earnings yield. One would wish to perform sensitivity \nor scenario analysis to examine the impact of changes in all of these variables. To illus-\ntrate, consider  Table\u00a018.4 , which shows a simple scenario analysis treating possible effects \nof variation in the Treasury bond yield. The scenario analysis shows that forecast level of \nthe stock market varies inversely and with dramatic sensitivity to interest rate changes.  \nTable 18.4\nS&P 500 index fore-\ncasts under various \nscenarios    Pessimistic \nScenario    Most Likely \nScenario    Optimistic \nScenario  \n Treasury bond yield  3.4%  2.9%  2.4% \n Earnings yield  7.3%  6.8%  6.3% \n Resulting P/E ratio  13.7  14.7  15.9 \n EPS forecast  110  110  110 \n Forecast for S&P 500  1,507  1,617  1,749 \n  Forecast for the earnings yield on the S&P 500 equals Treasury bond yield plus \n3.9%. The P/E ratio is the reciprocal of the forecast earnings yield.  \n     1 .   One approach to firm valuation is to focus on the firm\u2019s book value, either as it appears on the \nbalance sheet or as adjusted to reflect current replacement cost of assets or liquidation value. \nAnother approach is to focus on the present value of expected future dividends.  \n    2 .   The dividend discount model holds that the price of a share of stock should equal the present \nvalue of all future dividends per share, discounted at an interest rate commensurate with the risk \nof the stock.  \n    3 .   Dividend discount models give estimates of the intrinsic value of a stock. If price does not equal \nintrinsic value, the rate of return will differ from the equilibrium return based on the stock\u2019s risk. \nThe actual return will depend on the rate at which the stock price is predicted to revert to its \nintrinsic value.

The constant-growth version of the DDM asserts that if dividends are expected to grow at a \nconstant rate forever, the intrinsic value of the stock is determined by the formula \n  V05D1\nk2g  \n   This version of the DDM is simplistic in its assumption of a constant value of g. There are \nmore-sophisticated multistage versions of the model for more-complex environments. When the constant-growth assumption is reasonably satisfied and the stock is selling for its intrinsic value, the formula can be inverted to infer the market capitalization rate for the stock: \n  k5D\n1\nP01g   \n    5.  The constant-growth dividend discount model is best suited for firms that are expected to exhibit stable growth rates over the foreseeable future. In reality, however, firms progress through life cycles. In early years, attractive investment opportunities are ample and the firm responds with high plowback ratios and rapid dividend growth. Eventually, however, growth rates level off to more sustainable values. Three-stage growth models are well suited to such a pattern. These models allow for an initial period of rapid growth, a final period of steady dividend growth, and a middle, or transition, period in which the dividend growth rate declines from its initial high rate to the lower sustainable rate.  \n    6.  Stock market analysts devote considerable attention to a company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio. The P/E ratio is a useful measure of the market\u2019s assessment of the firm\u2019s growth opportunities. Firms with no growth opportunities should have a P/E ratio that is just the reciprocal of the capi-talization rate,  k.  As growth opportunities become a progressively more important component of \nthe total value of the firm, the P/E ratio will increase.  \n    7.  The expected growth rate of earnings is related both to the firm\u2019s expected profitability and to its dividend policy. The relationship can be expressed as \n  g5\n(ROE on new investment )3(12Dividend payout ratio )   \n    8.  You can relate any DDM to a simple capitalized earnings model by comparing the expected ROE on future investments to the market capitalization rate,  k.  If the two rates are equal, then \nthe stock\u2019s intrinsic value reduces to expected earnings per share (EPS) divided by  k.   \n    9.  Many analysts form their estimates of a stock\u2019s value by multiplying their forecast of next year\u2019s EPS by a predicted P/E multiple. Some analysts mix the P/E approach with the dividend discount model. They use an earnings multiplier to forecast the terminal value of shares at a future date, and add the present value of that terminal value with the present value of all interim dividend payments.  \n    10.  The free cash flow approach is the one used most often in corporate finance. The analyst first estimates the value of the entire firm as the present value of expected future free cash flows to the entire firm and then subtracts the value of all claims other than equity. Alternatively, the free cash flows to equity can be discounted at a discount rate appropriate to the risk of the stock.  \n    11.  The models presented in this chapter can be used to explain and forecast the behavior of the aggregate stock market. The key macroeconomic variables that determine the level of stock prices in the aggregate are interest rates and corporate profits.

Everyone in the market expects this situa-tion to persist indefinitely. \n     a .   What is the market price of Chiptech stock?

Suppose you discover that Chiptech\u2019s competitor has developed a new chip that will elimi-nate Chiptech\u2019s current technological advantage in this market. This new product, which will be ready to come to the market in 2 years, will force Chiptech to reduce the prices of its chips to remain competitive. This will decrease ROE to 15%, and, because of falling demand for its product, Chiptech will decrease the plowback ratio to .40. The plowback ratio will be decreased at the end of the second year, at  t \u00a0 5 \u00a02: The annual year-end dividend for \nthe second year (paid at  t \u00a0 5 \u00a02) will be 60% of that year\u2019s earnings.

Tables 18C  and  18D  present a summary of Dynamic\u2019s financial statements for the years 2012 and 2013. Selected data from the financial statements for the years 2009 to 2011 are presented in  Table 18E .  \n     a .   A group of Dynamic shareholders has expressed concern about the zero growth rate of divi-\ndends in the last 4 years and has asked for information about the growth of the company. Calculate Dynamic\u2019s sustainable growth rates in 2010 and 2013. Your calculations should use beginning-of-year balance sheet data.  \n    b .   Determine how the change in Dynamic\u2019s sustainable growth rate (2013 compared to 2010) was affected by changes in its retention ratio and its financial leverage. ( Note:  Your calcula-\ntions should use beginning-of-year balance sheet data.)    \nTable 18C\nDynamic Communica-\ntion balance sheets$ Million\n2013 2012\nCash and equivalents $   149 $     83\nAccounts receivable 295 265\nInventory      275      285\nTotal current assets $   719 $   633\nGross fixed assets 9,350 8,900\nAccumulated depreciation  (6,160) (5,677)\nNet fixed assets $3,190 $3,223\nTotal assets $3,909 $3,856\nAccounts payable $   228 $   220\nNotes payable 0 0\nAccrued taxes and expenses          0          0\nTotal current liabilities $   228 $   220\nLong-term debt $1,650 $1,800\nCommon stock 50 50\nAdditional paid-in capital 0 0\nRetained earnings   1,981   1,786\nTotal shareholders\u2019 equity $2,031 $1,836\nTotal liabilities and shareholders\u2019 equity $3,909 $3,856 Required rate of return on equity  14% \n Growth rate of industry  13% \n Industry P/E ratio  26 Table 18B\nSelected financial \ninformation\nbod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   629bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd   629 7/17/13   4:09 PM7/17/13   4:09 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm630 PART V  Security Analysis\n   6. Mike Brandreth, an analyst who specializes in the electronics industry, is preparing a research \nreport on Dynamic Communication. A colleague suggests to Brandreth that he may be able to \ndetermine Dynamic\u2019s implied dividend growth rate from Dynamic\u2019s current common stock price, using the Gordon growth model. Brandreth believes that the appropriate required rate of return for Dynamic\u2019s equity is 8%. \n     a .   Assume that the firm\u2019s current stock price of $58.49 equals intrinsic value. What sustained \nrate of dividend growth as of December 2013 is implied by this value? Use the constant-growth dividend discount model (i.e., the Gordon growth model).  \n    b .   The management of Dynamic has indicated to Brandreth and other analysts that the com-pany\u2019s current dividend policy will be continued. Is the use of the Gordon growth model to value Dynamic\u2019s common stock appropriate or inappropriate? Justify your response based on the assumptions of the Gordon growth model.    \n   7.

These techniques take \nthe firm\u2019s dividends and earnings prospects as inputs. Although the valuation analyst is interested in economic earnings streams, only financial accounting data are readily available. What can we learn from a company\u2019s account-ing data that can help us estimate the intrinsic value of its common stock? In this chapter, we show how investors can use financial data as inputs into stock valuation analysis. We start by reviewing the basic sources of such data\u2014the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. We note the dif-ference between economic and accounting earnings. Although economic earnings are more important for issues of valuation, they can at best be estimated, so, in practice, ana-lysts always begin their evaluation of the firm using accounting data. We show how analysts use financial ratios to explore the sources of a firm\u2019s profitability and evaluate the \u201cquality\u201d of its earnings in a systematic fashion. We also examine the impact of debt policy on various financial ratios. \n Finally, we conclude with a discussion of \nthe challenges you will encounter when using \nfinancial statement analysis as a tool in uncov-ering mispriced securities. Some of these issues arise from differences in firms\u2019 account-ing procedures. Others are due to inflation-induced distortions in accounting numbers.   Financial Statement \nAnalysis  CHAPTER NINETEEN \n   The Income Statement \n The    income statement    is a summary of the profitability of the firm over a period of time, \nsuch as a year. It presents revenues generated during the operating period, the expenses incurred during that same period, and the company\u2019s net earnings or profits, which are simply the difference between revenues and expenses. \n It is useful to distinguish four broad classes of expenses: cost of goods sold, which is \nthe direct cost attributable to producing the product sold by the firm; general and adminis-trative expenses, which correspond to overhead expenses, salaries, advertising, and other costs of operating the firm that are not directly attributable to production; interest expense on the firm\u2019s debt; and taxes on earnings owed to federal and local governments.     19.1 The Major Financial Statements \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   635bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   635 7/17/13   4:12 PM7/17/13   4:12 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 3 6 PART V  Security Analysis\n  Table\u00a0 19.1  presents an income statement for Home Depot (HD). At the top are the \ncompany\u2019s revenues from operations. Next come operating expenses, the costs incurred \nin the course of generating those revenues, including a depreciation allowance. The differ-\nence between operating revenues and operating costs is called  operating income.   Income \nor expenses from other, primarily nonrecurring, sources are then added or subtracted to \nobtain earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which is what the firm would have earned \nif not for obligations to its creditors and the tax authorities. EBIT is a measure of the profit-\nability of the firm\u2019s operations, ignoring any interest burden attributable to debt financing. \nThe income statement then goes on to subtract net interest expense from EBIT to arrive at \ntaxable income. Finally, the income tax due the government is subtracted to arrive at net \nincome, the \u201cbottom line\u201d of the income statement.  \n Analysts also commonly prepare a  common-size income statement,   in which all items \non the income statement are expressed as a fraction of total revenue. This makes it easier \nto compare firms of different sizes. The right-hand column of  Table\u00a019.1  is Home Depot\u2019s \ncommon-size income statement. \n In the previous chapter, we saw that stock valuation models require a measure of \n    economic earnings   \u2014the sustainable cash flow that can be paid out to stockholders without \nimpairing the productive capacity of the firm. In contrast,    accounting earnings    are affected \nby several conventions regarding the valuation of assets such as inventories (e.g., LIFO \nversus FIFO treatment), and by the way some expenditures such as capital investments are \nrecognized over time (as depreciation expenses). We discuss problems with some of these \naccounting conventions in greater detail later in the chapter. In addition to these accounting \nissues, as the firm makes its way through the business cycle, its earnings will rise above or \nfall below the trend line that might more accurately reflect sustainable economic earnings. \nThis introduces an added complication in interpreting net income figures. One might won-\nder how closely accounting earnings approximate economic earnings and, correspondingly, \nhow useful accounting data might be to investors attempting to value the firm. \n    $ Million    Percent of \nRevenue  \n  Operating revenues       \n  Net sales  70,395  100.0% \n  Operating expenses       \n  Cost of goods sold  46,133  65.5% \n  Selling, general & administrative expenses  14,346  20.4% \n  Other  1,560  2.2% \n  Depreciation  1,682  2.4% \n  Earnings before interest and income taxes    6,674  9.5% \n  Interest expense        606        0.9%  \n  Taxable income      6,068  8.6% \n  Taxes     2,185        3.1%  \n  Net income      3,883  5.5% \n  Allocation of net income     \n     Dividends  1,632  2.3% \n     Addition to retained earnings  2,251  3.2% \n   Note: Sums subject to rounding error.   \n Source: Home Depot  Annual Report,   year ending January 2012.

We see this in the fact that stock prices tend \nto increase when firms announce earnings greater than market analysts or investors had anticipated.  \n  The Balance Sheet \n While the income statement provides a measure of profitability over a period of time, the    balance sheet    provides a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the financial condition of the firm at a particular \nmoment. The balance sheet is a list of the firm\u2019s assets and liabilities at that moment. The difference in assets and liabilities is the net worth of the firm, also called  shareholders\u2019  or \n stockholders\u2019 equity.  Like income statements, balance sheets are reasonably standardized \nin  presentation.   Table\u00a019.2  is HD\u2019s balance sheet.   \n The first section of the balance sheet gives a listing of the assets of the firm. Current \nassets are presented first. These are cash and other items such as accounts receivable or inventories that will be converted into cash within 1 year. Next comes a listing of long-term or \u201cfixed\u201d assets.  Tangible fixed assets  are items such as buildings, equipment, or vehicles. \nHD also has several intangible assets such as a respected brand name and expertise. But accountants generally are reluctant to include these assets on the balance sheet, as they are so hard to value. However, when one firm purchases another for a premium over its book value, that difference, called \u201cgoodwill,\u201d is listed on the balance sheet as an  intangible \nfixed asset.  HD lists goodwill at $1,120 million.  \n1   The sum of current and fixed assets is \ntotal assets, the last line of the assets section of the balance sheet.   \n The liability and shareholders\u2019 equity (also called stockholders\u2019 equity) section is \narranged similarly. First come short-term, or \u201ccurrent,\u201d liabilities such as accounts pay-able, accrued taxes, and debts that are due within 1 year. Following this is long-term debt and other liabilities due in more than 1 year. The difference between total assets and total liabilities is stockholders\u2019 equity. This is the net worth, or book value, of the firm. Stock-holders\u2019 equity is divided into par value of stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, although this division is usually unimportant. Briefly, par value plus additional paid-in capital represent the proceeds realized from the sale of stock to the public, whereas retained earnings represent the buildup of equity from profits plowed back into the firm. Even if the firm issues no new equity, book value typically will increase each year due to reinvested earnings. \n The entries in the left columns of the balance sheet in  Table\u00a019.2  present the dollar \nvalue of each asset. Just as they compute common-size income statements, however, ana-lysts also find it convenient to use  common-size balance sheets  when comparing firms of \ndifferent sizes. Each item is expressed as a percentage of total assets. These entries appear in the right columns of  Table\u00a019.2 .  \n  The Statement of Cash Flows \n The income statement and balance sheets are based on accrual methods of accounting, which means that revenues and expenses are recognized at the time of a sale even if no cash has yet been exchanged. In contrast, the    statement of cash flows    tracks the cash \n  1 Firms are required to test their goodwill assets for \u201cimpairment\u201d each year. If the value of the acquired firm is \nclearly less than its purchase price, that amount must be charged off as an expense. For example, in 2012 Hewlett-\nPackard wrote off $8.8 billion on its earlier purchase of the software company Autonomy Corp. amid charges that Autonomy had overstated its profitability prior to the purchase. AOL Time Warner set a record when it recognized an impairment of $99 billion in 2002 following the January 2001 merger of Time Warner with AOL. \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   637bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   637 7/17/13   4:12 PM7/17/13   4:12 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 3 8 PART V  Security Analysis\nAssets $ MillionPercent of \nTotal Assets Liabilities and Shareholders\u2019 Equity $ MillionPercent of \nTotal Assets\nCurrent assets Current liabilities\n Cash and marketable securities 1,987 4.9%  Debt due for repayment 30 0.1%\n Receivables 1,245 3.1%  Accounts payable 8,199 20.2%\n Inventories 10,325 25.5%  Other current liabilities   1,147   2.8%\n Other current assets      963   2.4%   Total current liabilities 9,376 23.1%\n  Total current assets 14,520 35.8%\nFixed Assets Long-term debt 10,758 26.6%\n Tangible fixed assets Other long-term liabilities 2,486 6.1%\n  Property, plant, and equipment 24,448 60.3%\n  Other long-term assets      430   1.1% Total liabilities 22,620 55.8%\n   Total tangible fixed assets 24,878 61.4% Shareholders\u2019 equity\n Intangible fixed assets  Common stock and other paid-in capital 652 1.6%\n  Goodwill 1,120 2.8%  Retained earnings 17,246  42.6%\nTotal fixed assets 25,998 64.2%   Total shareholders\u2019 equity 17,898 44.2%\nTotal assets 40,518 100.0% Total liabilities and shareholders\u2019 equity 40,518 100.0%\n Table 19.2 \n Consolidated balance sheet for Home Depot \n  Note: Column sums subject to rounding error.  \n  Source:  Home Depot Annual Report, year ending January 2012. \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   638bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   638 7/17/13   4:12 PM7/17/13   4:12 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 639\nimplications of transactions. For example, if goods are sold now, with payment due in \n60\u00a0days, the income statement will treat the revenue as generated when the sale occurs, and \nthe balance sheet will be immediately augmented by accounts receivable, but the statement \nof cash flows will not show an increase in available cash until the bill is paid. \n  Table\u00a0 19.3  is the statement of cash flows for HD. The first entry listed under cash \n provided by operations is net income. The next entries modify that figure for components \nof income that have been recognized but for which cash has not yet changed hands. For \nexample, HD\u2019s accounts receivable increased by $170 million. This portion of sales was \nclaimed on the income statement, but the cash had not yet been collected. Increases in \naccounts receivable are in effect an investment in working capital, and therefore reduce \nthe cash flows realized from operations. Similarly, increases in accounts payable mean \nthat expenses have been recognized, but cash has not yet left the firm. Any payment delay \nincreases the company\u2019s net cash flows in this period.  \n Another major difference between the income statement and the statement of cash flows \ninvolves depreciation, which is a major addition to income in the adjustment section of the \nstatement of cash flows in  Table\u00a019.3 . The income statement attempts to \u201csmooth\u201d large \ncapital expenditures over time. The depreciation expense on the income statement does this \nby recognizing such expenditures over a period of many years rather than at the specific \ntime of purchase. In contrast, the statement of cash flows recognizes the cash implication \nof a capital expenditure when it occurs. Therefore, it adds back the depreciation \u201cexpense\u201d \n  Source:  Home Depot Annual Report,  year ending January 2012. $ Million\nCash provided by operations\nNet income $ 3,883\nAdjustments to net income\n Depreciation 1,682\n Changes in working capital\n  Decrease (increase) in receivables (170)\n  Decrease (increase) in inventories 256\n  Increase (decrease) in other current liabilities 405\n  Changes due to other operating activities       595\n   Total adjustments $ 2,768\nCash provided by operations 6,651\nCash flows from investments\nGross investment in tangible fixed assets $(1,221)\nInvestments in other assets         92\n Cash provided by (used for) investments $(1,129)\nCash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities\nAdditions to (reductions in) long-term debt $     966\nNet issues (repurchases of) shares (3,164)\nDividends (1,632)\nOther      (218)\n Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $(4,048)\nNet increase in cash $ 1,474 Table 19.3 \n Statement of cash flows for \nHome Depot \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   639bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   639 7/17/13   4:12 PM7/17/13   4:12 PMFinal PDF to printer\n640 PART V  Security Analysis\nthat was used to compute net income; instead, it acknowledges a capital expenditure when \nit is paid. It does so by reporting cash flows separately for operations, investing, and financing activities. This way, any large cash flows, such as those for big investments, can be recognized without affecting the measure of cash provided by operations. \n The second section of the statement of cash flows is the accounting of cash flows from \ninvesting activities. For example, HD used $1,221 million of cash investing in tangible fixed assets. These entries are investments in the assets necessary for the firm to maintain or enhance its productive capacity. \n Finally, the last section of the statement lists the cash flows realized from financing \nactivities. Issuance of securities will contribute positive cash flows, while repurchase or redemption of outstanding securities uses up cash. For example, HD expended $3,164 million to repurchase shares of its stock, which was a major use of cash. Its dividend payments, $1,632 million, also used cash. In total, HD\u2019s financing activities absorbed $4,048 million. \n To summarize, HD\u2019s operations generated a cash flow of $6,651 million. Some of that \ncash flow, $1,129 million, went to pay for new investments. Another part, $4,048 million, went to pay dividends and retire outstanding securities. HD\u2019s cash holdings therefore increased by 6,651\u00a0 2 \u00a01,129\u00a0 2  \u00a04,048\u00a0 5  \u00a0$1,474 million. This is reported on the last line \nof  Table\u00a019.3 . \n The statement of cash flows provides important evidence on the well-being of a firm. If \na company cannot pay its dividends and maintain the productivity of its capital stock out of cash flow from operations, for example, and it must resort to borrowing to meet these demands, this is a serious warning that the firm cannot maintain the dividend payout at its current level in the long run. The statement of cash flows will reveal this developing problem when it shows that cash flow from operations is inadequate and that borrowing is being used to maintain dividend payments at unsustainable levels.    \n In Chapter 1, we noted that a natural goal of the firm is to maximize value, but that various \nagency problems, or conflicts of interest, may impede that goal. How can we measure how well the firm is actually performing? Financial analysts have come up with a mind-numbing list of financial ratios that measure many aspects of firm performance. Before getting lost in the trees, however, let\u2019s first pause to consider what sorts of ratios may be related to the ultimate objective of added value. \n Two broad activities are the responsibility of a firm\u2019s financial managers: investment \ndecisions and financing decisions. Investment, or capital budgeting, decisions pertain to the firm\u2019s  use  of capital: the business activities in which it is engaged. Here, the questions \nwe will wish to answer pertain to the profitability of those projects. How should profit-ability be measured? How does the acceptable level of profitability depend on risk and the opportunity cost of the funds used to pay for the firm\u2019s many projects? In contrast, financial decisions pertain to the firm\u2019s  sources  of capital. Is there a sufficient supply of \nfinancing to meet projected needs for growth? Does the financing plan rely too heavily on borrowed funds? Is there sufficient liquidity to deal with unexpected cash needs? \n These questions suggest that we organize the ratios we choose to construct along the \nlines given in  Figure 19.1 . The figure shows that when evaluating the firm\u2019s investment activities, we will ask two questions: How efficiently does the firm deploy its assets, and how profitable are its sales? In turn, aspects of both efficiency and profitability can be mea-sured with several ratios: Efficiency is typically assessed using several turnover ratios, while \n   19.2 Measuring Firm Performance  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   640bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   640 7/17/13   4:12 PM7/17/13   4:12 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 641\nthe profitability of sales is commonly measured with various profit margins. Similarly, when \nevaluating financing decisions, we look at both leverage and liquidity, and we will see that \naspects of each of these two concepts also can be measured with an array of statistics. \n  The next section shows how to calculate and interpret some of these key financial ratios \nand shows how many of them are related.

Therefore, most profitability \nmeasures focus on earnings per dollar employed. The most common measures are return \non assets, return on capital, and return on equity.  \n   Return on Assets, ROA \n  Return on assets    equals EBIT as a fraction of the firm\u2019s total assets.  2      \nROA5EBIT\nTotal assets \nThe numerator of this ratio may be viewed as total operating income of the firm. There-\nfore, ROA tells us the income earned per dollar deployed in the firm.  \n  Return on Capital, ROC \n Return on capital expresses EBIT as a fraction of long-term capital, shareholders\u2019 equity \nplus long-term debt. It tells us the income earned per dollar of long-term capital invested \nin the firm.   \nROC5EBIT\nLong-term capital   19.3 Profitability Measures  \n2 ROA sometimes is computed using EBIT\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0Tax rate) in the numerator. Sometimes it is computed using \nafter-tax operating income, i.e., Net income\u00a0 1 \u00a0Interest\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 2 \u00a0Tax rate). Sometimes, it even is calculated using \njust net income in the numerator, although this definition ignores altogether the income the firm has generated for \ndebt investors. Unfortunately, definitions of many key financial ratios are not fully standardized. \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   641bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   641 7/17/13   4:12 PM7/17/13   4:12 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 4 2 PART V  Security Analysis\n     Return on Equity, ROE \n Whereas ROA and ROC measure profitability relative to funds raised by both debt and \nequity financing,    return on equity    focuses only on the profitability of equity invest-\nments. It equals net income realized by shareholders per dollar they have invested in \nthe firm.   \nROE5Net income\nShareholders\u2019 equit y  \n We noted in Chapter 18 that ROE is one of the two basic factors in determining a firm\u2019s \ngrowth rate of earnings. Sometimes it is reasonable to assume that future ROE will approx-\nimate its past value, but a high ROE in the past does not necessarily imply a firm\u2019s future \nROE will be high. A declining ROE, on the other hand, is evidence that the firm\u2019s new \ninvestments have offered a lower ROE than its past investments. The vital point for a secu-\nrity analyst is not to accept historical values as indicators of future values. Data from the \nrecent past may provide information regarding future performance, but the analyst should \nalways keep an eye on the future. Expectations of  future   dividends and earnings determine \nthe intrinsic value of the company\u2019s stock. \n Not surprisingly, ROA and ROE are linked, but as we will see next, their relationship is \naffected by the firm\u2019s financial policies.  \n  Financial Leverage and ROE \n An analyst interpreting the past behavior of a firm\u2019s ROE or forecasting its future value \nmust pay careful attention to the firm\u2019s debt-equity mix and to the interest rate on its debt. \nAn example will show why. Suppose Nodett is a firm that is all-equity financed and has \ntotal assets of $100 million. Assume it pays corporate taxes at the rate of 40% of taxable \nearnings. \n  Table\u00a0 19.4  shows the behavior of sales, earnings before interest and taxes, and net \nprofits under three scenarios representing phases of the business cycle. It also shows the \nbehavior of two of the most commonly used profitability measures: operating ROA, which \nequals EBIT/assets, and ROE, which equals net profits/equity.  \n Somdett is an otherwise identical firm to Nodett, but $40 million of its $100  million \nof assets are financed with debt bearing an interest rate of 8%. It pays annual interest \nexpenses of $3.2 million.  Table\u00a019.5  shows how Somdett\u2019s ROE differs from Nodett\u2019s.  \n Note that annual sales, EBIT, and therefore ROA for both firms are the same in each \nof the three scenarios; that is, business risk for the two companies is identical. But their \nfinancial risk differs. Although Nodett and Somdett have the same ROA in each scenario, \nSomdett\u2019s ROE exceeds that of Nodett in normal and good years and is lower in bad \nyears. \nScenarioSales \n($ millions)EBIT \n($ millions)ROA \n(% per year)Net Profit \n($ millions)ROE \n(% per year)\nBad year  80  5  5 3 3\nNormal year 100 10 10 6 6\nGood year 120 15 15 9 9 Table 19.4 \n Nodett\u2019s \nprofitability over \nthe business cycle \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   642bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   642 7/17/13   4:12 PM7/17/13   4:12 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 643\n We can summarize the exact relationship among ROE, ROA, and leverage in the \nfollowing equation:  3      \n ROE 5(12Tax rate ) BROA1(ROA2Interest rate ) Debt\nEquityR  (19.1)   \n The relationship has the following implications. If there is no debt or if the firm\u2019s ROA \nequals the interest rate on its debt, its ROE will simply equal (1\u00a0 2 \u00a0Tax rate)\u00a0 3 \u00a0ROA. If \nits ROA exceeds the interest rate, then its ROE will exceed (1\u00a0 2 \u00a0Tax rate)\u00a0 3 \u00a0ROA by an \namount that will be greater the higher the debt-to-equity ratio. \n This result makes sense: If ROA exceeds the borrowing rate, the firm earns more on its \nmoney than it pays out to creditors. The surplus earnings are available to the firm\u2019s owners, the \nequityholders, which increases ROE. If, on the other hand, ROA is less than the interest rate \npaid on debt, then ROE will decline by an amount that depends on the debt-to-equity ratio.  \n3 The derivation of Equation 19.1 is as follows:\nROE5Net pro fit\nEquity5EBIT2Interest 2Taxes\nEquity5(12Tax rate )(EBIT2Interest )\nEquity\n5(12Tax rate ) B(ROA3Assets )2(Interest rate 3Debt )\nEquityR\n5(12Tax rate ) BROA3Equity1Debt\nEquity2Interest rate 3Debt\nEquityR\n5(12Tax rate ) BROA1(ROA2Interest rate ) Debt\nEquityR   To illustrate the application of Equation 19.1, we can use the numerical example in \n Table\u00a019.5 . In a normal year, Nodett has an ROE of 6%, which is .6 (i.e., 1 minus the tax \nrate) times its ROA of 10%. However, Somdett, which borrows at an interest rate of 8% \nand maintains a debt-to-equity ratio of 2/3, has an ROE of 6.8%. The calculation using \nEquation 19.1 is   \nROE 5 .6[10% 1 (10% 2 8%) 2 \u20443]\n5 .6[10% 1 4 \u20443%] 5 6.8%  \n The important point is that increased debt will make a positive contribution to a firm\u2019s \nROE only if the firm\u2019s ROA exceeds the interest rate on the debt.

Table\u00a019.5  \nshows that ROE of Somdett is worse than that of Nodett in bad years. Conversely, in good \nyears, Somdett outperforms Nodett because the excess of ROA over ROE provides addi-tional funds for equityholders. The presence of debt makes Somdett\u2019s ROE more sensitive to the business cycle than Nodett\u2019s. Even though the two companies have equal business risk (reflected in their identical EBITs in all three scenarios), Somdett\u2019s stockholders bear greater financial risk than Nodett\u2019s because all of the firm\u2019s business risk is absorbed by a smaller base of equity investors. \n Even if financial leverage increases the expected ROE of Somdett relative to Nodett (as \nit seems to in  Table\u00a019.5 ), this does not imply that Somdett\u2019s share price will be higher. Financial leverage increases the risk of the firm\u2019s equity as surely as it raises the expected ROE, and the higher discount rate will offset the higher expected earnings.   \n Mordett is a company with the same assets as Nodett and Somdett but a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0 \nand an interest rate of 9%. What would its net profit and ROE be in a bad year, a normal year, and a good year?  CONCEPT CHECK 19.1 \n  Economic Value Added \n While profitability measures such as ROA, ROC, or ROE are commonly used to measure \nperformance, profitability is really not enough. A firm should be viewed as successful only if the return on its projects is better than the rate investors could expect to earn for themselves (on a risk-adjusted basis) in the capital market. Plowing back funds into the firm increases stock price  only  if the firm earns a higher rate of return on the reinvested \nfunds than the opportunity cost of capital, that is, the market capitalization rate. To account for this opportunity cost, we might measure the success of the firm using the  difference  \nbetween the return on capital, ROC, and the opportunity cost of capital,  k.     Economic value \nadded    is the spread between ROC and  k  multiplied by the capital invested in the firm. It \ntherefore measures the dollar value of the firm\u2019s return in excess of its opportunity cost. Another term for EV A (the term coined by Stern Stewart, a consulting firm that has pro-moted its use) is    residual income.      \n \n In 2012, Intel had a weighted-average cost of capital of 7.8% (based on its cost of \ndebt, its capital structure, its equity beta, and estimates derived from the CAPM for the cost of equity). Its return on capital was 13.9%, fully 6.1% greater than the oppor-tunity cost of capital on its investments in plant, equipment, and know-how. In other words, each dollar invested by Intel earned about 6.1 cents more than the return that investors could have anticipated by investing in equivalent-risk stocks. Intel earned this superior rate of return on a capital base of $56.34 billion. Its economic value added, that is, its return in excess of opportunity cost, was therefore (.139  2  .078)  3 \u00a0$56.34  5  \n$3.44 billion.  Example 19.2 Economic Value Added \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   644bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   644 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 645\n  Table\u00a0 19.6  shows EV A for a small sample of firms. The EV A leader in this sample \nwas Microsoft. Notice that ExxonMobil\u2019s EV A was greater than Intel\u2019s, despite a smaller \nmargin between its ROC and the cost of capital. This is because ExxonMobil applied its \nmargin to a much larger capital base. At the other extreme, AT&T earned less than its \nopportunity cost of capital, which resulted in a negative EV A.  \n Notice that even the EV A \u201closers\u201d in  Table\u00a019.6  reported positive accounting profits. \nFor example, by conventional standards, AT&T was solidly profitable in 2012, with an \nROC of 3.9%. But its cost of capital was higher, at 4.9%. By this standard, it did not \ncover its opportunity cost of capital, and returned a negative EV A in 2012. EV A treats \nthe opportunity cost of capital as a real cost that, like other costs, should be deducted \nfrom revenues to arrive at a more meaningful \u201cbottom line.\u201d A firm that is earning prof-\nits but is not covering its opportunity cost might be able to redeploy its capital to bet-\nter uses. Therefore, a growing number of firms now calculate EV A and tie managers\u2019 \ncompensation to it.    \n Source: Authors\u2019 calculations using data from    finance.yahoo.com.

Let us first focus on factors 3 and 4. Notice that their product, \nEBIT/Assets, gives us the firm\u2019s ROA.  \n Factor 3 is known as the firm\u2019s operating    profit margin    or    return on sales    (ROS), \nwhich equals operating profit per dollar of sales. In a normal year, profit margin is .10, or \n10%; in a bad year, it is .0625, or 6.25%; and in a good year, .125, or 12.5%. \n Factor 4, the ratio of sales to total assets, is known as    total asset turnover    (ATO). It \nindicates the efficiency of the firm\u2019s use of assets in the sense that it measures the annual \nsales generated by each dollar of assets. In a normal year, ATO for both firms is 1.0 per \nyear, meaning that sales of $1 per year were generated per dollar of assets. In a bad year, \nthis ratio declines to .8 per year, and in a good year, it rises to 1.2 per year. \n Comparing Nodett and Somdett, we see that factors 3 and 4 do not depend on a firm\u2019s \nfinancial leverage. The firms\u2019 ratios are equal to each other in all three scenarios. Similarly, \nfactor 1, the ratio of net income after taxes to pretax profit, is the same for both firms. \nWe call this the  tax-burden ratio.   Its value reflects both the government\u2019s tax code and the \npolicies pursued by the firm in trying to minimize its tax burden. In our example it does not \nchange over the business cycle, remaining a constant .6. \n Although factors 1, 3, and 4 are not affected by a firm\u2019s capital structure, factors 2 and \n5 are. Factor 2 is the ratio of pretax profits to EBIT. The firm\u2019s pretax profits will be great-\nest when there are no interest payments to be made to debtholders. In fact, another way to \nexpress this ratio is   \nPretax profits\nEBIT5EBIT2Interest expense\nEBIT \nWe will call this factor the  interest-burden ratio.   It takes on its highest possible value, 1, \nfor Nodett, which has no financial leverage. The higher the degree of financial leverage, \nthe lower the interest burden ratio. Nodett\u2019s ratio does not vary over the business cycle. \nIt is fixed at 1.0, reflecting the total absence of interest payments. For Somdett, how-\never, because interest expense is fixed in a dollar amount while EBIT varies, the interest \nburden ratio varies from a low of .36 in a bad year to a high of .787 in a good year. \nROE(1) \nNet Profit/\nPretax Profit(2) \nPretax \nProfit/EBIT(3) \nEBIT/Sales \n(Margin)(4) \nSales/Assets \n(Turnover)(5) \nAssets/\nEquity(6) \nCompound \nLeverage \nFactor (2) 3 (5)\nBad year\n Nodett .030 .6 1.000 .0625 0.800 1.000 1.000\n Somdett .018 .6 0.360 .0625 0.800 1.667 0.600\nNormal year\n Nodett .060 .6 1.000 .1000 1.000 1.000 1.000\n Somdett .068 .6 0.680 .1000 1.000 1.667 1.134\nGood year\n Nodett .090 .6 1.000 .1250 1.200 1.000 1.000\n Somdett .118 .6 0.787 .1250 1.200 1.667 1.311\n Table 19.7 \n Ratio decomposition analysis for Nodett and Somdett \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   646bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   646 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 647\n A closely related statistic to the interest burden ratio is the    interest coverage ratio,      o r  \n   times interest earned.      The ratio is defined as   \nInterest coverage 5 EBIT/Interest expense \nA high coverage ratio indicates that the likelihood of bankruptcy is low because annual \nearnings are significantly greater than annual interest obligations. It is widely used by both lenders and borrowers in determining the firm\u2019s debt capacity and is a major determinant of the firm\u2019s bond rating. \n Factor 5, the ratio of assets to equity, is a measure of the firm\u2019s degree of financial lever-\nage. It is called the    leverage ratio    and is equal to 1 plus the total debt-to-equity ratio.  \n4   In our \nnumerical example in  Table\u00a019.7 , Nodett has a leverage ratio of 1, while Somdett\u2019s is 1.667.  \n From our discussion in Section 19.2, we know that financial leverage helps boost ROE \nonly if ROA is greater than the interest rate on the firm\u2019s debt. How is this fact reflected in the ratios of  Table\u00a019.7 ? \n The answer is that to measure the full impact of leverage in this framework, the analyst \nmust take the product of the interest burden and leverage ratios (i.e., factors 2 and 5, shown in  Table\u00a019.7  as column 6). For Nodett, factor 6, which we call the  compound leverage factor,   \nremains a constant 1.0 under all three scenarios. But for Somdett, we see that the compound leverage factor is greater than 1 in normal years (1.134) and in good years (1.311), indicating the positive contribution of financial leverage to ROE. It is less than 1 in bad years, reflecting the fact that when ROA falls below the interest rate, ROE falls with increased use of debt. \n We can summarize all of these relationships as follows. From Equation 19.2,   \nROE 5 Tax burden 3 Interest burden 3 Margin 3 Turnover 3 Leverage \nBecause   \n ROA 5 Margin 3 Turnover  (19.3)  \nand   \nCompound leverage factor 5 Interest burden 3 Leverage \nwe can decompose ROE equivalently as follows:    ROE 5 Tax burden 3 ROA 3 Compound leverage factor  (19.4)   \n Equation 19.3 shows that ROA is the  product  of margin and turnover. High values of \none of these ratios are often accompanied by low values of the other. For example, Walmart \nhas low profit margins but high turnover, while Tiffany has high margins but low turnover. Firms would love to have high values for both margin and turnover, but this generally will not be possible: Retailers with high markups will sacrifice sales volume, and conversely, those with low turnover need high margins just to remain viable. Therefore, comparing these ratios in isolation usually is meaningful only in evaluating firms following similar strategies in the same industry. Cross-industry comparison can be misleading. \n  Figure 19.2  shows evidence of the turnover-profit margin trade-off. Industries with high \nturnover such as groceries or retail apparel tend to have low profit margins, while indus-tries with high margins such as utilities tend to have low turnover. The two curved lines in the figure trace out turnover-margin combinations that result in an ROA of either 3% or 6%. You can see that most industries lie inside of this range, so ROA across industries demonstrates far less variation than either turnover or margin taken in isolation.  \n \n  4    Assets\nEquity5Equity1Debt\nEquity511Debt\nEquity  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   647bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   647 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 4 8 PART V  Security Analysis\n Consider two firms with the same ROA of 10% per year. The first is a discount super-\nmarket chain, the second is a gas and electric utility. \n As  Table\u00a019.8  shows, the supermarket chain has a \u201clow\u201d profit margin of 2% and \nachieves a 10% ROA by \u201cturning over\u201d its assets five times per year. The capital-intensive \nutility, on the other hand, has a \u201clow\u201d asset turnover ratio of only .5 times per year and \nachieves its 10% ROA through its higher, 20%, profit margin. The point here is that a \n\u201clow\u201d margin or asset turnover ratio need not indicate a troubled firm. Each ratio must \nbe interpreted in light of industry norms.

For example, we \ncan think about turnover relative to fixed rather than total assets:   \nFixed-asset turnover 5Sales\nFixed assets \nThis ratio measures sales per dollar of the firm\u2019s money tied up in fixed assets. \n To illustrate how you can compute this and other ratios from a firm\u2019s financial state-\nments, consider Growth Industries, Inc.

To understand better why GI underperformed, we can compute asset utilization ratios \nseparately for fixed assets, inventories, and accounts receivable. \n GI\u2019s sales in 2013 were $144 million. Its only fixed assets were plant and equip-\nment, which were $216 million at the beginning of the year and $259.2 million at year\u2019s end. Average fixed assets for the year were, therefore, $237.6 million [($216 million  1  $259.2 million)/2]. GI\u2019s fixed-asset turnover for 2013 therefore was $144 million per \nyear/$237.6 million  5  .606 per year. In other words, for every dollar of fixed assets, there \nwere $.606 in sales. \n Comparable figures for the fixed-asset turnover ratio for 2011 and 2012 and the 2013 \nindustry average are  \n2011 2012 2013 2013 Industry Average\n.606 .606 .606 .700\nGI\u2019s fixed asset turnover has been stable over time and below the industry average. \n Notice that when a financial ratio includes one item from the income statement, which \ncovers a period of time, and another from a balance sheet, which is a \u201csnapshot\u201d at a \nparticular time, common practice is to take the average of the beginning and end-of-year balance sheet figures. Thus in computing the fixed-asset turnover ratio we divided sales (from the income statement) by average fixed assets (from the balance sheet). \n Another widely followed turnover ratio is the    inventory turnover ratio,      which is the \nratio of cost of goods sold per dollar of average inventory. (We use the cost of goods sold instead of sales revenue in the numerator to maintain consistency with inventory, which is valued at cost.) This ratio measures the speed with which inventory is turned over. \n In 2011, GI\u2019s cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation) was $40 million, and its \naverage inventory was $82.5 million [($75\u00a0million\u00a0 1 \u00a0$90\u00a0million)/2]. Its inventory turn-\nover was .485 per year ($40 million/$82.5 million). In 2012 and 2013, inventory turnover remained the same, which was below the industry average of .5 per year. In other words, GI was burdened with a higher level of inventories per dollar of sales than its competitors. This higher investment in working capital in turn resulted in a higher level of assets per dollar of sales or profits, and a lower ROA than its competitors. \n Another aspect of efficiency surrounds management of accounts receivable, which is \noften measured by  days sales in receivables,  that is, the average level of accounts receiv-\nable expressed as a multiple of daily sales. It is computed as average accounts receivable/sales\u00a0  3 \u00a0 365 and may be interpreted as the number of days\u2019 worth of sales tied up in \naccounts receivable. You can also think of it as the average lag between the date of sale and the date payment is received, and is therefore also called the    average collection period.      \n For GI in 2013 the average collection period was 100.4 days:   \n($36 million 1$43.2 million )/2\n$144 million33655100.4 days  \nThe industry average was only 60 days. This statistic tells us that GI\u2019s average receivables per dollar of sales exceeds that of its competitors. Again, this implies a higher required investment in working capital, and ultimately a lower ROA. \n In summary, these ratios show us that GI\u2019s poor total asset turnover relative to the indus-\ntry is in part caused by lower-than-average fixed-asset turnover and inventory turnover and higher-than-average days receivables. This suggests GI may be having problems with excess plant capacity along with poor inventory and receivables management practices.  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   650bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   650 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 651\n  Liquidity Ratios \n Leverage is one measure of the safety of a firm\u2019s debt. Debt ratios compare the firm\u2019s \nindebtedness to broad measures of its assets, and coverage ratios compare various mea-sures of earning power against the cash flow needed to satisfy debt obligations. But lever-age is not the only determinant of financial prudence. You also want to know that a firm can lay its hands on cash either to pay its scheduled obligations or to meet unforeseen obligations.    Liquidity    is the ability to convert assets into cash at short notice. Liquidity is \ncommonly measured using the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio. \n    1 .     Current ratio:      Current assets/current liabilities. This ratio measures the ability of \nthe firm to pay off its current liabilities by liquidating its current assets (i.e., turning them into cash). It indicates the firm\u2019s ability to avoid insolvency in the short run. GI\u2019s current ratio in 2011, for example, was (60\u00a0 1 \u00a030\u00a0 1 \u00a090)/(36\u00a0 1 \u00a087.3)\u00a0 5 \u00a01.46. \nIn other years, it was  \n2011 2012 2013 2013 Industry Average\n1.46 1.17 .97 2.0\n  This represents an unfavorable time trend and poor standing relative to the indus-\ntry. This troublesome pattern is not surprising given the working capital burden resulting from GI\u2019s subpar performance with respect to receivables and inventory management.  \n   2.    Quick ratio:      (Cash\u00a0 1 \u00a0marketable securities\u00a0 1 \u00a0receivables)/current liabilities. This \nratio is also called the    acid test ratio.      It has the same denominator as the current \nratio, but its numerator includes only cash, cash equivalents, and receivables. The quick ratio is a better measure of liquidity than the current ratio for firms whose inventory is not readily convertible into cash. GI\u2019s quick ratio shows the same dis-turbing trends as its current ratio:    \n2011 2012 2013 2013 Industry Average\n.73 .58 .49 1.0\n   3.    Cash ratio.      A company\u2019s receivables are less liquid than its holdings of cash and \nmarketable securities. Therefore, in addition to the quick ratio, analysts also com-pute a firm\u2019s cash ratio, defined as   \nCash ratio 5Cash1Marketable securities\nCurrent liabilities  \n   GI\u2019s cash ratios are  \n2011 2012 2013 2013 Industry Average\n.487 .389 .324 .70\nGI\u2019s liquidity ratios have fallen dramatically over this 3-year period, and by 2013, its liquidity measures are far below industry averages. The decline in the liquidity ratios com-bined with the decline in coverage ratio (you can confirm that times interest earned has also fallen over this period) suggests that its credit rating has been declining as well, and, no doubt, GI is considered a relatively poor credit risk in 2013.    \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   651bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   651 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n652 PART V  Security Analysis\n  Market Price Ratios: Growth versus Value \n The    market\u2013book-value ratio    (P/B) equals the market price of a share of the firm\u2019s common \nstock divided by its  book value,  that is, shareholders\u2019 equity per share. Some analysts consider \nthe stock of a firm with a low market\u2013book value to be a \u201csafer\u201d investment, seeing the book value as a \u201cfloor\u201d supporting the market price. These analysts presumably view book value as the level below which market price will not fall because the firm always has the option to liquidate, or sell, its assets for their book values. However, this view is questionable. In fact, some firms do sell below book value. For example, in mid-2012, shares in both Bank of America and Citigroup sold for less than 50% of book value. Nevertheless, a low market\u2013book-value ratio is seen by some as providing a \u201cmargin of safety,\u201d and some analysts will screen out or reject high-P/B firms in their stock selection process. \n In fact, a better interpretation of the market-price-to-book ratio is as a measure of \ngrowth opportunities. Recall from the previous chapter that we may view the two com-ponents of firm value as assets in place and growth opportunities. As the next example illustrates, firms with greater growth opportunities will tend to exhibit higher multiples of market-price-to-book value.  \n Consider two firms, both with book value per share of $10, both with a market capital-\nization rate of 15%, and both with plowback ratios of .60. \n Bright Prospects has an ROE of 20%, which is well in excess of the market capitaliza-\ntion rate; this ROE implies that the firm is endowed with ample growth opportunities. \nWith ROE\u00a0 5 \u00a0.20, Bright Prospects will earn $2 per share this year. With its plowback \nratio of .60, it pays out a dividend of  D  1   5  (1  2  .6)  3  $2  5  $.80, has a growth rate of \n g   5   b   3  ROE  5  .60  3  .20  5  .12, and a stock price of  D  1 /( k   2   g )  5  $.80/(.15  2  .12)\u00a0 5  \n$26.67. Its price\u2013book ratio is 26.67/10\u00a0 5 \u00a02.667. \n In contrast, Past Glory has an ROE of only 15%, just equal to the market capital-\nization rate. It therefore will earn $1.50 per share this year and will pay a dividend of \n D  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.4\u00a03\u00a0$1.50\u00a0 5 \u00a0$.60.

Not \nsurprisingly, a firm that earns just the required rate of return on its investments will sell \nfor book value, and no more. \n We conclude that the market-price-to-book-value ratio is determined in large part by \ngrowth prospects.  Example 19.4 Price to Book and Growth Options \n Another measure used to place firms along a growth versus value spectrum is the    price\u2013\nearnings (P/E) ratio.      In fact, we saw in the last chapter that the ratio of the present value \nof growth options to the value of assets in place largely determines the P/E multiple. While \nlow-P/E stocks allow you to pay less per dollar of  current  earnings, the high-P/E stock may \nstill be a better bargain if its earnings are expected to grow quickly enough.  5    \n Many analysts nevertheless believe that low-P/E stocks are more attractive than high-\nP/E stocks. And in fact, low-P/E stocks have generally been positive-alpha investments using the CAPM as a return benchmark. But an efficient market adherent would discount this track record, arguing that such a simplistic rule could not really generate abnormal returns, and that the CAPM may not be a good benchmark for returns in this case. \n  5 Remember, though, P/E ratios reported in the financial pages are based on  past  earnings, while price is deter-\nmined by the firm\u2019s prospects of  future  earnings. Therefore, reported P/E ratios may reflect variation in current \nearnings around a trend line. \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   652bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   652 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 653\n In any event, the important points to remember are that ownership of the stock conveys \nthe right to future as well as current earnings and, therefore, that a high P/E ratio may \nbest be interpreted as a signal that the market views the firm as enjoying attractive growth \nopportunities. \n Before leaving the P/B and P/E ratios, it is worth pointing out an important relationship \nbetween them:   \n ROE 5Earnings\nBook value5Market price\nBook value4Market price\nEarnin gs  (19.5)   \n5P/B ratio4P/E ratio\n By rearranging the terms, we find that a firm\u2019s P/E ratio equals its price-to-book ratio \ndivided by ROE:   \nP\nE5P/B\nROE \nThus a company with a high P/B ratio nevertheless can have a relatively low P/E if its ROE \nis high enough. \n Wall Street often distinguishes between \u201cgood firms\u201d and \u201cgood investments.\u201d A good firm \nmay be highly profitable, with a correspondingly high ROE. But if its stock price is bid up to a \nlevel commensurate with this ROE, its P/B ratio will also be high, and the stock price may be \na relatively large multiple of earnings, thus reducing its attractiveness as an investment. The \nhigh ROE of the firm does not by itself imply that the  stock   is a good investment. Conversely, \ntroubled firms with low ROEs can be good investments if their prices are low enough. \n  Table\u00a019.10  summarizes the ratios reviewed in this section.    \n What were GI\u2019s ROE, P/E, and P/B ratios in the year 2013? How do they compare to the industry average \nratios, which were: ROE\u00a0 5 \u00a08.64%;\u00a0P/E\u00a0 5 \u00a08;\u00a0P/B\u00a0 5 \u00a0.69?

To evalu-\nate the performance of a given firm, \nhowever, you need a benchmark to \nwhich you can compare its ratios. \nOne obvious benchmark is the ratio \nfor the same company in earlier years. \nFor example,  Figure 19.3  shows HD\u2019s \nreturn on assets, profit margin, and \nasset turnover ratio for the last few \nyears. You can see there that a good \npart of the decline in ROA between \n2005 and 2009 was due to HD\u2019s fall-\ning profit margin. In 2008, margin \nimproved but turnover fell, resulting \nin a further drop in ROA.   \n051015202530\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012RatioROATurnover \u00d7 10\nPro\ufb01t Margin\n Figure 19.3 DuPont decomposition for Home Depot  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   653bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   653 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 5 4 PART V  Security Analysis\n Table 19.10 \n Summary of key \nfinancial ratios   Leverage   \n Interest burden EBIT2Interest expense\nEBIT  \n Interest coverage \n(Times interest earned) EBIT\nInterest expense  \n Leverage Assets\nEquity511Debt\nEquity  \n Compound leverage factor  Interest burden\u00a0 3 \u00a0Leverage \n  Asset utilization   \n Total asset turnover Sales\nAverage total assets  \n Fixed asset turnover Sales\nAverage fixed assets  \n Inventory turnover Cost o f goods sold\nAverage inventories  \n Days sales in receivables Average accounts receivable\nAnnual sales3365  \n  Liquidity   \n Current ratio Current assets\nCurrent liabilities  \n Quick ratio Cash1Marketable securities 1Receivables\nCurrent liabilities  \n Cash ratio Cash1Marketable securities\nCurrent liabilities  \n  Profitability   \n Return on assets EBIT\nAverage total assets  \n Return on equity Net income\nAverage stockholders\u2019 equity  \n Return on sales (Profit margin) EBIT\nSales  \n  Market price   \n Market-to-book Price per share\nBook value per share  \n Price\u2013earnings ratio Price per share\nEarnings per share  \n Earnings yield Earnings per share\nPrice per share  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   654bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   654 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 655\n Table 19.11 \n Financial ratios for major industry groups \n Source: U.S. Department of Commerce , Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing, Mining and Trade Corporations,   third quarter \n2012.

As in 2014, sales, assets, \nand operating income all continued to grow at a rate of 20%.\u201d \n Is she right? \n We can evaluate her statement by conducting a full-scale ratio analysis of Growth \nIndustries. Our purpose is to assess GI\u2019s performance in the recent past, to evaluate its \nfuture prospects, and to determine whether its market price reflects its intrinsic value. \n  Table\u00a019.12  shows the key financial ratios we can compute from GI\u2019s financial state-\nments. The president is certainly right about the growth rate in sales, assets, and operating \nincome. Inspection of GI\u2019s key financial ratios, however, contradicts her first sentence: 2015 \nwas not another successful year for GI\u2014it appears to have been another miserable one.     19.5 An Illustration of Financial Statement Analysis  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   655bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   655 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n6 5 6 PART V  Security Analysis\n ROE has been declining steadily from 7.51% in 2013 to 3.03% in 2015. A comparison \nof GI\u2019s 2015 ROE to the 2015 industry average of 8.64% makes the deteriorating time \ntrend appear especially alarming. The low and falling market-to-book-value ratio and the \nfalling price\u2013earnings ratio indicate investors are less and less optimistic about the firm\u2019s \nfuture profitability. \n The fact that ROA has not been declining, however, tells us that the source of the \ndeclining time trend in GI\u2019s ROE must be related to financial leverage. And we see that as \nGI\u2019s leverage ratio climbed from 2.117 in 2013 to 2.723 in 2015, its interest-burden ratio \n( column 2) worsened from .650 to .204\u2014with the net result that the compound leverage \nfactor fell from 1.376 to .556. \n The rapid increase in short-term debt from year to year and the concurrent increase in \ninterest expense (see  Table\u00a019.9 ) make it clear that to finance its 20% growth rate in sales, \nGI has incurred sizable amounts of short-term debt at high interest rates. The firm is pay-\ning rates of interest greater than the ROA it is earning on the investment financed with the \nnew borrowing. As the firm has expanded, its situation has become ever more precarious. \n In 2015, for example, the average interest rate on GI\u2019s short-term debt was 20% ver-\nsus an ROA of 9.09%. (You can calculate the interest rate on GI\u2019s short-term debt using \nthe data in  Table\u00a019.9  as follows. The balance sheet shows us that the coupon rate on its \nlong-term debt was 8%, and its par value was $75 million. Therefore the interest paid on \nthe long-term debt was .08  3  $75 million  5  $6 million. Total interest paid in 2015 was \n$34,391,000, so the interest paid on the short-term debt must have been $34,391,000  2\n$6,000,000  5  $28,391,000. This is 20% of GI\u2019s short-term debt at the start of the year.) \n GI\u2019s problems become clear when we examine its statement of cash flows in  Table\u00a019.13 . \nThe statement is derived from the income statement and balance sheet data in  Table\u00a019.9 . \nGI\u2019s cash flow from operations is falling steadily, from $12,700,000 in 2013 to $6,725,000 \nin 2015. The firm\u2019s investment in plant and equipment, by contrast, has increased greatly. \nNet plant and equipment (i.e., net of depreciation) rose from $150,000,000 in 2012 to \n$259,200,000 in 2015 (see  Table\u00a0 19.9 ). This near doubling of capital assets makes the \ndecrease in cash flow from operations all the more troubling.  \n The source of the difficulty is GI\u2019s enormous amount of short-term borrowing. In a \nsense, the company is being run as a pyramid scheme. It borrows more and more each \nyear to maintain its 20% growth rate in assets and income.

But comparing financial results of different com-panies is not so simple. There is more than one acceptable way to represent various items of revenue and expense according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This means two firms may have exactly the same economic income yet very different accounting incomes. \n Furthermore, interpreting a single firm\u2019s performance over time is complicated when \ninflation distorts the dollar measuring rod. Comparability problems are especially acute in this case because the impact of inflation on reported results often depends on the par-ticular method the firm adopts to account for inventories and depreciation. The security analyst must adjust the earnings and the financial ratio figures to a uniform standard before attempting to compare financial results across firms and over time. \n Comparability problems can arise out of the flexibility of GAAP guidelines in account-\ning for inventories and depreciation and in adjusting for the effects of inflation. Other important potential sources of noncomparability include the capitalization of leases and other expenses, the treatment of pension costs, and allowances for reserves.  \n   Inventory Valuation \n There are two commonly used ways to value inventories:    LIFO    (last-in first-out) and \n   FIFO    (first-in first-out). We can explain the difference using a numerical example. \n Suppose Generic Products, Inc. (GPI), has a constant inventory of 1 million units of \ngeneric goods. The inventory turns over once per year, meaning the ratio of cost of goods \nsold to inventory is 1. \n The LIFO system calls for valuing the million units used up during the year at the cur-\nrent cost of production, so that the last goods produced are considered the first ones to be sold. They are valued at today\u2019s cost. \n The FIFO system assumes that the units used up or sold are the ones that were added to \ninventory first, and goods sold should be valued at original cost. \n If the price of generic goods has been constant, at the level of $1, say, the book value \nof inventory and the cost of goods sold would be the same, $1 million under both systems. But suppose the price of generic goods rises by 10 cents per unit during the year as a result of general inflation. \n LIFO accounting would result in a cost of goods sold of $1.1 million, whereas the end-\nof-year balance sheet value of the 1 million units in inventory remains $1 million. The balance sheet value of inventories is given as the cost of the goods still in inventory. Under LIFO the last goods produced are assumed to be sold at the current cost of $1.10; the goods remaining are the previously produced goods, at a cost of only $1. You can see that although LIFO accounting accurately measures the cost of goods sold today, it understates the current value of the remaining inventory in an inflationary environment. \n In contrast, under FIFO accounting, the cost of goods sold would be $1 million, and the \nend-of-year balance sheet value of the inventory would be $1.1 million. The result is that the LIFO firm has both a lower reported profit and a lower balance sheet value of invento-ries than the FIFO firm. \n LIFO is preferred over FIFO in computing economic earnings (i.e., real sustainable \ncash flow) because it uses up-to-date prices to evaluate the cost of goods sold. However,    19.6 Comparability Problems  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   658bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   658 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 659\nLIFO accounting induces balance sheet distortions when it values investment in invento-\nries at original cost. This practice results in an upward bias in ROE because the investment base on which return is earned is undervalued.  \n  Depreciation \n Another source of problems is the measurement of depreciation, which is a key factor in computing true earnings. The accounting and economic measures of depreciation can dif-fer markedly. According to the  economic  definition, depreciation is the amount of a firm\u2019s \noperating cash flow that must be reinvested in the firm to sustain its real productive  capacity at the current level. \n The  accounting  measurement is quite different. Accounting depreciation is the amount \nof the original acquisition cost of an asset that is allocated to each accounting period over an arbitrarily specified life of the asset. This is the figure reported in financial statements. \n Assume, for example, that a firm buys machines with a useful economic life of \n20 years at $100,000 apiece. In its financial statements, however, the firm can depreci-ate the machines over 10 years using the straight-line method, for $10,000 per year in depreciation. Thus after 10 years a machine will be fully depreciated on the books, even though it remains a productive asset that will not need replacement for another 10 years. \n In computing accounting earnings, this firm will overestimate depreciation in the first \n10 years of the machine\u2019s economic life and underestimate it in the last 10 years. This will cause reported earnings to be understated compared with economic earnings in the first 10 years and overstated in the last 10 years. \n Depreciation comparability problems add one more wrinkle. A firm can use different \ndepreciation methods for tax purposes than for other reporting purposes. Most firms use accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes and straight-line depreciation in pub-lished financial statements. There also are differences across firms in their estimates of the depreciable life of plant, equipment, and other depreciable assets. \n Another complication arises from inflation. Because conventional depreciation is based \non historical costs rather than on the current replacement cost of assets, measured depreci-ation in periods of inflation is understated relative to replacement cost, and  real  economic \nincome (sustainable cash flow) is correspondingly overstated. \n For example, suppose Generic Products, Inc., has a machine with a 3-year useful \nlife that originally cost $3 million. Annual straight-line depreciation is $1 million, regardless of what happens to the replacement cost of the machine. Suppose inflation in the first year turns out to be 10%. Then the true annual depreciation expense is $1.1 million in current terms, whereas conventionally measured depreciation remains fixed at $1 million per year. Accounting income overstates  real  economic income by \n$.1 million.  \n  Inflation and Interest Expense \n Although inflation can cause distortions in the measurement of a firm\u2019s inventory and depreciation costs, it has perhaps an even greater effect on calculation of  real  interest \nexpense. Nominal interest rates include an inflation premium that compensates the lender for inflation-induced erosion in the real value of principal. From the perspective of both lender and borrower, therefore, part of what is conventionally measured as interest expense should be treated more properly as repayment of principal. \n \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   659bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   659 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n660 PART V  Security Analysis\n Mismeasurement of real interest means inflation deflates the computation of real \nincome. The effects of inflation on the reported values of inventories and depreciation that \nwe have discussed work in the opposite direction.    Suppose Generic Products has debt outstanding with a face value of $10 million at an \ninterest rate of 10% per year. Interest expense as conventionally measured is $1 million per year. However, suppose inflation during the year is 6%, so that the real interest rate is 4%. Then $.6 million of what appears as interest expense on the income state-ment is really an inflation premium, or compensation for the anticipated reduction in the real value of the $10 million principal; only $.4 million is  real  interest expense. The \n$.6 million reduction in the purchasing power of the outstanding principal may be thought of as repayment of principal, rather than as an interest expense. Real income of the firm is, therefore, understated by $.6 million.  Example 19.5 Inflation and Real Income \n In a period of rapid inflation, companies ABC and XYZ have the same  reported  earnings. ABC uses LIFO \ninventory accounting, has relatively fewer depreciable assets, and has more debt than XYZ. XYZ uses \nFIFO inventory accounting. Which company has the higher  real  income, and why?  CONCEPT CHECK 19.5 \n  Fair Value Accounting \n Many major assets and liabilities are not traded in financial markets and do not have eas-\nily observable values. For example, we cannot simply look up the values of employee stock options, health care benefits for retired employees, or buildings and other real estate. While the true financial status of a firm may depend critically on these values, which can swing widely over time, common practice has been to simply value them at historic cost. Proponents of    fair value accounting,      also known as    mark-to-market accounting,      argue \nthat financial statements would give a truer picture of the firm if they better reflected the current market values of all assets and liabilities. \n The Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Statement No. 157 on fair value account-\ning places assets in one of three \u201cbuckets.\u201d Level 1 assets are traded in active markets and therefore should be valued at their market price. Level 2 assets are not actively traded, but their values still may be estimated using observable market data on similar assets. They can be \u201cmarked to a matrix\u201d of comparable securities. Level 3 assets are hardest to value. Here it is difficult even to identify other assets that are similar enough to serve as benchmarks for their market values; one has to resort to pricing models to estimate their intrinsic values. Rather than mark to market, these values are often called \u201cmark to model,\u201d although they are also disparagingly known as mark-to-make believe, as the estimates are so prone to manipulation by creative use of model inputs. Since 2012, firms have been required to disclose more about the methods and assumptions used in their valuation models and to describe the sensitivity of their valuation estimates to changes in their methodology.  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   660bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   660 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 661\n  6 D.

Mark-to-Market Accounting: Cure or Disease? \n As banks and other institutions holding mortgage-backed \nsecurities revalued their portfolios throughout 2008, their net worth fell along with the value of those securities. The losses on these securities were painful enough, but their knock-on effects only increased the banks\u2019 woes. For example, banks are required to maintain adequate levels of capital relative to assets. If capital reserves decline, a bank may be forced to shrink until its remaining capital is once again adequate compared to its asset base. But such shrinkage may require the bank to cut back on its lending, which restricts its customers\u2019 access to credit. It may also require asset sales, and if many banks attempt to shrink their portfolios at once, waves of forced sales may put fur-ther pressure on prices, resulting in additional write-downs and reductions to capital in a self-feeding cycle. Critics of mark-to-market accounting therefore contend that it exac-erbated the problems of an already reeling economy. \n Advocates, however, argue that the critics confuse the \nmessage with the messenger. Mark-to-market accounting \nmakes transparent losses that have already been incurred, but it does not cause those losses. Critics retort that when markets are faltering, market prices may be unreliable. If trading activity has largely broken down, and assets can be sold only at fire-sale prices, then those prices may no longer be indicative of fundamental value. Markets can-not be efficient if they are not even functioning. In the turmoil surrounding the defaulted mortgages weighing down bank portfolios, one of the early proposals of then\u2013Treasury secretary Henry Paulson was for the government to buy bad assets at \u201chold to maturity\u201d prices based on estimates of intrinsic value in a normally functioning mar-ket. In that spirit, FASB approved new guidelines in 2009 allowing valuation based on an estimate of the price that would prevail in an orderly market rather than the one that could be received in a forced liquidation. \n Waiving write-down requirements may best be viewed \nas thinly veiled regulatory forbearance. Regulators know \nthat losses have been incurred and that capital has been impaired. But by allowing firms to carry assets on their books at model rather than market prices, the unpleas-ant implications of that fact for capital adequacy may be politely ignored for a time. Even so, if the goal is to avoid forced sales in a distressed market, transparency may nev-ertheless be the best policy. Better to acknowledge losses and explicitly modify capital regulations to help institu-tions recover their footing in a difficult economy than to deal with losses by ignoring them. After all, why bother preparing financial statements if they are allowed to obscure the true condition of the firm? \n Before abandoning fair value accounting, it would be \nprudent to consider the alternative. Traditional historic-\ncost accounting, which would allow firms to carry assets on the books at their original purchase price, has even less to recommend it. It would leave investors without an accu-rate sense of the condition of shaky institutions, and by the same token lessen the pressure on those firms to get their houses in order. Dealing with losses must surely require acknowledging them.   WORDS FROM THE STREET \n Critics of fair value accounting argue that it relies too heavily on estimates. Such esti-\nmates potentially introduce considerable noise in firms\u2019 accounts and can induce great \nprofit volatility as fluctuations in asset valuations are recognized. Even worse, subjective valuations may offer management a tempting tool to manipulate earnings or the appar-ent financial condition of the firm at opportune times. As just one example, Bergstresser, Desai, and Rauh  \n6   find that firms make more aggressive assumptions about returns on \ndefined benefit pension plans (which lowers the computed present value of pension obliga-tions) during periods in which executives are actively exercising their stock options.\n  \n A contentious debate over the application of fair value accounting to troubled financial \ninstitutions erupted in 2008 when even values of financial securities such as subprime mortgage pools and derivative contracts backed by these pools came into question as trad-ing in these instruments dried up. Without well-functioning markets, estimating (much less observing) market values was, at best, a precarious exercise. In 2012, for example, employees at Credit Suisse were convicted of intentionally overstating the value of thinly traded mortgage bonds during the financial crisis to improve the apparent profitability of their trading activities. \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   661bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   661 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n662 PART V  Security Analysis\n Many observers feel that mark-to-market accounting exacerbated the financial melt-\ndown by forcing banks to excessively write down asset values; others feel that a failure to \nmark would have been tantamount to willfully ignoring reality and abdicating the respon-sibility to redress problems at nearly or already insolvent banks. The nearby box discusses the debate.  \n  Quality of Earnings and Accounting Practices \n Many firms will make accounting choices that present their financial statements in the best possible light. The different choices that firms can make give rise to the comparabil-ity problems we have discussed. As a result, earnings statements for different companies may be more or less rosy presentations of true economic earnings\u2014sustainable cash flow that can be paid to shareholders without impairing the firm\u2019s productive capacity. Analysts commonly evaluate the    quality of earnings    reported by a firm. This concept refers to the \nrealism and conservatism of the earnings number, in other words, the extent to which we might expect the reported level of earnings to be sustained. \n Examples of the types of factors that influence quality of earnings are:\n    \u2022   Allowance for bad debt.  Most firms sell goods using trade credit and must make \nan allowance for bad debt. An unrealistically low allowance reduces the quality of reported earnings.  \n   \u2022   Nonrecurring items.  Some items that affect earnings should not be expected to \nrecur regularly. These include asset sales, effects of accounting changes, effects of exchange rate movements, or unusual investment income. For example, in years with large stock market returns, some firms enjoy large capital gains on securities held. These contribute to that year\u2019s earnings, but should not be expected to repeat regularly. They would be considered a \u201clow-quality\u201d component of earnings. Similarly, investment gains in corporate pension plans generated large but one-off contributions to reported earnings.  \n   \u2022   Earnings smoothing.  In 2003, Freddie Mac was the subject of an accounting \nscandal, when it emerged that it had improperly reclassified mortgages held in its portfolio in an attempt to  reduce  its current earnings. Why would it take such \nactions? Because later, if earnings turned down, Freddie could \u201crelease\u201d earnings by reversing these transactions, and thereby create the appearance of steady earnings growth. Indeed, almost until its sudden collapse in 2008, Freddie Mac\u2019s nickname on Wall Street was \u201cSteady Freddie.\u201d Similarly, in the four quarters ending in October 2012, the four largest U.S. banks released $18.2 billion in reserves, which accounted for nearly one-quarter of their pretax income.  \n7   Such \n\u201cearnings\u201d are clearly not sustainable over the long-term and therefore must be considered low quality.\n  \n   \u2022   Revenue recognition.  Under GAAP accounting, a firm is allowed to recognize a \nsale before it is paid. This is why firms have accounts receivable. But sometimes it can be hard to know when to recognize sales. For example, suppose a computer firm signs a contract to provide products and services over a 5-year period. Should the projected revenue be booked immediately or spread out over 5 years? A more extreme version of this problem is called \u201cchannel stuffing,\u201d \n 7 Michael Rapoport, \u201cBank Profit Spigot to Draw Scrutiny,\u201d  The Wall Street Journal,  October 11, 2012.\nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   662bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   662 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 663\nin which firms \u201csell\u201d large quantities of goods to customers, but give them the \nright to later either refuse delivery or return the product. The revenue from the \u201csale\u201d is booked now, but the likely returns are not recognized until they occur (in a future accounting period). Hewlett-Packard argued in 2012 that it was led to overpay for its acquisition of Autonomy Corp. when Autonomy artificially enhanced its financial performance using channel stuffing. For example, Autonomy apparently sold software valued at over \u00a34\u00a0billion to Tikit Group; it booked the entire deal as revenue but would not be paid until Tikit actually sold software to its clients.  \n8   Thus, several years\u2019 worth of only tentative future sales \nwas recognized in 2010.    \n If you see accounts receivable increasing far faster than sales, or becoming a \nlarger percentage of total assets, beware of these practices. Given the wide latitude firms have in how they recognize revenue, many analysts choose instead to concen-trate on cash flow, which is far harder for a company to manipulate.  \n   \u2022   Off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities.  Suppose that one firm guarantees the \noutstanding debt of another firm, perhaps a firm in which it has an ownership stake. That obligation ought to be disclosed as a  contingent liability,  because it \nmay require payments down the road. But these obligations may not be reported as part of the firm\u2019s outstanding debt. Similarly, leasing may be used to manage off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities. Airlines, for example, may show no aircraft on their balance sheets but have long-term leases that are virtually equivalent to debt-financed ownership. However, if the leases are treated as operating rather than capital leases, they may appear only as footnotes to the financial statements.     \n  International Accounting Conventions \n The examples cited above illustrate some of the problems that analysts can encounter when attempting to interpret financial data. Even greater problems arise in the interpretation of the financial statements of foreign firms. This is because these firms do not follow GAAP guidelines. Accounting practices in various countries differ to greater or lesser extents from U.S. standards. Here are some of the major issues that you should be aware of when using the financial statements of foreign firms:\n    \u2022   Reserving practices.  Many countries allow firms considerably more discretion \nin setting aside reserves for future contingencies than is typical in the United States. Because additions to reserves result in a charge against income, reported earnings are far more subject to managerial discretion than in the United States.  \n   \u2022   Depreciation.  In the United States, firms typically maintain separate sets of \naccounts for tax and reporting purposes. For example, accelerated depreciation is typically used for tax purposes, whereas straight-line depreciation is used for reporting purposes. In contrast, most other countries do not allow dual sets of accounts, and most firms in foreign countries use accelerated depreciation to minimize taxes despite the fact that it results in lower reported earnings.

Treatment of intangibles such as goodwill can vary widely. Are they \namortized or expensed? If amortized, over what period? Such issues can have a \nlarge impact on reported profits.    \n The effect of different accounting practices can be substantial.  Figure 19.4  compares \nP/E ratios in different countries as reported and restated on a common basis. While P/E \nmultiples have changed considerably since this study was published, these results illustrate \nhow different accounting rules can have a big impact on these ratios.  \n Some of the differences between U.S. and European accounting standards arise from \ndifferent philosophies regarding regulating accounting practice. GAAP accounting in the \nU.S. is rules-based, with detailed, explicit, and lengthy rules governing almost any circum-\nstance that can be anticipated. In contrast, the    international financial reporting standards    \n(IFRS) used in the European Union are principles-based, setting out general approaches \nfor the preparation of financial statements. While EU rules are more flexible, firms must be \nprepared to demonstrate that their accounting choices are consistent with IFRS principles. \n IFRS seem on their way to becoming global standards, even outside of the European \nUnion. By 2008, over 100 countries had adopted them, and they are making inroads even \nin the United States. In November 2007, the SEC began allowing foreign firms to issue \nsecurities in the U.S. if their financial statements are prepared using IFRS. In 2008, the \nSEC went even further when it proposed allowing large U.S. multinational firms to report \nearnings using IFRS rather than GAAP starting in 2010. A final integration of U.S. rules \nwith IFRS has been long expected but repeatedly delayed. However, even without formal \nadoption of IFRS, the widespread belief is that the U.S. will continue to change GAAP \nover time to more closely conform to IFRS rules. The goal is to make cross-border financial \nstatements more consistent and comparable, thereby improving the quality of  information \navailable to investors.    \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   664bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   664 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 665\n  9 As cited by John Train in  Money Masters  (New York: Harper & Row, 1987). \n     1 .   The primary focus of the security analyst should be the firm\u2019s real economic earnings rather than \nits reported earnings. Accounting earnings as reported in financial statements can be a biased esti-mate of real economic earnings, although empirical studies reveal that reported earnings convey considerable information concerning a firm\u2019s prospects.  \n    2 .   A firm\u2019s ROE is a key determinant of the growth rate of its earnings. ROE is affected profoundly by the firm\u2019s degree of financial leverage. An increase in a firm\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio will raise its ROE and hence its growth rate only if the interest rate on the debt is less than the firm\u2019s return on assets.     SUMMARY  No presentation of fundamental security analysis would be complete without a discussion \nof the ideas of Benjamin Graham, the greatest of the investment \u201cgurus.\u201d Until the evolu-tion of modern portfolio theory in the latter half of the 20th century, Graham was the single most important thinker, writer, and teacher in the field of investment analysis. His influ-ence on investment professionals remains very strong. \n Graham\u2019s magnum opus is  Security Analysis,  written with Columbia Professor David \nDodd in 1934. Its message is similar to the ideas presented in this chapter. Graham believed careful analysis of a firm\u2019s financial statements could turn up bargain stocks. Over the years, he developed many different rules for determining the most important financial ratios and the critical values for judging a stock to be undervalued. Through many editions, his book has been so influential and successful that widespread adoption of Graham\u2019s tech-niques has led to the elimination of the very bargains they are designed to identify. \n In a 1976 seminar Graham said:  \n9    \n  I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find \nsuperior value opportunities. This was a rewarding activity, say, forty years ago, when our textbook \u201cGraham and Dodd\u201d was first published; but the situation has changed a good deal since then. In the old days any well-trained security analyst could do a good professional job of selecting undervalued issues through detailed studies; but in the light of the enormous amount of research now being carried on, I doubt whether in most cases such extensive efforts will generate sufficiently superior selections to justify their cost. To that very limited extent I\u2019m on the side of the \u201cefficient market\u201d school of thought now generally accepted by the professors.  \n Nonetheless, in that same seminar, Graham suggested a simplified approach to identify-\ning bargain stocks: \n  My first, more limited, technique confines itself to the purchase of common stocks at less than their working-capital value, or net current-asset value, giving no weight to the plant and other fixed assets, and deducting all liabilities in full from the current assets. We used this approach extensively in managing investment funds, and over a 30-odd-year period we must have earned an average of some 20 percent per year from this source. I consider it a foolproof method of systematic investment\u2014once again, not on the basis of individual results but in terms of the expectable group income.  \n There are two convenient sources of information for those interested in trying out the \nGraham technique: Both Standard & Poor\u2019s  Outlook  and  The Value Line Investment Survey  \ncarry lists of stocks selling below net working capital value.       19.7 Value Investing: The Graham Technique  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   665bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   665 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm666 PART V  Security Analysis\n    3.  It is often helpful to the analyst to decompose a firm\u2019s ROE ratio into the product of several \naccounting ratios and to analyze their separate behavior over time and across companies within an industry. A useful breakdown is   \nROE5Net pro\nfits\nPretax profits3Pretax pro fits\nEBIT3EBIT\nSales3Sales\nAssets3Assets\nEquity   \n    4.  Other accounting ratios that have a bearing on a firm\u2019s profitability and/or risk are fixed-asset turnover, inventory turnover, days sales in receivables, and the current, quick, and interest  coverage ratios.  \n    5.  Two ratios that make use of the market price of the firm\u2019s common stock in addition to its finan-cial statements are the ratios of market to book value and price to earnings. Analysts sometimes take low values for these ratios as a margin of safety or a sign that the stock is a bargain.  \n    6.  Good firms are not necessarily good investments. Stock market prices of successful firms may be bid up to levels that reflect that success. If so, the price of these firms relative to their earn-ings prospects may not constitute a bargain.  \n    7.  A major problem in the use of data obtained from a firm\u2019s financial statements is comparabil-ity. Firms have a great deal of latitude in how they choose to compute various items of revenue and expense. It is, therefore, necessary for the security analyst to adjust accounting earnings and financial ratios to a uniform standard before attempting to compare financial results across firms.  \n    8.  Comparability problems can be acute in a period of inflation. Inflation can create distortions in accounting for inventories, depreciation, and interest expense.  \n    9.  Fair value or mark-to-market accounting requires that most assets be valued at current market value rather than historical cost. This policy has proved to be controversial because ascertaining true market value in many instances is difficult, and critics contend that financial statements are therefore unduly volatile. Advocates argue that financial statements should reflect the best estimate of current asset values.  \n    10.  International financial reporting standards have become progressively accepted throughout the world, including the United States. They differ from traditional U.S. GAAP procedures in that they are principles-based rather than rules-based.

Hatfield is cur-rently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for accounting irregu-larities and possible legal violations in the presentation of the company\u2019s financial statements. A due diligence team from the SEC has been sent to Hatfield\u2019s corporate headquarters in Philadelphia for a complete audit in order to further assess the situation. \n Several unique circumstances at Hatfield are discovered by the SEC due diligence team during \nthe course of the investigation:\n   \u2022  Management has been involved in ongoing negotiations with the local labor union, of \nwhich approximately 40% of its full-time labor force are members. Labor offi  cials are \nseeking increased wages and pension benefi  ts, which Hatfi  eld\u2019s management states is not possible at this time due to decreased profi  tability and a tight cash fl  ow situation. \nLabor offi  cials have accused Hatfi  eld\u2019s management of manipulating the company\u2019s fi nancial statements to justify not granting any concessions during the course of \n negotiations.  \n  \u2022  All new equipment obtained over the past several years has been established on \n Hatfi eld\u2019s books as operating leases, although past acquisitions of similar equipment \nwere nearly always classifi  ed as capital leases.

Initial review of Hatfield\u2019s financial statements indicates that at a minimum, certain practices \nhave resulted in low-quality earnings.  \n   9. Labor officials believe that the management of Hatfield is attempting to understate its net \nincome to avoid making any concessions in the labor negotiations. Which of the following \nactions by management will  most likely  result in low-quality earnings?\n     a.  Lengthening the life of a depreciable asset in order to lower the depreciation expense.      b.  Lowering the discount rate used in the valuation of the company\u2019s pension obligations.  \n    c.  The recognition of revenue at the time of delivery rather than when payment is received.     \n   10. Hatfield has begun recording all new equipment leases on its books as operating leases, a change \nfrom its consistent past use of capital leases, in which the present value of lease payments is classified as a debt obligation. What is the  most likely  motivation behind Hatfield\u2019s change in \naccounting methodology? Hatfield is attempting to:\n     a.  Improve its leverage ratios and reduce its perceived leverage.  \n    b.  Reduce its cost of goods sold and increase its profitability.  \n    c.  Increase its operating margins relative to industry peers.     \n   11. The SEC due diligence team is searching for the reason behind Hatfield\u2019s inventory build-up \nrelative to its sales growth. One way to identify a deliberate manipulation of financial results by Hatfield is to search for:\n     a.  A decline in inventory turnover.  \n    b.

After describing the electric toothbrush industry, her \nfirst report focuses on two companies, QuickBrush Company and SmileWhite Corporation, and concludes:\n  QuickBrush is a more profitable company than SmileWhite, as indicated by the \n40% sales growth and substantially higher margins it has produced over the last few years. SmileWhite\u2019s sales and earnings are growing at a 10% rate and pro-duce much lower margins. We do not think SmileWhite is capable of growing faster than its recent growth rate of 10% whereas QuickBrush can sustain a 30% long-term growth rate.  \n     a.  Criticize Ludlow\u2019s analysis and conclusion that QuickBrush is more profitable, as defined by \nreturn on equity (ROE), than SmileWhite and that it has a higher sustainable growth rate. Use \nonly the information provided in  Tables 19A  and  19B . Support your criticism by calculating and analyzing:  \n   \u2022  The fi  ve components that determine ROE.  \n  \u2022  The two ratios that determine sustainable growth: ROE and plowback.     \n    b.  Explain how QuickBrush has produced an average annual earnings per share (EPS) growth \nrate of 40% over the last 2 years with an ROE that has been declining. Use only the informa-\ntion provided in  Table 19A .    \n  Use the following in answering CFA Problems 5\u20138:   Eastover Company (EO) is a large, diversified \nforest products company. Approximately 75% of its sales are from paper and forest products, with the remainder from financial services and real estate. The company owns 5.6 million acres of timber-land, which is carried at very low historical cost on the balance sheet. \n Peggy Mulroney, CFA, is an analyst at the investment counseling firm of Centurion Investments. \nShe is assigned the task of assessing the outlook for Eastover, which is being considered for pur-chase, and comparing it to another forest products company in Centurion\u2019s portfolios, Southampton Corporation (SHC). SHC is a major producer of lumber products in the United States. Building products, primarily lumber and plywood, account for 89% of SHC\u2019s sales, with pulp accounting for the remainder. SHC owns 1.4 million acres of timberland, which is also carried at historical cost on the balance sheet. In SHC\u2019s case, however, that cost is not as far below current market as Eastover\u2019s. \n Mulroney began her examination of Eastover and Southampton by looking at the five compo-\nnents of return on equity (ROE) for each company. For her analysis, Mulroney elected to define equity as total shareholders\u2019 equity, including preferred stock. She also elected to use year-end data rather than averages for the balance sheet items.  \nbod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   670bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd   670 7/17/13   4:13 PM7/17/13   4:13 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 671\n   5 .      a.  On the basis of the data shown in  Tables 19C  and  19D , calculate each of the five ROE compo-\nnents for Eastover and Southampton in 2013. Using the five components, calculate ROE for \nboth companies in 2013.    \n    b.  Referring to the components calculated in part ( a ), explain the difference in ROE for Eastover \nand Southampton in 2013.  \n    c.

Mulroney recalled from her CFA studies that the constant-growth discounted dividend model \nwas one way to arrive at a valuation for a company\u2019s common stock. She collected current \ndividend and stock price data for Eastover and Southampton, shown in  Table 19E . Using 11% as the required rate of return (i.e., discount rate) and a projected growth rate of 8%, com-pute a constant-growth DDM value for Eastover\u2019s stock and compare the computed value for  Eastover to its stock price indicated in  Table 19F .    \n    b.

Discuss advantages and disadvantages of using a constant-growth DDM. Briefly discuss how \nthe two-stage DDM improves upon the constant-growth DDM.     \n   7. In addition to the discounted dividend model approach, Mulroney decided to look at the price\u2013\nearnings ratio and price\u2013book ratio, relative to the S&P 500, for both Eastover and Southampton. Mulroney elected to perform this analysis using 2010\u20132014 and current data.\n     a.  Using the data in  Tables 19E  and  19F , compute both the current and the 5-year (2010\u20132014)  \naverage relative price\u2013earnings ratios and relative price\u2013book ratios for Eastover and \n Southampton (i.e., ratios relative to those for the S&P 500).

Its earnings yield was \n25% compared with an industry average of 12.5%. \n Note that in our calculations P/E does not equal (P/B)/ROE because (following common prac-\ntice) we have computed ROE with  average  shareholders\u2019 equity in the denominator and P/B with \n end -of-year shareholders\u2019 equity in the denominator.  \n   4 .  \n  ROE increased despite a decline in operating margin and a decline in the tax burden ratio because of \nincreased leverage and turnover. Note that ROA declined from 11.65% in 2013 to 10.65% in 2015.  \n   5. LIFO accounting results in lower reported earnings than does FIFO. Fewer assets to depreciate \nresult in lower reported earnings because there is less bias associated with the use of historic cost. \nMore debt results in lower reported earnings because the inflation premium in the interest rate is treated as part of interest expense and not as repayment of principal. If ABC has the same reported earnings as XYZ despite these three sources of downward bias, its real earnings must be greater.

These \nare securities whose prices are determined by, or \u201cderive from,\u201d the prices of other securities. \n Options and futures contracts are both \nderivative securities. Their payoffs depend on \nthe value of other securities. Swaps, which we will discuss in Chapter 23, also are derivatives. Because the value of derivatives depends on the value of other securities, they can be powerful tools for both hedging and specula-tion. We will investigate these applications in the next four chapters, starting in this chapter with options. \n Trading of standardized options contracts \non a national exchange started in 1973 when \nthe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) began listing call options. These contracts were almost immediately a great success, crowding out the previously existing over-the-counter options market. \n Option contracts are traded now on several \nexchanges. They are written on common stock, \nstock indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, precious metals, and interest rate futures. In addition, the over-the-counter market has enjoyed a tremendous resurgence in recent years as trading in custom-tailored options has exploded. Popular and potent tools in modifying portfolio characteristics, options have become essential tools a port-folio manager must understand. \n This chapter is an introduction to options \nmarkets. It explains how puts and calls work \nand examines their investment characteris-tics. Popular option strategies are considered next. Finally, we examine a range of securities with embedded options such as callable or convertible bonds, and we take a quick look at some so-called exotic options.   CHAPTER TWENTY 2 Options Markets: \nIntroduction  PART VI \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   678bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   678 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 679\n  A     call option    gives its holder the right to purchase an asset for a specified price, called \nthe    exercise    ,   or    strike, price    ,   on or before some specified expiration date. For example, \na February call option on IBM stock with exercise price $195 entitles its owner to purchase IBM stock for a price of $195 at any time up to and including the expiration date in February. The holder of the call is not required to exercise the option. She will choose to exercise only if the market value of the underlying asset exceeds the exercise price. In that case, the option holder may \u201ccall away\u201d the asset for the exercise price. Otherwise, the option may be left unexercised. If it is not exercised before the expira-tion date of the contract, a call option simply expires and becomes valueless. Therefore, if the stock price is greater than the exercise price on the expiration date, the value of the call option equals the difference between the stock price and the exercise price; but if the stock price is less than the exercise price at expiration, the call will be worthless. The  net profit  on the call is the value of the option minus the price originally paid to \npurchase it. \n The purchase price of the option is called the    premium    .  It represents the compensation \nthe purchaser of the call must pay for the right to exercise the option only when exercise is desirable. \n Sellers of call options, who are said to  write  calls, receive premium income now as pay-\nment against the possibility they will be required at some later date to deliver the asset in return for an exercise price less than the market value of the asset. If the option is left to expire worthless, the writer of the call clears a profit equal to the premium income derived from the initial sale of the option. But if the call is exercised, the profit to the option writer is the premium income  minus  the difference between the value of the stock that must be \ndelivered and the exercise price that is paid for those shares. If that difference is larger than the initial premium, the writer will incur a loss. \n     20.1 The Option Contract \n Consider the February 2013 expiration call option on a share of IBM with an exercise \nprice of $195 selling on January 18, 2013, for $3.65. Exchange-traded options expire on the third Friday of the expiration month, which for this option was February 15. Until the expiration date, the call holder may buy shares of IBM for $195. On January 18, IBM sells for $194.47. Because the stock price is only $194.47, it clearly would not make sense at the moment to exercise the option to buy at $195. Indeed, if IBM remains below $195 by the expiration date, the call will be left to expire worthless. On the other hand, if IBM is selling above $195 at expiration, the call holder will find it optimal to exercise. For example, if IBM sells for $197 on February 15, the option will be exercised, as it will give its holder the right to pay $195 for a stock worth $197. The value of each option on the expiration date would then be   \nValue at expiration 5 Stock price 2 Exercise price 5 $197 2 $195 5 $2  \n Despite the $2 payoff at expiration, the call holder still realizes a loss of $1.65 on the \ninvestment because the initial purchase price was $3.65:   \nProfit 5 Final value 2 Original investment 5 $2.00 2 $3.65 5 2$1.65   Example 20.1 Profits and Losses on a Call Option \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   679bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   679 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n680 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n A    put option    gives its holder the right to  sell  an asset for a specified exercise or strike \nprice on or before some expiration date. A February expiration put on IBM with an exer-\ncise price of $195 entitles its owner to sell IBM stock to the put writer at a price of $195 at any time before expiration in February even if the market price of IBM is less than $195. Whereas profits on call options increase when the asset price rises, profits on put options increase when the asset price  falls.  A put will be exercised only if the exercise price is \ngreater than the price of the underlying asset, that is, only if its holder can deliver for the exercise price an asset with market value less than that amount. (One doesn\u2019t need to own the shares of IBM to exercise the IBM put option. Upon exercise, the investor\u2019s broker purchases the necessary shares of IBM at the market price and immediately delivers, or \u201cputs them,\u201d to an option writer for the exercise price. The owner of the put profits by the difference between the exercise price and market price.)  \n Now consider the February 2013 expiration put option on IBM with an exercise \nprice of $195, selling on January 18 for $5.00. It entitled its owner to sell a share of IBM for $195 at any time until February 15. If the holder of the put buys a share of IBM and immediately exercises the right to sell it at $195, net proceeds will be $195\u00a0 2 \u00a0$194.47\u00a0 5 \u00a0$.53. Obviously, an investor who pays $5 for the put has no inten-\ntion of exercising it immediately. If, on the other hand, IBM were selling for $188 at \nexpiration, the put would turn out to be a profitable investment. Its value at expiration would be   \nValue at expiration 5 Exercise price 2 Stock price 5 $195 2 $188 5 $7  \n and the investor\u2019s profit would be $7\u00a0 2 \u00a0$5\u00a0 5 \u00a0$2. This is a holding period return of \n$2/$5\u00a0 5 \u00a0.40, or 40%\u2014over only 28 days! Obviously, put option sellers on January 18 \n(who are on the other side of the transaction) did not consider this outcome very likely.  Example 20.2 Profits and Losses on a Put Option \n An option is described as    in the money    when its exercise would produce a positive \ncash flow. Therefore, a call option is in the money when the asset price is greater than \nthe exercise price, and a put option is in the money when the asset price is less than the exercise price. Conversely, a call is    out of the money    when the asset price is less than \nthe exercise price; no one would exercise the right to purchase for the strike price an asset worth less than that amount. A put option is out of the money when the exercise price is less than the asset price. Options are    at the money    when the exercise price and asset \nprice are equal.  Nevertheless, exercise of the call is optimal at expiration if the stock price exceeds the \nexercise price because the exercise proceeds will offset at least part of the purchase price. The call buyer will clear a profit if IBM is selling above $198.65 at the expiration date. At that stock price, the proceeds from exercise will just cover the original cost of the call. \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   680bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   680 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 681\n  Options Trading \n Some options trade on over-the-counter markets. The OTC \nmarket offers the advantage that the terms of the option \ncontract\u2014the exercise price, expiration date, and number \nof shares committed\u2014can be tailored to the needs of the \ntraders. The costs of establishing an OTC option contract, \nhowever, are higher than for exchange-traded options. \n Options contracts traded on exchanges are standard-\nized by allowable expiration dates and exercise prices for \neach listed option. Each stock option contract provides \nfor the right to buy or sell 100 shares of stock (except \nwhen stock splits occur after the contract is listed and \nthe contract is adjusted for the terms of the split). \n Standardization of the terms of listed option contracts \nmeans all market participants trade in a limited and uni-\nform set of securities. This increases the depth of trad-\ning in any particular option, which lowers trading costs \nand results in a more competitive market. Exchanges, \ntherefore, offer two important benefits: ease of trading, \nwhich flows from a central marketplace where buy-\ners and sellers or their representatives congregate; and \na liquid secondary market where buyers and sellers of \noptions can transact quickly and cheaply. \n Until recently, most options trading in the United \nStates took place on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. However, by 2003 the Inter-\nnational Securities Exchange, an electronic exchange based in New York, displaced the \nCBOE as the largest options market. Options trading in Europe is uniformly transacted in \nelectronic exchanges. \n  Figure\u00a020.1  is a selection of listed stock option quotations for IBM. The last recorded \nprice on the New York Stock Exchange for IBM shares was $194.47 per share.  1   The exer-\ncise (or strike) prices bracket the stock price. While exercise prices generally are set at \nfive-point intervals, larger intervals sometimes are set for stocks selling above $100, and \nintervals of $2.50 may be used for stocks selling at low prices. If the stock price moves out-\nside the range of exercise prices of the existing set of options, new options with appropriate \nexercise prices may be offered. Therefore, at any time, both in-the-money and out-of-the-\nmoney options will be listed, as in this example.    \n  Figure\u00a020.1  shows both call and put options listed for each expiration date and exercise \nprice. The three sets of columns for each option report closing price, trading volume in \ncontracts, and open interest (number of outstanding contracts). When we compare prices \nof call options with the same expiration date but different exercise prices in  Figure\u00a020.1 , \nwe see that the value of a call is lower when the exercise price is higher. This makes sense, \nbecause the right to purchase a share at a lower exercise price is more valuable than the \nright to purchase at a higher price. Thus the February expiration IBM call option with \nstrike price $195 sells for $3.65 whereas the $200 exercise price February call sells for \n1 Occasionally, this price may not match the closing price listed for the stock on the stock market page. This is \nbecause some NYSE stocks also trade on exchanges that close after the NYSE, and the stock pages may reflect \nthe more recent closing price. The options exchanges, however, close with the NYSE, so the closing NYSE stock \nprice is appropriate for comparison with the closing option price.

Conversely, put options are worth  more  when the exercise price is higher: You \nwould rather have the right to sell shares for $200 than for $195 and this is reflected in \nthe prices of the puts. The February expiration put option with strike price $200 sells for $8.09, whereas the $195 exercise price February put sells for only $5. \n If an option does not trade on a given day, three dots will appear in the volume and price \ncolumns. Because trading is infrequent, it is not unusual to find option prices that appear out of line with other prices. You might see, for example, two calls with different exercise prices that seem to sell for the same price. This discrepancy arises because the last trades for these options may have occurred at different times during the day. At any moment, the call with the lower exercise price must be worth more than an otherwise-identical call with a higher exercise price. \n Expirations of most exchange-traded options tend to be fairly short, ranging up to only \nseveral months. For larger firms and several stock indexes, however, longer-term options are traded with expirations ranging up to several years. These options are called LEAPS (for  L ong- T erm  E quity  A ntici P ation  S ecurities). \n  \n     a.  What will be the proceeds and net profits to an investor who purchases the February expiration IBM \ncalls with exercise price $195 if the stock price at expiration is $205? What if the stock price at expira-tion is $185?  \n    b.  Now answer part ( a ) for an investor who purchases a February expiration IBM put option with exercise \nprice $195.    CONCEPT CHECK 20.1 \n  American and European Options \n An    American option    allows its holder to exercise the right to purchase (if a call) or sell (if \na put) the underlying asset on  or before  the expiration date.    European options    allow for \nexercise of the option only on the expiration date. American options, because they allow more leeway than their European counterparts, generally will be more valuable. Virtually all traded options in the United States are American style. Foreign currency options and stock index options are notable exceptions to this rule, however.  \n  Adjustments in Option Contract Terms \n Because options convey the right to buy or sell shares at a stated price, stock splits would radically alter their value if the terms of the options contract were not adjusted to account for the stock split. For example, reconsider the IBM call options in  Figure\u00a020.1 . If IBM were to announce a 2-for-1 split, its share price would fall from about $195 to about $97.50. A call option with exercise price $195 would be just about worthless, with virtu-ally no possibility that the stock would sell at more than $195 before the options expired. \n To account for a stock split, the exercise price is reduced by a factor of the split, and the \nnumber of options held is increased by that factor. For example, each original call option with exercise price of $195 would be altered after a 2-for-1 split to two new options, with each new option carrying an exercise price of $97.50. A similar adjustment is made for stock dividends of more than 10%; the number of shares covered by each option is increased in proportion to the stock dividend, and the exercise price is reduced by that proportion. \n In contrast to stock dividends, cash dividends do not affect the terms of an option con-\ntract. Because payment of a cash dividend reduces the selling price of the stock without \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   682bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   682 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 683\ninducing offsetting adjustments in the option contract, the value of the option is affected by \ndividend policy. Other things being equal, call option values are lower for high-dividend payout policies, because such policies slow the rate of increase of stock prices; conversely, put values are higher for high-dividend payouts. (Of course, the option values do not nec-essarily rise or fall on the dividend payment or ex-dividend dates. Dividend payments are anticipated, so the effect of the payment already is built into the original option price.) \n  \n Suppose that IBM\u2019s stock price at the exercise date is $200, and the exercise price of the call is $195. What is \nthe payoff on one option contract? After a 2-for-1 split, the stock price is $100, the exercise price is $97.50, and the option holder now can purchase 200 shares. Show that the split leaves the payoff from the option unaffected.  CONCEPT CHECK 20.2 \n  The Options Clearing Corporation \n The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), the clearinghouse for options trading, is jointly \nowned by the exchanges on which stock options are traded. Buyers and sellers of options who agree on a price will strike a deal. At this point, the OCC steps in. The OCC places itself between the two traders, becoming the effective buyer of the option from the writer and the effective writer of the option to the buyer. All individuals, therefore, deal only with the OCC, which effectively guarantees contract performance. \n When an option holder exercises an option, the OCC arranges for a member firm with \nclients who have written that option to make good on the option obligation. The mem-ber firm selects from its clients who have written that option to fulfill the contract. The selected client must deliver 100 shares of stock at a price equal to the exercise price for each call option contract written or must purchase 100 shares at the exercise price for each put option contract written. \n Because the OCC guarantees contract performance, it requires option writers to post \nmargin to guarantee that they can fulfill their contract obligations. The margin required is determined in part by the amount by which the option is in the money, because that value is an indicator of the potential obligation of the option writer. When the required margin exceeds the posted margin, the writer will receive a margin call. In contrast, the holder of the option need not post margin because the holder will exercise the option only if it is profitable to do so. After purchase of the option, no further money is at risk. \n Margin requirements are determined in part by the other securities held in the investor\u2019s \nportfolio. For example, a call option writer owning the stock against which the option is written can satisfy the margin requirement simply by allowing a broker to hold that stock in the brokerage account. The stock is then guaranteed to be available for delivery should the call option be exercised. If the underlying security is not owned, however, the margin requirement is determined by the value of the underlying security as well as by the amount by which the option is in or out of the money. Out-of-the-money options require less mar-gin from the writer, for expected payouts are lower.  \n  Other Listed Options \n Options on assets other than stocks are also widely traded. These include options on mar-ket indexes and industry indexes, on foreign currency, and even on the futures prices of agricultural products, gold, silver, fixed-income securities, and stock indexes. We will dis-cuss these in turn. \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   683bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   683 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n684 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n  Index Options   An index option is a call or put based on a stock market index such \nas the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ 100. Index options are traded on several broad-based \nindexes as well as on several industry-specific indexes and even commodity price indexes. We discussed many of these indexes in Chapter 2. \n The construction of the indexes can vary across contracts or exchanges. For example, \nthe S&P 100 index is a value-weighted average of the 100 stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 100 stock group. The weights are proportional to the market value of outstanding equity for each stock. The Dow Jones Industrial Index, by contrast, is a price-weighted average of 30 stocks. \n Option contracts on many foreign stock indexes also trade. For example, options on \nthe (Japanese) Nikkei Stock Index trade on the Singapore as well as the Chicago Mercan-tile Exchange. Options on European indexes such as the Financial Times Share Exchange (FTSE 100) trade on the NYSE-Euronext Exchange. The Chicago Board Options Exchange also lists options on industry indexes such as the oil or high-tech industries. \n In contrast to stock options, index options do not require that the call writer actually \n\u201cdeliver the index\u201d upon exercise or that the put writer \u201cpurchase the index.\u201d Instead, a cash settlement procedure is used. The payoff that would accrue upon exercise of the option is calculated, and the option writer simply pays that amount to the option holder. The payoff is equal to the difference between the exercise price of the option and the value of the index. For example, if the S&P index is at 1400 when a call option on the index with exercise price 1390 is exercised, the holder of the call receives a cash pay-ment of the difference, 1400 2  1390, times the contract multiplier of $100, or $1,000 per \ncontract. \n Options on the major indexes, that is, the S&P 100 (often called the OEX after its \nticker symbol), the S&P 500 (the SPX), the NASDAQ 100 (the NDX), and the Dow Jones Industrials (the DJX), are the most actively traded contracts on the CBOE. Together, these contracts dominate CBOE volume.  \n  Futures Options   Futures options give their holders the right to buy or sell a speci-\nfied futures contract, using as a futures price the exercise price of the option. Although the \ndelivery process is slightly complicated, the terms of futures options contracts are designed in effect to allow the option to be written on the futures price itself. The option holder receives upon exercise a net payoff equal to the difference between the current futures price on the specified asset and the exercise price of the option. Thus if the futures price is, say, $37, and the call has an exercise price of $35, the holder who exercises the call option on the futures gets a payoff of $2.  \n  Foreign Currency Options   A currency option offers the right to buy or sell a \nquantity of foreign currency for a specified amount of domestic currency. Currency \noption contracts call for purchase or sale of the currency in exchange for a specified num-ber of U.S. dollars. Contracts are quoted in cents or fractions of a cent per unit of foreign currency. \n There is an important difference between currency options and currency  futures  options. \nThe former provide payoffs that depend on the difference between the exercise price and the exchange rate at expiration. The latter are foreign exchange futures options that provide payoffs that depend on the difference between the exercise price and the exchange rate  futures price  at expiration. Because exchange rates and exchange rate futures prices gener-\nally are not equal, the options and futures-options contracts will have different values, even with identical expiration dates and exercise prices. Trading volume in currency futures options dominates trading in currency options.  \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   684bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   684 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 685\n  Interest Rate Options   Options are traded on Treasury notes and bonds, Treasury \nbills, and government bonds of other major economies such as the U.K. or Japan. Options \non several interest rates also trade. Among these are contracts on Treasury bond, Treasury note, federal funds, LIBOR, Euribor,  \n2   and Eurodollar futures.       \n  2 The Euribor market is similar to the LIBOR market (see Chapter 2), but the interest rate charged in the Euribor \nmarket is the interbank rate for euro-denominated deposits.    Call Options \n Recall that a call option gives the right to purchase a security at the exercise price. Suppose you hold a call option on FinCorp stock with an exercise price of $100, and FinCorp is now selling at $110. You can exercise your option to purchase the stock at $100 and simultane-ously sell the shares at the market price of $110, clearing $10 per share. Yet if the shares sell below $100, you can sit on the option and do nothing, realizing no further gain or loss. The value of the call option at expiration equals   \nPayoff to call holder 5bS\nT2Xif ST.X\n0i f  ST#X  \n where  S   T   is the value of the stock at expiration and  X  is the exercise price. This formula \nemphasizes the option property because the payoff cannot be negative. The option is exer-\ncised only if  S   T   exceeds  X.  If  S   T   is less than  X,  the option expires with zero value. The loss \nto the option holder in this case equals the price originally paid for the option. More gen-\nerally, the  profit  to the option holder is the option payoff at expiration minus the original \npurchase price. \n The value at expiration of the call with exercise price $100 is given by the schedule: \nStock price: $90 $100 $110 $120 $130\nOption value: 0 0 10 20 30\n For stock prices at or below $100, the option is worthless. Above $100, the option is worth \nthe excess of the stock price over $100. The option\u2019s value increases by $1 for each dollar increase in the stock price. This relationship can be depicted graphically as in  Figure\u00a020.2 .  \n The solid line in  Figure\u00a020.2  is the value of the call at expiration. The net  profit  to the \nholder of the call equals the gross payoff less the initial investment in the call. Suppose the call cost $14. Then the profit to the call holder would be given by the dashed (bottom) line of  Figure\u00a020.2 . At option expiration, the investor suffers a loss of $14 if the stock price is less than or equal to $100. \n Profits do not become positive until the stock price at expiration exceeds $114. The break-\neven point is $114, because at that price the payoff to the call,  S  \n T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 X \u00a0 5 \u00a0$114\u00a0 2 \u00a0$100\u00a0 5 \u00a0$14, \nequals the initial cost of the call. \n Conversely, the writer of the call incurs losses if the stock price is high. In that scenario, \nthe writer will receive a call and will be obligated to deliver a stock worth  S   T   for only  X  \ndollars:   \nPayoff to call writer 5b2(ST2X)if ST.X\n0i f ST#X     20.2 Values of Options at Expiration \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   685bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   685 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n6 8 6 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n The call writer, who is exposed to losses \nif the stock price increases, is willing to bear \nthis risk in return for the option premium. \n  Figure\u00a0 20.3  depicts the payoff and profit \ndiagrams for the call writer. These are the \nmirror images of the corresponding diagrams \nfor call holders. The break-even point for the \noption writer also is $114. The (negative) pay-\noff at that point just offsets the premium origi-\nnally received when the option was written.   \n Put Options \n A put option is the right to sell an asset at \nthe exercise price. In this case, the holder \nwill not exercise the option unless the asset \nis worth  less  than the exercise price. For \nexample, if FinCorp shares were to fall to \n$90, a put option with exercise price $100 \ncould be exercised to clear $10 for its holder. The holder would purchase a share for $90 \nand simultaneously deliver it to the put option writer for the exercise price of $100. \n The value of a put option at expiration is   \nPayoff to put holder 5b0i f  ST$X\nX2STif ST,X  \n The solid line in  Figure\u00a020.4  illustrates the payoff at expiration to the holder of a put option \non FinCorp stock with an exercise price of $100. If the stock price at expiration is above \n$100, the put has no value, as the right to sell the shares at $100 would not be exercised. \nBelow a price of $100, the put value at expiration increases by $1 for each dollar the stock \nprice falls. The dashed line in  Figure\u00a020.4  is a graph of the put option owner\u2019s profit at \nexpiration, net of the initial cost of the put.  \n Writing puts  naked   (i.e., writing a put \nwithout an offsetting short position in the \nstock for hedging purposes) exposes the \nwriter to losses if the market falls. Writ-\ning naked, deep-out-of-the-money puts \nwas once considered an attractive way to \ngenerate income, as it was believed that \nas long as the market did not fall sharply \nbefore the option expiration, the option \npremium could be collected without the \nput holder ever exercising the option \nagainst the writer. Because only sharp \ndrops in the market could result in losses \nto the put writer, the strategy was not \nviewed as overly risky. However, in the \nwake of the market crash of October 1987, \nsuch put writers suffered huge losses. Par-\nticipants now perceive much greater risk to \nthis strategy. \n$30\nST\n80 90 100 110 120\nCost of OptionPro\ufb01tPayoff = Value at Expiration\n\u2212$14\u2212$100$10$20\n Figure 20.2 Payoff and profit to call option at expiration  \n$14\n0\n$100 $114\nPro\ufb01t\nPayoffST\n Figure 20.3 Payoff and profit to call writers at expiration  \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   686bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   686 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 687\n  Option versus Stock Investments \n Purchasing call options is a bullish strat-\negy; that is, the calls provide profits when \nstock prices increase. Purchasing puts, in \ncontrast, is a bearish strategy. Symmetri-\ncally, writing calls is bearish, whereas \nwriting puts is bullish. Because option val-\nues depend on the price of the underlying \nstock, purchase of options may be viewed \nas a substitute for direct purchase or sale of \na stock. Why might an option strategy be \npreferable to direct stock transactions? \n For example, why would you purchase a \ncall option rather than buy shares of stock \ndirectly? Maybe you have some informa-\ntion that leads you to believe the stock will \nincrease in value from its current level, \nwhich in our examples we will take to be \n$100. You know your analysis could be incorrect, however, and that shares also could \nfall in price. Suppose a 6-month maturity call option with exercise price $100 currently \nsells for $10, and the interest rate for the period is 3%. Consider these three strategies for \ninvesting a sum of money, say, $10,000. For simplicity, suppose the firm will not pay any \ndividends until after the 6-month period. \n   Strategy A: Invest entirely in stock. Buy 100 shares, each selling for $100.  \n  Strategy B: Invest entirely in at-the-money call options. Buy 1,000 calls, each selling \nfor $10. (This would require 10 contracts, each for 100 shares.)  \n  Strategy C: Purchase 100 call options for $1,000. Invest your remaining $9,000 in \n6-month T-bills, to earn 3% interest. The bills will grow in value from $9,000 to \n$9,000\u00a0 3 \u00a01.03\u00a0 5 \u00a0$9,270.   \n Let us trace the possible values of these three portfolios when the options expire in \n6\u00a0months as a function of the stock price at that time: \nPayoff = Value of Put at Expiration\nPro\ufb01t$100\n$1000Price of Put\nST\n Figure 20.4 Payoff and profit to put option at expiration  Consider these four option strategies: (i) buy a call; (ii) write a call; (iii) buy a put; (iv) write a put.\n a.

Portfolio  B  is worthless unless shares \nsell for more than the exercise price of the call. Once that point is reached, the portfolio is \nworth 1,000 times the excess of the stock price over the exercise price. Finally, portfolio  C\nis worth $9,270 from the investment in T-bills plus any profits from the 100 call options. \nRemember that each of these portfolios involves the same $10,000 initial investment. The \nrates of return on these three portfolios are as follows: \nStock Price\nPortfolio $95 $100 $105 $110 $115 $120\nPortfolio A: All stock 25.0% 0.0% 5.0% 10.0% 15.0% 20.0%\nPortfolio B: All options 2100.0 2100.0 250.0 0.0 50.0 100.0\nPortfolio C: Call plus bills 27.3 27.3 22.3 2.7 7.7 12.7\n These rates of return are graphed in  Figure\u00a020.5 .  \n Comparing the returns of portfolios  B  and  C  to those of the simple investment in \nstock represented by portfolio  A,  we see that options offer two interesting features. \nFirst, an option offers leverage. Compare the returns of portfolios  B  and  A.  Unless \nthe stock increases from its initial value of $100, the value of portfolio  B  falls pre-\ncipitously to zero\u2014a rate of return of negative 100%. Conversely, modest increases \nin the rate of return on the stock result in disproportionate increases in the option rate \nof return. For example, a 4.3% increase in the stock price from $115 to $120 would \nincrease the rate of return on the call from 50% to 100%. In this sense, calls are a \nlevered investment on the stock. Their values respond more than proportionately to \nchanges in the stock value. \n  Figure\u00a0 20.5  vividly illustrates this \npoint. The slope of the all-option portfo-\nlio is far steeper than that of the all-stock \nportfolio, reflecting its greater propor-\ntional sensitivity to the value of the \nunderlying security. The leverage factor \nis the reason investors (illegally) exploit-\ning inside information commonly choose \noptions as their investment vehicle. \n The potential insurance value of \noptions is the second interesting feature, \nas portfolio  C  shows. The T-bill- plus-\noption portfolio cannot be worth less \nthan $9,270 after 6 months, as the option \ncan always be left to expire worthless. \nThe worst possible rate of return on port-\nfolio  C  is  2 7.3%, compared to a (theo-\nretically) worst possible rate of return on \nthe stock of  2 100% if the company were \nto go bankrupt. Of course, this insurance \ncomes at a price: When the share price \nincreases, portfolio  C,  the option-plus-\nbills portfolio, does not perform as well \nas portfolio  A,  the all-stock portfolio. \nRate of Return (%)100\nST\n\u2212120\u2212100\u221280\u221260\u221240\u221220020406080\n86\n88\n90\n92\n94\n96\n98\n100\n102\n104\n106\n108\n110\n112\n114\n116\n118\n120\nA: All Stocks\nC: Call Plus BillsB: All Options84\n Figure 20.5 Rate of return to three strategies  \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   688bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   688 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 689\n This simple example makes an important point. Although options can be used by \nspeculators as effectively leveraged stock positions, as in portfolio  B,  they also can be \nused by investors who desire to tailor their risk exposures in creative ways, as in port-\nfolio  C.  For example, the call-plus-bills strategy of portfolio  C  provides a rate of return \nprofile quite unlike that of the stock alone. The absolute limitation on downside risk is a novel and attractive feature of this strategy. We next discuss several option strate-gies that provide other novel risk profiles that might be attractive to hedgers and other investors.    \n  An unlimited variety of payoff patterns can be achieved by combining puts and calls with \nvarious exercise prices. We explain in this section the motivation and structure of some of the more popular ones.  \n   Protective Put \n Imagine you would like to invest in a stock, but you are unwilling to bear potential losses beyond some given level. Investing in the stock alone seems risky to you because in prin-ciple you could lose all the money you invest. You might consider instead investing in stock and purchasing a put option on the stock.  Table\u00a020.1  shows the total value of your portfolio at option expiration: Whatever happens to the stock price, you are guaranteed a payoff at least equal to the put option\u2019s exercise price because the put gives you the right to sell your shares for that price.      20.3 Option Strategies \n  Figure\u00a020.6  illustrates the payoff and profit to this    protective put    strategy. The \nsolid line in  Figure\u00a020.6, panel C  is the total payoff. The dashed line is displaced downward by the cost of establishing the position,  S  \n0 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 P.  Notice that potential losses \nare limited.  \n It is instructive to compare the profit on the protective put strategy with that of the \nstock investment. For simplicity, consider an at-the-money protective put, so that  X \u00a0 5 \u00a0 S  0 .  Suppose the strike price is  X \u00a0 5 \u00a0$100 and the stock is selling at $97 at option expiration. \nThen the value of your total portfolio is $100. The stock is worth $97 and the value of \nthe expiring put option is   \nX 2 S T 5 $100 2 $97 5 $3  \n Another way to look at it is that you are holding the stock and a put contract giving you \nthe right to sell the stock for $100. The right to sell locks in a minimum portfolio value of $100. On the other hand, if the stock price is above $100, say, $104, then the right to sell a share at $100 is worthless. You allow the put to expire unexercised, ending up with a share of stock worth  S  \n T  \u00a0 5 \u00a0$104.

The profit on the stock is zero \nif the stock price remains unchanged and \nST  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 S  0 . It rises or falls by $1 for every dollar \nswing in the ultimate stock price. The profit \non the protective put is negative and equal \nto the cost of the put if  S   T   is below  S  0 . The \nprofit on the protective put increases one for \none with increases in the stock price once  S   T   \nexceeds  S  0 .  \n  Figure\u00a020.7  makes it clear that the pro-\ntective put offers some insurance against \nstock price declines in that it limits losses. \nTherefore, protective put strategies provide \na form of  portfolio insurance.   The cost of \nthe protection is that, in the case of stock \nprice increases, your profit is reduced by \nthe cost of the put, which turned out to be \nunneeded. \n This example also shows that despite \nthe common perception that derivatives \nmean risk, derivative securities can be used \neffectively for  risk management.   In fact, \nsuch risk management is becoming accepted as part of the fiduciary responsibility of \nfinancial managers. Indeed, in one often-cited court case,  Brane   v.  Roth,   a company\u2019s \nboard of directors was successfully sued for failing to use derivatives to hedge the \nprice risk of grain held in storage. Such hedging might have been accomplished using \nprotective puts. \n The claim that derivatives are best viewed as risk management tools may seem surpris-\ning in light of the credit crisis of the last few years. The crisis was immediately precipi-\ntated when the highly risky positions that many financial institutions had established in \ncredit derivatives blew up 2007\u20132008, resulting in large losses and government bailouts. \nStill, the same characteristics that make derivatives potent tools to increase risk also make \nthem highly effective in managing risk, at least when used properly. Derivatives have aptly \nbeen compared to power tools: very useful in skilled hands, but also very dangerous when \nnot handled with care. The nearby box makes the case for derivatives as central to risk \nmanagement.  \n Covered Calls \n A    covered call    position is the purchase of a share of stock with a simultaneous sale \nof a call option on that stock. The call is \u201ccovered\u201d because the potential obligation \nto deliver the stock can be satisfied using the stock held in the portfolio. Writing an \noption without an offsetting stock position is called by contrast  naked option writ-\ning.  The value of a covered call position at expiration, presented in  Table\u00a020.2 , equals \nthe stock value minus the value of the call. The call value is  subtracted   because the \ncovered call position involves writing a call to another investor who may exercise it at \nyour expense.  \nPro\ufb01ts\nPro\ufb01t on Stock\nSTPro\ufb01t on\nProtective Put\nPortfolio\n\u2212P\n\u2212S0S0 =X\n Figure 20.7 Protective put versus stock investment \n(at-the-money option)  \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   691bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   691 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n  The Case for Derivatives \n They\u2019ve been dubbed financial weapons of mass destruc-\ntion, attacked for causing the financial turmoil sweeping the nation and identified as the kryptonite that brought down the global economy. Yet few Main Streeters really know what derivatives are\u2014namely, financial contracts between a buyer and a seller that derive value from an underlying asset, such as a mortgage or a stock. There seems to be near consensus that derivatives were a source of undue risk. \n And then there\u2019s Robert Shiller. The Yale economist \nbelieves just the opposite is true. A champion of financial \ninnovation and an expert in management of risk, Shiller contends that derivatives, far from being a problem, are actually the solution. Derivatives, Shiller says, are merely a risk-management tool the same way insurance is. \u201cYou pay a premium and if an event happens, you get a pay-ment.\u201d That tool can be used well or, as happened recently, used badly. Shiller warns that banishing the tool gets us nowhere. \n For all the trillions in derivative trading, there were very \nfew traders. Almost all the subprime mortgages that were \nbundled and turned into derivatives were sold by a hand-ful of Wall Street institutions, working with a small num-ber of large institutional buyers. It was a huge but illiquid and opaque market. \n Meanwhile, the system was built on the myriad deci-\nsions of individual homeowners and lenders around the \nworld. None of them, however, could hedge their bets the way large institutions can. Those buying a condo in Miami had no way to protect themselves if the market went down. \n Derivatives, according to Shiller, could be used by home-\nowners\u2014and, by extension, lenders\u2014to insure themselves \nagainst falling prices. In Shiller\u2019s scenario, you would be able to go to your broker and buy a new type of financial instrument, perhaps a derivative that is inversely related to a regional home-price index. If the value of houses in your area declined, the financial instrument would increase in value, offsetting the loss. Lenders could do the same thing, which would help them hedge against foreclosures. The idea is to make the housing market more liquid. More buyers and sellers mean that markets stay liquid and func-tional even under pressure. \n Some critics dismiss Shiller\u2019s basic premise that more \nderivatives would make the housing market more liquid \nand more stable. They point out that futures contracts haven\u2019t made equity markets or commodity markets immune from massive moves up and down. They add that a ballooning world of home-based derivatives wouldn\u2019t lead to homeowners\u2019 insurance: it would lead to a new playground for speculators. \n In essence, Shiller is laying the intellectual ground-\nwork for the next financial revolution. We are now suffer-\ning through the first major crisis of the Information Age economy. Shiller\u2019s answers may be counterintuitive, but no more so than those of doctors and scientists who centu-ries ago recognized that the cure for infectious diseases was not flight or quarantine, but purposely infecting more people through vaccinations. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a major glitch in derivatives and securitization,\u201d says Shiller. \u201cThe Titanic sank almost a century ago, but we didn\u2019t stop sailing across the Atlantic.\u201d \n Of course, people did think twice about getting on a \nship, at least for a while. But if we listen only to our fears, \nwe lose the very dynamism that has propelled us this far. That is the nub of Shiller\u2019s call for more derivatives and more innovation. Shiller\u2019s appeal is a tough sell at a time when derivatives have produced so much havoc. But he reminds us that the tools that got us here are not to blame; they can be used badly and they can be used well. And trying to stem the ineffable tide of human creativity is a fool\u2019s errand.  \n  Source:  Zachary Karabell, \u201cThe Case for Derivatives,\u201d  Newsweek,  \nFebruary 2, 2009.  WORDS FROM THE STREET \n692 The solid line in  Figure\u00a020.8, panel C  is the payoff. You see that the total position is \nworth  S   T   when the stock price at time  T  is below  X  and rises to a maximum of  X \u00a0when  S   T   \nexceeds  X.  In essence, the sale of the call options means the call writer has sold the claim \nto any stock value above  X  in return for the initial premium (the call price). Therefore, at \nexpiration, the position is worth at most  X.  The dashed line of  Figure\u00a020.8, panel C  is the \nnet profit to the covered call.  \n Writing covered call options has been a popular investment strategy among institutional \ninvestors. Consider the managers of a fund invested largely in stocks. They might find it \nappealing to write calls on some or all of the stock in order to boost income by the premi-ums collected. Although they thereby forfeit potential capital gains should the stock price rise above the exercise price, if they view  X  as the price at which they plan to sell the stock \nanyway, then the call may be viewed as a kind of \u201csell discipline.\u201d The written call guaran-tees the stock sale will occur as planned. \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   692bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   692 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 693\nTable 20.2\nValue of a covered \ncall position at \noption expirationST\u00a0\"\u00a0XS T\u00a0+\u00a0X\n Payoff of stock ST ST\n1 Payoff of written call 20 2(ST\u00a02\u00a0X )\n5 TOTAL ST X\nSTPayoff of Stock\nPayoff of\nWritten Call\nPayoff of\nCovered Call\nPayoff\nPro\ufb01tXA: Stock\n+ B: Write Call\n= C: Covered CallSTST\nXXX\n\u2212 (S0 \u2212 C)\n Figure 20.8 Value of a covered call position at expiration  \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   693bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   693 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n694  Straddle \n A long    straddle    is established by buying both a call and a put on a stock, each with the \nsame exercise price,  X,  and the same expiration date,  T.  Straddles are useful strategies for \ninvestors who believe a stock will move a lot in price but are uncertain about the direc-\ntion of the move. For example, suppose you believe an important court case that will make or break a company is about to be settled, and the market is not yet aware of the situation. The stock will either double in value if the case is settled favorably or will drop by half if the settlement goes against the company. The straddle position will do well regardless of the outcome because its value rises when the stock price makes extreme upward or downward moves from  X.  \n The worst-case scenario for a straddle is no movement in the stock price. If  S  \n T   equals \n X,  both the call and the put expire worthless, and the investor\u2019s outlay for the purchase of \nboth options is lost. Straddle positions, therefore, are bets on volatility. An investor who Assume a pension fund holds 1,000 shares of stock, with a current price of $100 per \nshare. Suppose the portfolio manager intends to sell all 1,000 shares if the share price hits $110, and a call expiring in 60 days with an exercise price of $110 currently sells for $5. By writing 10 call contracts (for 100 shares each) the fund can pick up $5,000 in extra income. The fund would lose its share of profits from any movement of the stock price above $110 per share, but given that it would have sold its shares at $110, it would not have realized those profits anyway.Example 20.4 Covered CalleXcel APPLICATIONS: Spreads and Straddles\nUsing spreadsheets to analyze combinations of options is \nvery helpful.

Con-\nversely, investors who  write  straddles\u2014selling both a call and a put\u2014must believe the \nstock is less volatile. They accept the option premiums now, hoping the stock price will not change much before option expiration. \n The payoff to a straddle is presented in  Table\u00a020.3 . The solid line of  Figure\u00a020.9, \npanel C  illustrates this payoff. Notice the portfolio payoff is always positive, except at the one point where the portfolio has zero value,  S  \n T  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 X.  You might wonder why \nall investors don\u2019t pursue such a seemingly \u201cno-lose\u201d strategy. The reason is that the \nstraddle requires that both the put and call be purchased. The value of the portfolio at expiration, while never negative, still must exceed the initial cash outlay for a straddle investor to clear a profit.   \n The dashed line of  Figure\u00a020.9, panel C  is the profit diagram. The profit line lies below \nthe payoff line by the cost of purchasing the straddle,  P \u00a0 1 \u00a0 C.  It is clear from the dia-\ngram that the straddle generates a loss unless the stock price deviates substantially from  X.  \nThe stock price must depart from  X  by the total amount \nexpended to purchase the call and the put for the straddle to clear a profit.  \n  Strips  and  straps  are variations of straddles. A strip is \ntwo puts and one call on a security with the same exercise price and expiration date. A strap is two calls and one put.  \n  Spreads \n A    spread    is a combination of two or more call options (or two or more puts) on the same stock with differing exercise prices or times to maturity. Some options are bought, whereas others are sold, or written. A  money spread  involves the purchase of one option and the \nsimultaneous sale of another with a different exercise price. A  time spread  refers to the sale \nand purchase of options with differing expiration dates. \n Consider a money spread in which one call option is bought at an exercise price  X  \n1 , \nwhereas another call with identical expiration date, but higher exercise price,  X  2 , is writ-\nten. The payoff will be the difference in the value of the call held and the value of the call written, as in  Table\u00a020.4 .  \n There are now three instead of two outcomes to distinguish: the lowest-price region \nwhere  S  \n T   is below both exercise prices, a middle region where  S   T   is between the two exer-\ncise prices, and a high-price region where  S   T   exceeds both exercise prices.  Figure\u00a020.10  \nillustrates the payoff and profit to this strategy, which is called a  bullish spread  because the \npayoff either increases or is unaffected by stock price increases. Holders of bullish spreads \nbenefit from stock price increases.  \n One motivation for a bullish spread might be that the investor thinks one option is over-\npriced relative to another. For example, an investor who believes an  X \u00a0 5 \u00a0$100 call is cheap \ncompared to an  X \u00a0 5 \u00a0$110 call might establish the spread, even without a strong desire to \ntake a bullish position in the stock.  \n  Collars \n A    collar    is an options strategy that brackets the value of a portfolio between two bounds. Sup-pose that an investor currently is holding a large position in FinCorp stock, which is currently selling at $100 per share. A lower bound of $90 can be placed on the value of the portfolio by buying a protective put with exercise price $90. This protection, however, requires that the investor pay the put premium. To raise the money to pay for the put, the investor might write a call option, say, with exercise price $110. The call might sell for roughly the same price as the  Graph the profit and payoff diagrams for strips \nand straps.

Writing \nthe call limits the portfolio\u2019s upside potential. Even if the stock price moves above $110, the investor will do no better than $110, because at a higher price the stock will be called away. Thus the investor obtains the downside protection represented by the exercise price of the put by selling her claim to any upside potential beyond the exercise price of the call.      \n A collar would be appropriate for an investor who has a target wealth goal in mind but \nis unwilling to risk losses beyond a certain level. If you are contemplating buying a house for $220,000, for example, you might set this figure as your goal. Your current wealth may be $200,000, and you are unwilling to risk losing more than $20,000. A collar established by (1) purchasing 2,000 shares of stock currently selling at $100 per share, (2) purchasing 2,000 put options (20 options contracts) with exercise price $90, and (3) writing 2,000 calls with exercise price $110 would give you a good chance to realize the $20,000 capital gain without risking a loss of more than $20,000.  Example 20.5 Collars \n Graph the payoff diagram for the collar described in Example 20.5.  CONCEPT CHECK 20.5 \n  We saw in the previous section that a protective put portfolio, comprising a stock position \nand a put option on that position, provides a payoff with a guaranteed minimum value, but with unlimited upside potential. This is not the only way to achieve such protection, however. A call-plus-bills portfolio also can provide limited downside risk with unlimited upside potential. \n Consider the strategy of buying a call option and, in addition, buying Treasury bills with \nface value equal to the exercise price of the call, and with maturity date equal to the expira-tion date of the option. For example, if the exercise price of the call option is $100, then each option contract (which is written on 100 shares) would require payment of $10,000 upon exercise. Therefore, you would purchase a T-bill with a maturity value of $10,000. More generally, for each option that you hold with exercise price  X,  you would purchase a \nrisk-free zero-coupon bond with face value  X.  \n Examine the value of this position at time  T,  when the options expire and the zero-\ncoupon bond matures:    20.4 The Put-Call Parity Relationship \nST\u00a0\"\u00a0XS T\u00a0+\u00a0X\nValue of call option 0 ST\u00a02\u00a0X\nValue of zero-coupon bond X X\n  TOTAL X S T\n If the stock price is below the exercise price, the call is worthless, but the bond matures to its face value,  X.

The payoff to this portfolio is precisely identical to the payoff \nof the protective put that we derived in  Table\u00a020.1 . \n If two portfolios always provide equal values, then they must cost the same amount to \nestablish. Therefore, the call-plus-bond portfolio must cost the same as the stock-plus-put \nportfolio. Each call costs  C.  The riskless zero-coupon bond costs  X /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f     )  T  . Therefore, \nthe call-plus-bond portfolio costs  C \u00a0 1 \u00a0 X /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f     )  T  . The stock costs  S  0  to purchase now (at \ntime zero), while the put costs  P.  Therefore, we conclude that \n   C1X\n(11rf)T5S01P  (20.1)   \n Equation 20.1 is called the    put-call parity theorem    because it represents the proper \nrelationship between put and call prices. If the parity relation is ever violated, an arbi-\ntrage opportunity arises. For example, suppose you collect these data for a certain stock: \nStock price $110\nCall price (1-year expiration, X\u00a05\u00a0$105) $ 17\nPut price (1-year expiration, X\u00a05\u00a0$105) $   5\nRisk-free interest rate 5% per year\n We can use these data in Equation 20.1 to see if parity is violated:   \n  C1X\n(11rf)T 5?S01P\n171105\n1.05 5?11015\n 1172115  \n This result, a violation of parity\u2014117 does not equal 115\u2014indicates mispricing. To exploit the mispricing, you buy the relatively cheap portfolio (the stock-plus-put position repre-sented on the right-hand side of the equation) and sell the relatively expensive portfolio (the call-plus-bond position corresponding to the left-hand side). Therefore, if you  buy  the \nstock,  buy  the put,  write  the call, and  borrow  $100 for 1 year (because borrowing money is \nthe opposite of buying a bond), you should earn arbitrage profits. \n Let\u2019s examine the payoff to this strategy. In 1 year, the stock will be worth  S  \n T  . The $100 \nborrowed will be paid back with interest, resulting in a cash outflow of $105. The written \ncall will result in a cash outflow of  S   T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0$105 if  S   T   exceeds $105. The purchased put pays \noff $105\u00a0 2 \u00a0 S   T   if the stock price is below $105. \n  Table\u00a020.5  summarizes the outcome. The immediate cash inflow is $2. In 1 year, the \nvarious positions provide exactly offsetting cash flows: The $2 inflow is realized with-\nout any offsetting outflows. This is an arbitrage opportunity that investors will pursue on a large scale until buying and selling pressure restores the parity condition expressed in Equation 20.1.  \n Equation 20.1 actually applies only to options on stocks that pay no dividends before \nthe expiration date of the option. The extension of the parity condition for European call options on dividend-paying stocks is, however, straightforward. Problem 12 at the end of \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   699bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   699 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 0 0 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nthe chapter leads you through the demonstration. The more general formulation of the \n put-call parity  condition is \n   P5C2S01PV(X)1PV(dividends )  (20.2)   \n where PV(dividends) is the present value of the dividends that will be paid by the stock \nduring the life of the option. If the stock does not pay dividends, Equation 20.2 becomes \nidentical to Equation 20.1. \n Notice that this generalization would apply as well to European options on assets other \nthan stocks. Instead of using dividend income in Equation 20.2, we would let any income \npaid out by the underlying asset play the role of the stock dividends. For example, European \nput and call options on bonds would satisfy the same parity relationship, except that the \nbond\u2019s coupon income would replace the stock\u2019s dividend payments in the parity formula. \n Even this generalization, however, applies only to European options, as the cash flow \nstreams from the two portfolios represented by the two sides of Equation 20.2 will match \nonly if each position is held until expiration. If a call and a put may be optimally exercised \nat different times before their common expiration date, then the equality of payoffs cannot \nbe assured, or even expected, and the portfolios will have different values.

The \nFebruary expiration call with exercise price $195 and time to expiration of 28 days cost \n$3.65 while the corresponding put option cost $5. IBM was selling for $194.47, and the \nannualized short-term interest rate on this date was 0.1%. IBM was expected to pay a \ndividend of $.85 with an ex-dividend date of February 8, 18 days hence.

Is this a big enough difference to exploit? \nAlmost certainly not. You have to weigh the potential profit against the trading costs of \nthe call, put, and stock. More important, given the fact that options trade relatively infre-\nquently, this deviation from parity might not be \u201creal,\u201d but may instead be attributable \nto \u201cstale\u201d (i.e., out-of-date) price quotes at which you cannot actually trade.

Why do you need to appreciate the properties \nof options in formulating an investment plan? Many financial instruments and agreements have features that convey implicit or explicit options to one or more parties. To value and use these securities correctly, you must understand their embedded option attributes.  \n   Callable Bonds \n You know from Chapter 14 that many corporate bonds are issued with call provisions enti-tling the issuer to buy bonds back from bondholders at some time in the future at a specified call price. The bond issuer holds a call option with exercise price equal to the price at which the bond can be repurchased. A callable bond arrangement therefore is essentially a sale of a  straight bond  (a bond with no option features such as callability or convertibility) to the inves-\ntor and the concurrent issuance of a call option by the investor to the bond-issuing firm. \n There must be some compensation for the firm\u2019s implicit call option. If the callable \nbond were issued with the same coupon rate as a straight bond, it would sell at a lower price than the straight bond: the price difference would equal the value of the call. To sell callable bonds at par, firms must issue them with coupon rates higher than the coupons on straight debt. The higher coupons are the investor\u2019s compensation for the call option retained by the issuer. \n  Figure\u00a020.11  illustrates this optionlike property. The horizontal axis is the value of a \nstraight bond with otherwise identical terms to the callable bond. The dashed 45-degree line represents the value of straight debt. The solid line is the value of the callable bond, and the dotted line is the value of the call option retained by the firm. A callable bond\u2019s potential for capital gains is limited by the firm\u2019s option to repurchase at the call price.  \n How is a callable bond similar to a covered call strategy on a straight bond?  CONCEPT CHECK 20.6 \n The option inherent in callable bonds actually is more complex than an ordinary call \noption, because usually it may be exercised only after some initial period of call protec-tion. The price at which the bond is callable may change over time also. Unlike exchange-listed options, these features are defined in the initial bond covenant and will depend on the needs of the issuing firm and its perception of the market\u2019s tastes.   \n Suppose the period of call protection is extended. How will the coupon rate the \ncompany needs to offer on its bonds change to enable the issuer to sell the bonds at par value?  CONCEPT CHECK 20.7 \n  Convertible Securities \n Convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock convey options to the holder of the \nsecurity rather than to the issuing firm. A convertible security typically gives its holder the \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   701bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   701 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 0 2 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nright to exchange each bond or share \nof preferred stock for a fixed number \nof shares of common stock, regard-\nless of the market prices of the secu-\nrities at the time. \n For example, a bond with a  con-\nversion ratio   of 10 allows its holder to \nconvert one bond of par value $1,000 \ninto 10 shares of common stock. \nAlternatively, we say the  conversion \nprice   in this case is $100: To receive \n10 shares of stock, the investor sacri-\nfices bonds with face value $1,000 or, \nput another way, $100 of face value \nper share. If the present value of the \nbond\u2019s scheduled payments is less \nthan 10 times the value of one share \nof stock, it may pay to convert; that is, \nthe conversion option is in the money. \nA bond worth $950 with a conversion \nratio of 10 could be converted profit-\nably if the stock were selling above \n$95, as the value of the 10 shares \nreceived for each bond surrendered would exceed $950. Most convertible bonds are issued \n\u201cdeep out of the money.\u201d That is, the issuer sets the conversion ratio so that conversion will \nnot be profitable unless there is a substantial increase in stock prices and/or decrease in bond \nprices from the time of issue.  \n A bond\u2019s  conversion value   equals the value it would have if you converted it into stock \nimmediately. Clearly, a bond must sell for at least its conversion value. If it did not, you could \npurchase the bond, convert it, and clear an immediate profit. This condition could never persist, \nfor all investors would pursue such a strategy and ultimately would bid up the price of the bond. \n The straight bond value, or \u201cbond floor,\u201d is the value the bond would have if it were not \nconvertible into stock. The bond must sell for more than its straight bond value because \na convertible bond has more value; it is in fact a straight bond plus a valuable call option. \nTherefore, the convertible bond has two lower bounds on its market price: the conversion \nvalue and the straight bond value.  \nValue of Straight Debt\nValue of Callable Bond\nCall PriceValue of Firm\u2019s\nCall Option\nValue of\nStraight Debt\n Figure 20.11 Values of callable bonds compared with straight bonds  \n Should a convertible bond issued at par value have a higher or lower coupon rate \nthan a nonconvertible bond issued at par?  CONCEPT CHECK 20.8 \n  Figure\u00a020.12  illustrates the optionlike properties of the convertible bond.  Figure\u00a020.12, \npanel A  shows the value of the straight debt as a function of the stock price of the issu-\ning firm. For healthy firms, the straight debt value is almost independent of the value of \nthe stock because default risk is small. However, if the firm is close to bankruptcy (stock \nprices are low), default risk increases, and the straight bond value falls. Panel B shows the \nconversion value of the bond. Panel C compares the value of the convertible bond to these \ntwo lower bounds.  \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   702bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   702 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 703\n When stock prices are low, the straight bond value is the effective lower bound, and the \nconversion option is nearly irrelevant. The convertible will trade like straight debt. When \nstock prices are high, the bond\u2019s price is determined by its conversion value. With conver-\nsion all but guaranteed, the bond is essentially equity in disguise. \n We can illustrate with two examples: \nStraight Debt Value\nStock PriceA\nConversion Value\nStock PriceB\nConvertible Bond Value\nStraight DebtConversion ValueConvertible Bond Value\nStock PriceC\n Figure 20.12 Value of a convertible bond as a function of stock price.

Its value as straight debt, in contrast, is \n$967. This is the present value of the coupon and principal payments at a market rate for \nstraight debt of 8.5%. The bond\u2019s price is $972, so the premium over straight bond value is only $5, reflecting the low probability of conversion. Its reported yield to maturity based on scheduled coupon payments and the market price of $972 is 8.42%, close to that of straight debt. \n The conversion option on bond  B  is in the money. Conversion value is $1,250, and the \nbond\u2019s price, $1,255, reflects its value as equity (plus $5 for the protection the bond offers against stock price declines). The bond\u2019s reported yield is 4.76%, far below the compa-rable yield on straight debt. The big yield sacrifice is attributable to the far greater value of the conversion option. \n In theory, we could value convertible bonds by treating them as straight debt plus call \noptions. In practice, however, this approach is often impractical for several reasons:\n    1. The conversion price frequently increases over time, which means the exercise \nprice of the option changes.  \n   2. Stocks may pay several dividends over the life of the bond, further complicating the \noption-valuation analysis.  \n   3. Most convertibles also are callable at the discretion of the firm. In essence, both \nthe investor and the issuer hold options on each other. If the issuer exercises its call option to repurchase the bond, the bondholders typically have a month during which they still can convert. When issuers use a call option, knowing bondholders will choose to convert, the issuer is said to have  forced a conversion.  These condi-\ntions together mean the actual maturity of the bond is indeterminate.     \n  Warrants \n    Warrants    are essentially call options issued by a firm. One important difference between calls and warrants is that exercise of a warrant requires the firm to issue a new share of stock\u2014the total number of shares outstanding increases. Exercise of a call option requires only that the writer of the call deliver an already-issued share of stock to discharge the obligation. In that case, the number of shares outstanding remains fixed. Also unlike call options, warrants result in a cash flow to the firm when the warrant holder pays the exer-cise price. These differences mean that warrant values will differ somewhat from the val-ues of call options with identical terms. \n Like convertible debt, warrant terms may be tailored to meet the needs of the firm. Also \nlike convertible debt, warrants generally are protected against stock splits and dividends in that the exercise price and the number of warrants held are adjusted to offset the effects of the split. \n Warrants are often issued in conjunction with another security. Bonds, for example, \nmay be packaged together with a warrant \u201csweetener,\u201d frequently a warrant that may be sold separately. This is called a  detachable warrant.  \n Issue of warrants and convertible securities creates the potential for an increase in out-\nstanding shares of stock if exercise occurs. Exercise obviously would affect financial sta-tistics that are computed on a per-share basis, so annual reports must provide earnings per share figures under the assumption that all convertible securities and warrants are exer-cised. These figures are called  fully diluted earnings per share.   \n3    \n  3 We should note that the exercise of a convertible bond need not reduce EPS. Diluted EPS will be less than undi-\nluted EPS only if interest saved (per share) on the convertible bonds is less than the prior EPS. \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   704bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   704 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 705\n The executive and employee stock options that became so popular in the 1990s \nactually were warrants. Some of these grants were huge, with payoffs to top executives in \nexcess of $100 million. Yet firms almost uniformly chose not to acknowledge these grants as expenses on their income statements until new reporting rules that took effect in 2006 required such recognition.  \n  Collateralized Loans \n Many loan arrangements require that the borrower put up collateral to guarantee the loan will be paid back. In the event of default, the lender takes possession of the collateral. A  nonrecourse loan  gives the lender no recourse beyond the right to the collateral. That is, \nthe lender may not sue the borrower for further payment if the collateral turns out not to be valuable enough to repay the loan. \n This arrangement gives an implicit call option to the borrower. Assume the borrower is \nobligated to pay back  L  dollars at the maturity of the loan. The collateral will be worth  S  \n T   \ndollars at maturity. (Its value today is  S  0 .) The borrower has the option to wait until loan \nmaturity and repay the loan only if the collateral is worth more than the  L  dollars necessary \nto satisfy the loan. If the collateral is worth less than  L,  the borrower can default on the \nloan, discharging the obligation by forfeiting the collateral, which is worth only  S   T  .  4    \n Another way of describing such a loan is to view the borrower as turning over the col-\nlateral to the lender but retaining the right to reclaim it by paying off the loan. The transfer \nof the collateral with the right to reclaim it is equivalent to a payment of  S  0  dollars, less a \nsimultaneous recovery of a sum that resembles a call option with exercise price  L.  In effect, \nthe borrower turns over collateral but keeps an option to \u201crepurchase\u201d it for  L  dollars at the \nmaturity of the loan if  L  turns out to be less than  S   T  . This is a call option. \n A third way to look at a collateralized loan is to assume that the borrower will repay the \n L  dollars with certainty but also retain the option to sell the collateral to the lender for  L  \ndollars, even if  S   T   is less than  L.  In this case, the sale of the collateral would generate the \ncash necessary to satisfy the loan. The ability to \u201csell\u201d the collateral for a price of  L  dollars \nrepresents a put option, which guarantees the borrower can raise enough money to satisfy \nthe loan simply by turning over the collateral. \n It is perhaps surprising to realize that we can describe the same loan as involving either \na put option or a call option, as the payoffs to calls and puts are so different. Yet the equiva-lence of the two approaches is nothing more than a reflection of the put-call parity rela-tionship. In our call-option description of the loan, the value of the borrower\u2019s liability is  S  \n0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 C:  The borrower turns over the asset, which is a transfer of  S  0  dollars, but retains \na call worth  C  dollars. In the put-option description, the borrower is obligated to pay  L  \ndollars but retains the put, which is worth  P:  The present value of this net obligation is \n L /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f     )   T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P.   Because these alternative descriptions are equivalent ways of viewing the \nsame loan, the value of the obligations must be equal:   \n S02C5L\n(11rf)T2P  (20.3)   \n Treating  L  as the exercise price of the option, Equation 20.3 is simply the put-call parity \nrelationship. \n  4 In reality, of course, defaulting on a loan is not so simple. There are losses of reputation involved as well as \nconsiderations of ethical behavior. This is a description of a pure nonrecourse loan where both parties agree from \nthe outset that only the collateral backs the loan and that default is not to be taken as a sign of bad faith if the col-lateral is insufficient to repay the loan. \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   705bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   705 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 0 6 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n  Figure\u00a020.13  illustrates this fact.

In effect, any time the \ncorporation borrows money, the maximum possible collateral for the loan is the total of \nthe firm\u2019s assets. If the firm declares bankruptcy, we can interpret this as an admission that \nthe assets of the firm are insufficient to satisfy the claims against it. The corporation may \ndischarge its obligations by transferring ownership of the firm\u2019s assets to the creditors. \n Just as is true for nonrecourse collateralized loans, the required payment to the credi-\ntors represents the exercise price of the implicit option, while the value of the firm is the \nunderlying asset. The equityholders have a put option to transfer their ownership claims on \nthe firm to the creditors in return for the face value of the firm\u2019s debt. \n Alternatively, we may view the equityholders as retaining a call option. They have, \nin effect, already transferred their ownership claim to the firm to the creditors but have \nretained the right to reacquire that claim by paying off the loan. Hence the equityholders \nhave the option to \u201cbuy back\u201d the firm for a specified price: They have a call option. \n The significance of this observation is that analysts can value corporate bonds using \noption-pricing techniques. The default premium required of risky debt in principle can be \nestimated by using option-valuation models. We consider some of these models in the next \nchapter.    \n  One of the attractions of options is the ability they provide to create investment positions \nwith payoffs that depend in a variety of ways on the values of other securities. We have \nseen evidence of this capability in the various options strategies examined in Section 20.4. \n Options also can be used to \ncustom-design new securities \nor portfolios with desired pat-\nterns of exposure to the price \nof an underlying security. In \nthis sense, options (and futures \ncontracts, to be discussed in \nChapters 22 and 23) provide \nthe ability to engage in  finan-\ncial engineering,   the creation \nof portfolios with specified \npayoff patterns. \n A simple example of a prod-\nuct engineered with options \nis the index-linked certifi-\ncate of deposit. Index-linked \nCDs enable retail investors to \ntake small positions in index \noptions. Unlike conventional \nCDs, which pay a fixed rate of \ninterest, these CDs pay deposi-\ntors a specified fraction of the    20.6 Financial Engineering \nRate of Return on Index-Linked CD\nSlope = .7\nrM = Market Rate\nof Return\n Figure 20.14 Return on index-linked CD  \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   707bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   707 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n708 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nrate of return on a market index such as the S&P 500, while guaranteeing a minimum rate \nof return should the market fall. For example, the index-linked CD may offer 70% of any market increase, but protect its holder from any market decrease by guaranteeing at least no loss. \n The index-linked CD is clearly a type of call option. If the market rises, the depositor \nprofits according to the  participation rate  or  multiplier,  in this case 70%; if the market \nfalls, the investor is insured against loss. Just as clearly, the bank offering these CDs is in effect writing call options and can hedge its position by buying index calls in the options market.  Figure\u00a020.14  shows the nature of the bank\u2019s obligation to its depositors.  \n How might the bank set the appropriate multiplier? To answer this, note various fea-\ntures of the option:\n    1. The price the depositor is paying for the options is the forgone interest on the \nconventional CD that could be purchased. Because interest is received at the end of\u00a0the period, the present value of the interest payment on each dollar invested is  r  \n f    /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f   ). Therefore, the depositor trades a sure payment with present value per \ndollar invested of  r   f    /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f    ) for a return that depends on the market\u2019s performance. \nConversely, the bank can fund its obligation using the interest that it would have \npaid on a conventional CD.  \n   2. The option we have described is an at-the-money option, meaning that the exercise \nprice equals the current value of the stock index. The option goes into the money as soon as the market index increases from its level at the inception of the contract.  \n   3. We can analyze the option on a per-dollar-invested basis. For example, the option \ncosts the depositor  r  \n f   /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f   ) dollars per dollar placed in the index-linked CD.\u00a0The \nmarket price of the option per dollar invested is  C / S  0 : The at-the-money option \ncosts  C  dollars and is written on one unit of the market index, currently at  S  0 .     \n Now it is easy to determine the multiplier that the bank can offer on the CDs. It receives \nfrom its depositors a \u201cpayment\u201d of  r   f     /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f   ) per dollar invested. It costs the bank  C / S  0  to \npurchase the call option on a $1 investment in the market index. Therefore, if  r   f     /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f   ) is, \nfor example, 70% of  C / S  0 , the bank can purchase at most .7 call option on the $1 investment \nand the multiplier will be .7. More generally, the break-even multiplier on an index-linked \nCD is  r   f     /(1\u00a0 1  \u00a0 r   f   ) divided by  C / S  0 .  \n Suppose that  r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 6% per year, and that 6-month maturity at-the-money calls on \nthe market index currently cost $50. The index is at 1,000. Then the option costs \n50/1,000\u00a0 5 \u00a0$.05 per dollar of market value. The CD rate is 3% per 6 months, meaning \nthat  r   f   /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  )\u00a0 5 \u00a0.03/1.03\u00a0 5 \u00a0.0291. Therefore, the multiplier would be .0291/.05\u00a0 5 \u00a0.5825.  Example 20.7 Indexed-Linked CDs \n The index-linked CD has several variants. Investors can purchase similar CDs that guar-\nantee a positive minimum return if they are willing to settle for a smaller multiplier. In this \ncase, the option is \u201cpurchased\u201d by the depositor for ( r   f  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 r  min )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f   ) dollars per dol-\nlar invested, where  r  min  is the guaranteed minimum return. Because the purchase price is \nlower, fewer options can be purchased, which results in a lower multiplier. Another variant \nof the \u201cbullish\u201d CD we have described is the  bear CD,  which pays depositors a fraction of \nany  fall  in the market index. For example, a bear CD might offer a rate of return of .6 times \nany percentage decline in the S&P 500.    \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   708bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   708 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 709\n Continue to assume that  r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a03% per half-year, that at-the-money calls sell for $50, and that the market \nindex is at 1,000. What would be the multiplier for 6-month bullish equity-linked CDs offering a guaran-\nteed minimum return of .5% over the term of the CD?  CONCEPT CHECK 20.9 \n  Options markets have been tremendously successful. Investors clearly value the portfolio \nstrategies made possible by trading options; this is reflected in the heavy trading volume in these markets. Success breeds imitation, and in recent years we have witnessed con-siderable innovation in the range of option instruments available to investors. Part of this innovation has occurred in the market for customized options, which now trade in active over-the-counter markets. Many of these options have terms that would have been highly unusual even a few years ago; they are therefore called  exotic options.  In this section we \nsurvey a few of the more interesting variants of these new instruments.  \n   Asian Options \n You already have been introduced to American- and European-style options. Asian-style options are options with payoffs that depend on the  average  price of the underlying asset \nduring at least some portion of the life of the option. For example, an Asian call option may have a payoff equal to the average stock price over the last 3 months minus the strike price if that value is positive, and zero otherwise. These options may be of interest, for example, to firms that wish to hedge a profit stream that depends on the average price of a commod-ity over some period of time.  \n  Barrier Options \n Barrier options have payoffs that depend not only on some asset price at option expiration, but also on whether the underlying asset price has crossed through some \u201cbarrier.\u201d For example, a down-and-out option is one type of barrier option that automatically expires worthless if and when the stock price falls below some barrier price. Similarly, down-and-in options will not provide a payoff unless the stock price  does  fall below some barrier at least once during \nthe life of the option. These options also are referred to as knock-out and knock-in options.  \n  Lookback Options \n Lookback options have payoffs that depend in part on the minimum or maximum price of the underlying asset during the life of the option. For example, a lookback call option might provide a payoff equal to the  maximum  stock price during the life of the option \nminus the exercise price, instead of the  final  stock price minus the exercise price. Such an \noption provides (for a price, of course) a form of perfect market timing, providing the call holder with a payoff equal to the one that would accrue if the asset were purchased for  X  \ndollars and later sold at what turns out to be its high price.  \n  Currency-Translated Options \n Currency-translated options have either asset or exercise prices denominated in a foreign currency. For example, the  quanto  allows an investor to fix in advance the exchange rate at    20.7 Exotic Options \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   709bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   709 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\n     1 .   A call option is the right to buy an asset at an agreed-upon exercise price. A put option is the right \nto sell an asset at a given exercise price.  \n    2 .   American-style options allow exercise on or before the expiration date. European options allow exercise only on the expiration date. Most traded options are American in nature.  \n    3 .   Options are traded on stocks, stock indexes, foreign currencies, fixed-income securities, and sev-eral futures contracts.  \n    4 .   Options can be used either to lever up an investor\u2019s exposure to an asset price or to provide insur-ance against volatility of asset prices. Popular option strategies include covered calls, protective puts, straddles, spreads, and collars.  \n    5 .   The put-call parity theorem relates the prices of put and call options. If the relationship is vio-lated, arbitrage opportunities will result. Specifically, the relationship that must be satisfied is   \nP5C2S\n01PV(X)1PV(dividends )  \n   where  X  is the exercise price of both the call and the put options, PV( X ) is the present value of a \nclaim to  X  dollars to be paid at the expiration date of the options, and PV(dividends) is the present \nvalue of dividends to be paid before option expiration.  \n    6 .   Many commonly traded securities embody option characteristics. Examples of these securities are callable bonds, convertible bonds, and warrants. Other arrangements such as collateralized loans and limited-liability borrowing can be analyzed as conveying implicit options to one or more parties.  \n    7 .   Trading in so-called exotic options now takes place in an active over-the-counter market.

The right to \ntranslate a fixed amount of foreign currency into dollars at a given exchange rate is a sim-ple foreign exchange option. Quantos are more interesting because the amount of currency that will be translated into dollars depends on the investment performance of the foreign security. Therefore, a quanto in effect provides a  random number  of options.  \n  Digital Options \n Digital options, also called binary or \u201cbet\u201d options, have fixed payoffs that depend on whether a condition is satisfied by the price of the underlying asset. For example, a digital call option might pay off a fixed amount of $100 if the stock price at maturity exceeds the exercise price.     \nbod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   710bod61671_ch20_678-721.indd   710 7/25/13   2:50 AM7/25/13   2:50 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 20 Options Markets: Introduction 711\n    1.

You are \nready to sell the shares but would prefer to put off the sale until next year for tax reasons. If you continue to hold the shares until January, however, you face the risk that the stock will drop in value before year-end. You decide to use a collar to limit downside risk without laying out a good deal of additional funds. January call options with a strike of $35 are selling at $2, and January puts with a strike price of $45 are selling at $3. What will be the value of your portfolio in January (net of the proceeds from the options) if the stock price ends up at: ( a ) $30, ( b ) $40, \nor ( c ) $50? Compare these proceeds to what you would realize if you simply continued to hold \nthe shares.  \n   12.

(CSI), received 10,000 shares of company \nstock as part of his compensation package. The stock currently sells at $40 a share. Joseph \nwould like to defer selling the stock until the next tax year. In January, however, he will need to sell all his holdings to provide for a down payment on his new house. Joseph is worried about the price risk involved in keeping his shares. At current prices, he would receive $400,000 for the stock. If the value of his stock holdings falls below $350,000, his ability to come up with the necessary down payment would be jeopardized. On the other hand, if the stock value rises to $450,000, he would be able to maintain a small cash reserve even after making the down pay-ment. Joseph considers three investment strategies:\n     a.  Strategy A is to write January call options on the CSI shares with strike price $45. These \ncalls are currently selling for $3 each.  \n    b.  Strategy B is to buy January put options on CSI with strike price $35. These options also sell \nfor $3 each.  \n    c.  Strategy C is to establish a zero-cost collar by writing the January calls and buying the \nJanuary puts.    \n  Evaluate each of these strategies with respect to Joseph\u2019s investment goals.

We noted that \nmany securities contain embedded options that affect both their values and their risk\u2013return characteristics. In this chapter, we turn our attention to option-valuation issues. To understand most option-valuation models requires considerable mathematical and sta-tistical background. Still, many of the ideas and insights of these models can be demon-strated in simple examples, and we will con-centrate on these. \n We start with a discussion of the factors \nthat ought to affect option prices. After \nthis discussion, we present several bounds within which option prices must lie. Next we turn to quantitative models, starting with a simple \u201ctwo-state\u201d option-valuation model, and then showing how this approach can be generalized into a useful and accurate pric-ing tool. We then move on to one particular valuation formula, the famous Black-Scholes model, one of the most significant break-throughs in finance theory in several decades. Finally, we look at some of the more impor-tant applications of option-pricing theory in portfolio management and control. \n Option-pricing models allow us to \u201cback \nout\u201d market estimates of stock-price volatil-\nity, and we will examine these measures of implied volatility. Next we turn to some of the more important applications of option-pricing theory in risk management. Finally, we take a brief look at some of the empirical evidence on option pricing, and the implications of that evidence concerning the limitations of the Black-Scholes model.   CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \n Option Valuation \n    21.1 Option Valuation: Introduction \n   Intrinsic and Time Values \n Consider a call option that is out of the money at the moment, with the stock price below \nthe exercise price. This does not mean the option is valueless. Even though immediate exercise today would be unprofitable, the call retains a positive value because there is always a chance the stock price will increase sufficiently by the expiration date to allow for profitable exercise. If not, the worst that can happen is that the option will expire with zero value. 2\n PART VI \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   722bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   722 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 21 Option Valuation 723\n The value  S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 X  is sometimes called the    intrinsic value    of in-the-money call options \nbecause it gives the payoff that could be obtained by immediate exercise. Intrinsic value is \nset equal to zero for out-of-the-money or at-the-money options. The difference between the actual call price and the intrinsic value is commonly called the    time value    of the option. \n \u201cTime value\u201d is unfortunate terminology because it may confuse the option\u2019s time value \nwith the time value of money. Time value in the options context refers simply to the dif-ference between the option\u2019s price and the value the option would have if it were expiring immediately. It is the part of the option\u2019s value that may be attributed to the fact that it still has positive time to expiration. \n Most of an option\u2019s time value typically is a type of \u201cvolatility value.\u201d Because the \noption holder can choose not to exercise, the payoff cannot be worse than zero. Even if a call option is out of the money now, it still will sell for a positive price because it offers the potential for a profit if the stock price increases, while imposing no risk of additional loss should the stock price fall. The volatility value lies in the value of the right  not  to exercise \nthe call if that action would be unprofitable. The option to exercise, as opposed to the obli-gation to exercise, provides insurance against poor stock price performance. \n As the stock price increases substantially, it becomes likely that the call option will \nbe exercised by expiration. Ultimately, with exercise all but assured, the volatility value becomes minimal. As the stock price gets ever larger, the option value approaches the \u201cadjusted\u201d intrinsic value, the stock price minus the present value of the exercise price,  S  \n0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0PV( X  ). \n Why should this be? If you are virtually certain the option will be exercised and the \nstock purchased for  X  dollars, it is as though you own the stock already. The stock cer-\ntificate, with a value today of  S  0 , might as well be sitting in your safe-deposit box now, \nas it will be there in only a few months. You just haven\u2019t paid for it yet. The present \nvalue of your obligation is the present value of  X,  so the net value of the call option is \n S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0PV( X  ).  1    \n  Figure\u00a021.1  illustrates the call option valuation function. The value curve shows that \nwhen the stock price is very low, the option is nearly worthless, because there is almost \nno chance that it will be exercised. When the stock price is very high, the option value approaches adjusted intrinsic value. In the midrange case, where the option is approxi-mately at the money, the option curve diverges from the straight lines corresponding to adjusted intrinsic value. This is because although exercise today would have a negligible (or negative) payoff, the volatility value of the option is quite high in this region. \n  The call always increases in value with the stock price. The slope is greatest, however, \nwhen the option is deep in the money. In this case, exercise is all but assured, and the option increases in price one-for-one with the stock price.  \n  Determinants of Option Values \n We can identify at least six factors that should affect the value of a call option: the stock price, the exercise price, the volatility of the stock price, the time to expiration, the inter-est rate, and the dividend rate of the stock. The call option should increase in value with the stock price and decrease in value with the exercise price because the payoff to a call, \n  1 This discussion presumes that the stock pays no dividends until after option expiration. If the stock does pay \ndividends before expiration, then there  is  a reason you would care about getting the stock now rather than at \nexpiration\u2014getting it now entitles you to the interim dividend payments. In this case, the adjusted intrinsic value \nof the option must subtract the value of the dividends the stock will pay out before the call is exercised. Adjusted intrinsic value would more generally be defined as  S  \n0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0PV( X  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0PV( D ), where  D  is the dividend to be paid \nbefore option expiration. \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   723bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   723 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 2 4 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nif exercised, equals  S   T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 X.  The magnitude of the expected payoff increases with the \ndifference  S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 X.  \n Call option values also increase with the volatility of the underlying stock price. To see \nwhy, consider circumstances where possible stock prices at expiration may range from $10 \nto $50 compared to a situation where they range only from $20 to $40. In both cases, the \nexpected, or average, stock price will be $30. Suppose the exercise price on a call option is \nalso $30. What are the option payoffs? \n  High-Volatility Scenario  \n Stock price  $10  $20  $30  $40  $50 \n Option payoff  0  0  0  10  20 \n  Low-Volatility Scenario  \n Stock price  $20  $25  $30  $35  $40 \n Option payoff  0  0  0  5  10 \n If each outcome is equally likely, with probability .2, the expected payoff to the option \nunder high-volatility conditions will be $6, but under low-volatility conditions the expected \npayoff is half as much, only $3. \n Despite the fact that the average stock price in each scenario is $30, the average option \npayoff is greater in the high-volatility scenario. The source of this extra value is the limited \nloss an option holder can suffer, or the volatility value of the call.

Obviously, extremely poor stock \nprice performance is no worse for the call option holder than moderately poor performance. \n In the case of good stock performance, however, the call will expire in the money, and \nit will be more profitable the higher the stock price. Thus extremely good stock outcomes \ncan improve the option payoff without limit, but extremely poor outcomes cannot worsen \nthe payoff below zero. This asymmetry means that volatility in the underlying stock price \nincreases the expected payoff to the option, thereby enhancing its value.  2    \n Similarly, longer time to expiration increases the value of a call option. For more distant \nexpiration dates, there is more time for unpredictable future events to affect prices, and the \nrange of likely stock prices increases. This has an effect similar to that of increased volatil-\nity. Moreover, as time to expiration lengthens, the present value of the exercise price falls, \nthereby benefiting the call option holder and increasing the option value. As a corollary \nto this issue, call option values are higher when interest rates rise (holding the stock price \nconstant) because higher interest rates also reduce the present value of the exercise price.  \n Finally, the dividend payout policy of the firm affects \noption values. A high-dividend payout policy puts a drag \non the rate of growth of the stock price. For any expected \ntotal rate of return on the stock, a higher dividend yield \nmust imply a lower expected rate of capital gain. This drag \non stock price appreciation decreases the potential pay-\noff from the call option, thereby lowering the call value. \n Table\u00a021.1  summarizes these relationships.     \n  If This Variable Increases .\u00a0.\u00a0.

CONCEPT CHECK 21.1 \n2 You should be careful interpreting the relationship between volatility and option value. Neither the focus of this \nanalysis on total (as opposed to systematic) volatility nor the conclusion that options buyers seem to like volatil-\nity contradicts modern portfolio theory. In conventional discounted cash flow analysis, we find the discount rate \nappropriate for a  given   distribution of future cash flows. Greater risk implies a higher discount rate and lower \npresent value. Here, however, the cash flow from the  option   depends on the volatility of the  stock.   The option \nvalue increases not because traders like risk but because the expected cash flow to the option holder increases \nalong with the volatility of the underlying asset.    21.2 Restrictions on Option Values  \n Several quantitative models of option pricing have been devised, and we will examine \nsome of them later in this chapter. All models, however, rely on simplifying assump-\ntions. You might wonder which properties of option values are truly general and which \ndepend on the particular simplifications. To start with, we will consider some of the more \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   725bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   725 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n726 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nimportant general properties of option prices. Some of these properties have important \nimplications for the effect of stock dividends on option values and the possible profitability of early exercise of an American option.  \n   Restrictions on the Value of a Call Option \n The most obvious restriction on the value of a call option is that its value cannot be nega-tive. Because the option need not be exercised, it cannot impose any liability on its holder; moreover, as long as there is any possibility that at some point the option can be exercised profitably, it will command a positive price. Its payoff is zero at worst, and possibly posi-tive, so it has some positive value. \n We can place another lower bound on the value of a call option. Suppose that the stock \nwill pay a dividend of  D  dollars just before the expiration date of the option, denoted by \n T  (where today is time 0). Now compare two portfolios, one consisting of a call option on \none share of stock and the other a leveraged equity position consisting of that share and borrowing of ( X \u00a0 1 \u00a0 D )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  \n f  )  T   dollars. The loan repayment is  X \u00a0 1 \u00a0 D  dollars, due on the \nexpiration date of the option. For example, for a half-year maturity option with exercise \nprice $70, dividends to be paid of $5, and effective annual interest of 10%, you would pur-chase one share of stock and borrow $75/(1.10) \n1/2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$71.51. In 6 months, when the loan \nmatures, the payment due is $75. \n At that time, the payoff to the leveraged equity position would be\n    In General    Our Numbers  \n  Stock value   S   T  \u00a0 1 \u00a0 D    S   T  \u00a0 1 \u00a05 \n    2  \u00a0Payback of loan      2  (  X  \u00a0  1  \u00a0  D  )        2  75  \n     TOTAL    S   T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 X    S   T  \u00a0 2 \u00a070 \nwhere  S   T   denotes the stock price at the option expiration date. Notice that the payoff to the \nstock is the ex-dividend stock value plus dividends received. Whether the total payoff to \nthe stock-plus-borrowing position is positive or negative depends on whether  S   T   exceeds  X.  \nThe net cash outlay required to establish this leveraged equity position is  S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0$71.51, or, \nmore generally,  S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0( X \u00a0 1 \u00a0 D )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  )  T  , that is, the current price of the stock,  S  0 , less the \ninitial cash inflow from the borrowing position. \n The payoff to the call option will be  S   T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 X  if the option expires in the money and zero \notherwise. Thus the option payoff is equal to the leveraged equity payoff when that payoff \nis positive and is greater when the leveraged equity position has a negative payoff. Because the option payoff is always greater than or equal to that of the leveraged equity position, the option price must exceed the cost of establishing that position. \n Therefore, the value of the call must be greater than  S  \n0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0( X \u00a0 1 \u00a0 D )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  )  T  , or, more \ngenerally,   \nC$S02PV(X)2PV(D) \nwhere PV( X ) denotes the present value of the exercise price and PV( D ) is the present value \nof the dividends the stock will pay at the option\u2019s expiration. More generally, we can inter-\npret PV( D ) as the present value of any and all dividends to be paid prior to the option expi-\nration date. Because we know already that the value of a call option must be nonnegative, we may conclude that  C  is greater than the  maximum  of either 0 or  S  \n0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0PV( X )\u00a0 2 \u00a0PV( D ). \n We also can place an upper bound on the possible value of the call; this bound is simply \nthe stock price. No one would pay more than  S  0  dollars for the right to purchase a stock \ncurrently worth  S  0  dollars. Thus  C \u00a0#\u00a0 S  0 . \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   726bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   726 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 21 Option Valuation 727\n  Figure\u00a0 21.2  demonstrates graphically \nthe range of prices that is ruled out by these \nupper and lower bounds for the value of a call \noption. Any option value outside the shaded \narea is not possible according to the restric-\ntions we have derived. Before expiration, the \ncall option value normally will be  within   the \nallowable range, touching neither the upper \nnor lower bound, as in  Figure\u00a021.3 . \n     Early Exercise and Dividends \n A call option holder who wants to close out \nthat position has two choices: exercise the \ncall or sell it. If the holder exercises at time  t,  \nthe call will provide a payoff of  S   t  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 X,  \nassuming, of course, that the option is in the \nmoney. We have just seen that the option can \nbe sold for at least  S   t  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 PV( X )\u00a0  2 \u00a0  PV ( D ). \nTherefore, for an option on a non-dividend-\npaying stock,  C  is greater than  S   t  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 PV ( X ). \nBecause the present value of  X  is less than  X  \nitself, it follows that \n  C$St2PV(X).St2X  \n The implication here is that the pro-\nceeds from a sale of the option (at price  C ) \nmust exceed the proceeds from an exercise \n( S   t  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 X ). It is economically more attractive \nto sell the call, which keeps it alive, than to \nexercise and thereby end the option. In other \nwords, calls on  non-dividend-paying stocks \nare \u201cworth more alive than dead.\u201d \n If it never pays to exercise a call option \nbefore expiration, the right to exercise \nearly actually must be valueless. We con-\nclude that the values of otherwise identi-\ncal American and European call options \non stocks paying no dividends are equal. \nThis simplifies matters, because any valu-\nation formula that applies to the European \ncall, for which only one exercise date \nneed be considered, also must apply to an \nAmerican call. \n As most stocks do pay dividends, you \nmay wonder whether this result is just a theo-\nretical curiosity. It is not: Reconsider our \nargument and you will see that all that we really require is that the stock pay no dividends \n until the option expires.

To \nsee why, consider a simple example. Suppose that you purchase a put option on a stock. Soon \nthe firm goes bankrupt, and the stock price falls to zero. Of course you want to exercise now, \nbecause the stock price can fall no lower. Immediate exercise gives you immediate receipt of \nthe exercise price, which can be invested to start generating income. Delay in exercise means a \ntime-value-of-money cost. The right to exercise a put option before expiration must have value. \n Now suppose instead that the firm is only  nearly   bankrupt, with the stock selling at just \na few cents. Immediate exercise may still be optimal. After all, the stock price can fall by \nonly a very small amount, meaning that the proceeds from future exercise cannot be more \nthan a few cents greater than the proceeds from immediate exercise. Against this possibil-\nity of a tiny increase in proceeds must be weighed the time-value-of-money cost of defer-\nring exercise. Clearly, there is some stock price below which early exercise is optimal. \n This argument also proves that the American put must be worth more than its European \ncounterpart. The American put allows you to exercise anytime before expiration. Because \nthe right to exercise early may be useful in some circumstances, it will command a \n premium in the capital market. The American put therefore will sell for a higher price than \na European put with otherwise identical terms. \n  Figure\u00a021.4 , panel A illustrates the value of an American put option as a function of the \ncurrent stock price,  S  0 . Once the stock price drops below a critical value, denoted  S * in \nthe figure, exercise becomes optimal. At that point the option-pricing curve is tangent to the \nstraight line depicting the intrinsic value of the option. If and when the stock price reaches \nS *, the put option is exercised and its payoff equals its intrinsic value.   \nIn contrast, the value of the European put, which is graphed in  Figure\u00a021.4 , panel B, is \nnot asymptotic to the intrinsic value line. Because early exercise is prohibited, the maxi-\nmum value of the European put is PV( X ), which occurs at the point  S  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a00. Obviously, for \na long enough horizon, PV( X ) can be made arbitrarily small.     \nA: American Put Value B: European Put Value\nX X\nS* X X PV(X)S0 S0 PV(X)\nPut Value\nTime\nValue\n Figure 21.4 Put option values as a function of the current stock price  \n In light of this discussion, explain why the put-call parity relationship is valid only for European options on \nnon-dividend-paying stocks.

Nevertheless, we can develop valuable insight into option valuation by considering a simple special case. Assume that a stock price can take only two possible values at option expiration: The stock will either increase to a given higher price or decrease to a given lower price. Although this may seem an extreme simpli-fication, it allows us to come closer to understanding more complicated and realistic mod-els. Moreover, we can extend this approach to describe far more reasonable specifications of stock price behavior. In fact, several major financial firms employ variants of this simple model to value options and securities with optionlike features. \n Suppose the stock now sells at  S  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$100, and the price will either increase by a factor \nof  u \u00a0 5 \u00a01.20 to $120 ( u  stands for \u201cup\u201d) or fall by a factor of  d \u00a0 5 \u00a0.9 to $90 ( d  stands for \n\u201cdown\u201d) by year-end. A call option on the stock might specify an exercise price of $110 and a time to expiration of 1 year. The interest rate is 10%. At year-end, the payoff to the holder of the call option will be either zero, if the stock falls, or $10, if the stock price goes to $120. \n These possibilities are illustrated by the following value \u201ctrees\u201d:     \n 120 10\n 100 C\n   90   0\n Stock price Call option value\n Compare the payoff of the call to that of a portfolio consisting of one share of the \nstock and borrowing of $81.82 at the interest rate of 10%. The payoff of this portfolio also depends on the stock price at year-end:\n  Value of stock at year-end  $90  $120 \n    2  \u00a0Repayment of loan with interest       2  90       2  90  \n    TOTAL   $  0  $  30 \nWe know the cash outlay to establish the portfolio is $18.18: $100 for the stock, less the \n$81.82 proceeds from borrowing. Therefore the portfolio\u2019s value tree is     \n 30\n 18.18   0\n The payoff of this portfolio is exactly three times that of the call option for either value \nof the stock price. In other words, three call options will exactly replicate the payoff to the \nportfolio; it follows that three call options should have the same price as the cost of estab-lishing the portfolio. Hence the three calls should sell for the same price as this  replicating \nportfolio.  Therefore, \n  3C5\n$18.18\n or each call should sell at  C \u00a0 5 \u00a0$6.06. Thus, given the stock price, exercise price, interest \nrate, and volatility of the stock price (as represented by the spread between the up or down movements), we can derive the fair value for the call option. \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   729bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   729 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n730 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n This valuation approach relies heavily on the notion of replication. With only two pos-\nsible end-of-year values of the stock, the payoffs to the levered stock portfolio replicate the \npayoffs to three call options and, therefore, command the same market price. Replication is behind most option-pricing formulas. For more complex price distributions for stocks, the replication technique is correspondingly more complex, but the principles remain the same. \n One way to view the role of replication is to note that, using the numbers assumed for \nthis example, a portfolio made up of one share of stock and three call options written is perfectly hedged. Its year-end value is independent of the ultimate stock price:\n  Stock value  $90  $120 \n    2  \u00a0Obligations from\u00a03\u00a0calls written      2  0      2  30  \n   Net payoff  $90  $  90 \nThe investor has formed a riskless portfolio, with a payout of $90. Its value must be the \npresent value of $90, or $90/1.10\u00a0 5 \u00a0$81.82. The value of the portfolio, which equals $100 \nfrom the stock held long, minus 3 C  from the three calls written, should equal $81.82. \nHence $100\u00a0 2 \u00a03 C \u00a0 5 \u00a0$81.82, or  C \u00a0 5 \u00a0$6.06. \n The ability to create a perfect hedge is the key to this argument. The hedge locks in the \nend-of-year payout, which therefore can be discounted using the  risk-free  interest rate. To \nfind the value of the option in terms of the value of the stock, we do not need to know either the option\u2019s or the stock\u2019s beta or expected rate of return. The perfect hedging, or replica-tion, approach enables us to express the value of the option in terms of the current value of the stock without this information. With a hedged position, the final stock price does not affect the investor\u2019s payoff, so the stock\u2019s risk and return parameters have no bearing. \n The hedge ratio of this example is one share of stock to three calls, or one-third. This \nratio has an easy interpretation in this context: It is the ratio of the range of the values of the option to those of the stock across the two possible outcomes. The stock, which originally sells for  S  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0100, will be worth either  d \u00a0 3 \u00a0$100\u00a0 5 \u00a0$90 or  u \u00a0 3 \u00a0$100\u00a0 5 \u00a0$120, for a range of \n$30. If the stock price increases, the call will be worth  C   u  \u00a0 5 \u00a0$10, whereas if the stock price \ndecreases, the call will be worth  C   d  \u00a0 5 \u00a00, for a range of $10. The ratio of ranges, 10/30, is \none-third, which is the hedge ratio we have established. \n The hedge ratio equals the ratio of ranges because the option and stock are perfectly \ncorrelated in this two-state example. Because they are perfectly correlated, a perfect hedge \nrequires that they be held in a fraction determined only by relative volatility. \n We can generalize the hedge ratio for other two-state option problems as \n  H5Cu2Cd\nuS02dS0 \nwhere  C   u   or  C   d   refers to the call option\u2019s value when the stock goes up or down, respec-\ntively, and  uS  0  and  dS  0  are the stock prices in the two states. The hedge ratio,  H,  is the \nratio of the swings in the possible end-of-period values of the option and the stock. If the \ninvestor writes one option and holds  H  shares of stock, the value of the portfolio will be \nunaffected by the stock price. In this case, option pricing is easy: Simply set the value of the hedged portfolio equal to the present value of the known payoff. \n Using our example, the option-pricing technique would proceed as follows:\n    1. Given the possible end-of-year stock prices,  uS  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0120 and  dS  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a090, and the \nexercise price of 110, calculate that  C   u  \u00a0 5 \u00a010 and  C   d  \u00a0 5 \u00a00. The stock price range \nis 30, while the option price range is 10.  \n   2.

Note, by the way, that the present value of the profit to the arbitrage strategy above exactly equals three times the amount by which the option is overpriced. The present value of the risk-free profit of $1.45 at a 10% interest rate is $1.318. With three options written in the strategy above, this translates to a profit of $.44 per option, exactly the amount by which the option was overpriced: $6.50 versus the \u201cfair value\u201d of $6.06. \n  \n Suppose the call option had been underpriced, selling at $5.50. Formulate the arbitrage strategy to exploit \nthe mispricing, and show that it provides a riskless cash flow in 1 year of $.6167 per option purchased. Compare the present value of this cash flow to the option mispricing.  CONCEPT CHECK 21.3 \n  Generalizing the Two-State Approach \n Although the two-state stock price model seems simplistic, we can generalize it to incor-\nporate more realistic assumptions. To start, suppose we were to break up the year into two 6-month segments, and then assert that over each half-year segment the stock price could take on two values. In this example, we will say it can increase 10% (i.e.,  u \u00a0 5 \u00a01.10) \nor decrease 5% (i.e.,  d \u00a0 5 \u00a0.95). A stock initially selling at 100 could follow these possible \npaths over the course of the year:     \n  121\n 110  100 104.50   95\n   90.25\nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   731bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   731 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n732 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nThe midrange value of 104.50 can be attained by two paths: an increase of 10% followed \nby a decrease of 5%, or a decrease of 5% followed by a 10% increase. \n There are now three possible end-of-year values for the stock and three for the option:     \n C uu\n C u\n C C ud\u00a05\u00a0C du\n C d\n C dd\n Using methods similar to those we followed above, we could value  C   u   from knowl-\nedge of  C   uu   and  C   ud  , then value  C   d   from knowledge of  C   du   and  C   dd  , and finally value  C  \nfrom knowledge of  C   u   and  C   d  . And there is no reason to stop at 6-month intervals. We \ncould next break the year into four 3-month units, or twelve 1-month units, or 365 1-day \nunits, each of which would be posited to have a two-state process. Although the calcula-tions become quite numerous and correspondingly tedious, they are easy to program into a computer, and such computer programs are used widely by participants in the options market.  \n  \n Suppose that the risk-free interest rate is 5% per 6-month period and we wish to \nvalue a call option with exercise price $110 on the stock described in the two-period price tree just above. We start by finding the value of  C  \n u  . From this point, the call can \nrise to an expiration-date value of  C   uu  \u00a0 5 \u00a0$11 (because at this point the stock price is \n u \u00a0 3 \u00a0 u \u00a0 3 \u00a0 S  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$121) or fall to a final value of  C   ud  \u00a0 5 \u00a00 (because at this point, the stock \nprice is  u \u00a0 3 \u00a0 d \u00a0 3 \u00a0 S  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$104.50, which is less than the $110 exercise price).

It is easy to see that this value must be zero. If we reach \nthis point (corresponding to a stock price of $95), the stock price at option expiration \nwill be either $104.50 or $90.25; in either case, the option will expire out of the money.

For example, when we increase the number of subperiods to three, the number of possible stock prices increases to four, as demonstrated in the following stock price tree:     \n  u3S0\n u2S0\n uS0 u2dS0 S 0 udS 0\n dS0 ud2S0\n d2S0\n d3S0\n Thus, by allowing for an ever-greater number of subperiods, we can overcome one of the apparent limitations of the valuation model: that the number of possible end-of-period stock prices is small. \n Notice that extreme events such as  u  \n3  S  0  or  d  3  S  0  are relatively rare, as they require either \nthree consecutive increases or decreases in the three subintervals. More moderate, or mid-range, results such as  u  \n2  dS  0  can be arrived at by more than one path\u2014any combination of \ntwo price increases and one decrease will result in stock price  u  2  dS  0 . There are three of \nthese paths:  uud, udu, duu.  In contrast, only one path,  uuu,  results in a stock price of  u  3  S  0 . \nThus midrange values are more likely. As we make the model more realistic and break up the option maturity into more and more subperiods, the probability distribution for the final stock price begins to resemble the familiar bell-shaped curve with highly unlikely extreme outcomes and far more likely midrange outcomes. The probability of each out-come is given by the binomial probability distribution, and this multiperiod approach to option pricing is therefore called the    binomial model.    \n But we still need to answer an important practical question. Before the binomial \nmodel can be used to value actual options, we need a way to choose reasonable val-ues for  u  and  d.  The spread between up and down movements in the price of the stock \nreflects the volatility of its rate of return, so the choice for  u  and  d  should depend on \nthat volatility. Call  s  your estimate of the standard deviation of the stock\u2019s continuously \ncompounded annualized rate of return, and \u0394 t  the length of each subperiod. To make \nthe standard deviation of the stock in the binomial model match your estimate of  s , it \nturns out that you can set    u5exp(s\"Dt\n)  and    d5exp(2s\"Dt).   3   You can see that the  Show that the initial value of the call option in Example 21.1 is $4.434. \n     a.  Confirm that the spread in option values is  C   u  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 C   d  \u00a0 5 \u00a0$6.984.  \n    b.  Confirm that the spread in stock values is  uS  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 dS  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$15.  \n    c.  Confirm that the hedge ratio is .4656 shares purchased for each call written.  \n    d.  Demonstrate that the value in one period of a portfolio comprised of .4656 shares and one call \n written is riskless.  \n    e.  Calculate the present value of this payoff.  \n    f.

This makes sense, as both higher  s  and longer holding \nperiods make future stock prices more uncertain. The following example illustrates how \nto use this calibration.   \n  4 Using this probability, the continuously compounded expected rate of return on the stock is .10. In general, \nthe formula relating the probability of an upward movement with the annual expected rate of return,  r,  is \n   p5exp(rDt)2d\nu2d.   Suppose you are using a 3-period model to value a 1-year option on a stock with \nvolatility (i.e., annualized standard deviation) of  s \u00a0 5 \u00a0.30. With a time to expiration of \n T \u00a0 5 \u00a0 1 year, and three subperiods, you would calculate    Dt5T/n51/3, u5exp(s\"Dt)5 \nexp (.30\" 1/3)51.189  and    d5exp(2s\"Dt)5exp(2.30\" 1/3)5.841.   Given the \nprobability of an up movement, you could then work out the probability of any final \nstock price. For example, suppose the probability that the stock price increases is .554 and the probability that it decreases is .446.  \n4   Then the probability of stock prices at the \nend of the year would be as follows:   \n We plot this probability distribution in  Figure\u00a021.5 , panel A. Notice that the two middle \nend-of-period stock prices are, in fact, more likely than either extreme.

In fact, as the number of intervals increases, the distribution progressively \napproaches the skewed log-normal (rather than the symmetric normal) distribution. Even \nif the stock price were to decline in  each  subinterval, it can never drop below zero. But \nthere is no corresponding upper bound on its potential performance. This  asymmetry \ngives rise to the skewness of the distribution. \n Eventually, as we divide the option maturity into an ever-greater number of subintervals, \neach node of the event tree would correspond to an infinitesimally small time interval. The \npossible stock price movement within that time interval would be correspondingly small. \nAs those many intervals passed, the end-of-period stock price would more and more closely \n  5 We adjust the probabilities of up versus down movements using the formula in footnote 4 to make the distribu-\ntions in  Figure\u00a021.5  comparable.

Then, at the end of that interval, on reaching the next node, a new \nhedge ratio could be computed and the portfolio composition could be revised to remain \n  6 Actually, more complex considerations enter here. The limit of this process is lognormal only if we assume \nalso that stock prices move continuously, by which we mean that over small time intervals only small price \nmovements can occur. This rules out rare events such as sudden, extreme price moves in response to dramatic information (like a takeover attempt). For a treatment of this type of \u201cjump process,\u201d see John C. Cox and Stephen A. Ross, \u201cThe Valuation of Options for Alternative Stochastic Processes,\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics  3 \n(January\u2013March 1976), pp. 145\u201366, or Robert C. Merton, \u201cOption Pricing When Underlying Stock Returns Are Discontinuous,\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics  3 (January\u2013March 1976), pp. 125\u201344.   A Risk-Neutral Shortcut \n We pointed out earlier in the chapter that the binomial \nmodel valuation approach is arbitrage-based. We can value the option by replicating it with shares of stock plus bor-rowing. The ability to replicate the option means that its price relative to the stock and the interest rate must be based only on the technology of replication and  not  on risk \npreferences. It cannot depend on risk aversion or the capi-tal asset pricing model or any other model of equilibrium risk-return relationships. \n This insight\u2014that the pricing model must be inde-\npendent of risk aversion\u2014leads to a very useful shortcut \nto valuing options. Imagine a  risk-neutral economy,  that \nis, an economy in which all investors are risk-neutral. This hypothetical economy must value options the same as our real one because risk aversion cannot affect the valuation formula. \n In a risk-neutral economy, investors would not \ndemand risk premiums and would therefore value all \nassets by discounting expected payoffs at the risk-free rate of interest. Therefore, a security such as a call option would be valued by discounting its expected cash flow \nat the risk-free rate:    \n\u201cE\u201d(CF)\nC 5\n11rf . We put the expectation \noperator  E  in quotation marks to signify that this is not \nthe true expectation, but the expectation that would \nprevail in the hypothetical risk-neutral economy. To be \nconsistent, we must calculate this expected cash flow \nusing the rate of return the stock  would  have in the risk-\nneutral economy,  not  using its true rate of return. But \nif we successfully maintain consistency, the value derived for the hypothetical economy should match the one in our own. \n How do we compute the expected cash flow from the \noption in the risk-neutral economy? Because there are no \nrisk premiums, the stock\u2019s expected rate of return must equal the risk-free rate. Call  p  the probability that the \nstock price increases. Then  p  must be chosen to equate the \nexpected rate of increase of the stock price to the risk-free rate (we ignore dividends here): \n\u201cE\u201d(S\n1)\u00a05\u00a0p(uS)\u00a01\u00a0(1\u00a02\u00a0p)dS\u00a05\u00a0(1\u00a01\u00a0r f)S   This implies that     p511rf2d\nu2d. We call  p  a  risk-neutral \nprobability  to distinguish it from the true, or \u201cobjective,\u201d \nprobability. To illustrate, in our two-state example at the \nbeginning of Section 21.2, we had  u \u00a0 5 \u00a0 1.2,\u00a0  d \u00a0 5 \u00a0 .9, and \n r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a0.10. Given these values,    p511.102.9\n1.22.952\n3.   \n Now let\u2019s see what happens if we use the discounted \ncash flow formula to value the option in the risk-neutral \neconomy. We continue to use the two-state example from Section 21.2. We find the present value of the option pay-off using the risk-neutral probability and discount at the risk-free interest rate: \n  \n\u201cE\u201d(CF)\nC 5\n11rfp Cu1(12p) C d5\n11rf2/3310 1 1/3 30\n5\n1.106.065\n This answer exactly matches the value we found using our \nno-arbitrage approach! \n We repeat: This is not truly an expected discounted value. \n    \u2022  The  numerator  is not the true expected cash flow from \nthe option because we use the risk-neutral probability, \n p,  rather than the true probability.  \n   \u2022  The  denominator  is not the proper discount rate for \noption cash flows because we do not account for \nthe\u00a0risk.  \n   \u2022  In a sense, these two \u201cerrors\u201d cancel out. But this is not just luck: We are  assured  to get the correct result \nbecause the no-arbitrage approach implies that risk preferences cannot affect the option value. Therefore, the value computed for the risk-neutral economy  must  \nequal the value that we obtain in our economy.   \n When we move to the more realistic multiperiod \nmodel, the calculations are more cumbersome, but the \nidea is the same. Footnote 4 shows how to relate  p  to any \nexpected rate of return and volatility estimate. Simply set the expected rate of return on the stock equal to the risk-free rate, use the resulting probability to work out the expected payoff from the option, discount at the risk-free rate, and you will find the option value. These calculations are actually fairly easy to program in Excel.

By continuously revising the hedge position, the \nportfolio would remain hedged and would earn a riskless rate of return over each inter-val. This is called  dynamic hedging,  the continued updating of the hedge ratio as time \npasses. As the dynamic hedge becomes ever finer, the resulting option-valuation proce-dure becomes more precise. The nearby box offers further refinements on the use of the binomial model. \n     \n In the table in Example 21.3,  u  and  d  both get closer to 1 ( u  is smaller and  d  is larger) as the time interval \n\u0394 t  shrinks. Why does this make sense? Does the fact that  u  and  d  are each closer to 1 mean that the total \nvolatility of the stock over the remaining life of the option is lower?  CONCEPT CHECK 21.5 \n   21.4 Black-Scholes Option Valuation  \n While the binomial model is extremely flexible, a computer is needed for it to be useful in \nactual trading. An option-pricing  formula  would be far easier to use than the tedious algo-\nrithm involved in the binomial model. It turns out that such a formula can be derived if one is willing to make just two more assumptions: that both the risk-free interest rate and stock price volatility are constant over the life of the option. In this case, as the time to expira-tion is divided into ever-more subperiods, the distribution of the stock price at expiration progressively approaches the lognormal distribution, as suggested by  Figure\u00a021.5 . When the stock price distribution is actually lognormal, we can derive an exact option-pricing formula.  \n   The Black-Scholes Formula \n Financial economists searched for years for a workable option-pricing model before Black and Scholes  \n7   and Merton  8   derived a formula for the value of a call option. Scholes \nand Merton shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics for their accomplishment.  9   N o w  \nwidely used by options market participants, the    Black-Scholes pricing formula    for a \ncall option is  \n   C05S0N(d1)2Xe2rTN(d2)  (21.1)  \nwhere\n      d15ln(S0/X)1(r1s2/2)T\ns\"T   \n     d25d12s\"T    \n  7 Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, \u201cThe Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities,\u201d  Journal of Political \nEconomy  81 (May\u2013June 1973). \n   8 Robert C.

In a sense, this information is already built into the \nformula with the inclusion of the stock price, which itself depends on the stock\u2019s risk \nand return characteristics. This version of the Black-Scholes formula is predicated on the \nassumption that the stock pays no dividends. \n Although you may find the Black-Scholes formula intimidating, we can explain it at \na somewhat intuitive level. The trick is to view the  N ( d ) terms (loosely) as risk-adjusted \nprobabilities that the call option will expire in the money. First, look at Equation 21.1 \nassuming both  N ( d ) terms are close to 1.0, that is, when there is a very high probability \nthe option will be exercised. Then the call option value is equal to  S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 Xe   2  rT  , which \nis what we called earlier the adjusted intrinsic value,  S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0PV( X ). This makes sense; if \nexercise is certain, we have a claim on a stock with current value  S  0 , and an obligation \nwith present value PV( X ), or, with continu-\nous compounding,  Xe   2  rT  . \n Now look at Equation 21.1 assuming the \n N ( d ) terms are close to zero, meaning the \noption almost certainly will not be exercised. \nThen the equation confirms that the call is \nworth nothing. For middle-range values of \n N ( d ) between 0 and 1, Equation 21.1 tells us \nthat the call value can be viewed as the present \nvalue of the call\u2019s potential payoff adjusting \nfor the probability of in-the-money expiration. \n How do the  N ( d ) terms serve as risk-\nadjusted probabilities? This question quickly \nleads us into advanced statistics. Notice, \nhowever, that ln( S  0 / X ), which appears in the \nnumerator of  d  1  and  d  2 , is approximately the \npercentage amount by which the option is cur-\nrently in or out of the money. For example, if \n S  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0105 and  X \u00a0 5 \u00a0100, the option is 5% in the \nN(d) = Shaded area\nd0\n Figure 21.6 A standard normal curve  \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   738bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   738 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 21 Option Valuation 739\nmoney, and ln(105/100)\u00a0 5 \u00a0.049.

The denominator,    s \"T,  adjusts the amount by which the option \nis in or out of the money for the volatility of the stock price over the remaining life of the \noption. An option in the money by a given percent is more likely to stay in the money if both stock price volatility and time to expiration are low. Therefore,  N ( d  \n1 ) and  N ( d  2 ) \nincrease with the probability that the option will expire in the money. \n You can use the Black-Scholes formula fairly easily. Suppose you want to value a call \noption under the following circumstances:\n   Stock price:      S  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0100  \n  Exercise price:      X \u00a0 5 \u00a095  \n  Interest rate:      r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.10 (10% per year)  \n  Time to expiration:      T \u00a0 5 \u00a0.25 (3 months or one-quarter of a year)  \n  Standard deviation:      s \u00a0 5 \u00a0.50 (50% per year)   \nFirst calculate \n  ln(100 / 95) 1 (.10 1 .52/ 2).25.43\n.5\u221a.25d1 55\n d25.432.5\".255.18 \nNext find  N ( d  1 ) and  N ( d  2 ). The values of the normal distribution are tabulated and may \nbe found in many statistics textbooks. A table of  N ( d ) is provided here as  Table\u00a021.2 . \nThe normal distribution function,  N ( d ), is also provided in any spreadsheet program. In \nMicrosoft Excel, for example, the function name is NORMSDIST. Using either Excel or \n Table\u00a021.2  we find that \nN(.43)\u00a05\u00a0.6664\nN(.18)\u00a05\u00a0.5714\n Thus the value of the call option is \n   C51003.6664295e2.103.253.5714\n 566.64252.945$13.70    Example 21.4 Black-Scholes Valuation \n Recalculate the value of the call option in Example 21.4 using a standard deviation of .6 instead of .5. \nConfirm that the option is worth more using the higher stock-return volatility.  CONCEPT CHECK 21.6 \n   What if the option price in Example 21.4 were $15 rather than $13.70? Is the option \nmispriced? Maybe, but before betting your fortune on that, you may want to reconsider \nthe valuation analysis. First, like all models, the Black-Scholes formula is based on some simplifying abstractions that make the formula only approximately valid. \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   739bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   739 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 4 0 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n  d    N  (  d  )    d    N  (  d  )    d    N  (  d  )    d    N  (  d  )    d    N  (  d  )    d    N  (  d  )  \n  2 3.00  .0013   2 1.58  .0571   2 0.76  .2236  0.06  .5239  0.86  .8051  1.66  .9515 \n  2 2.95  .0016   2 1.56  .0594   2 0.74  .2297  0.08  .5319  0.88  .8106  1.68  .9535 \n  2 2.90  .0019   2 1.54  .0618   2 0.72  .2358  0.10  .5398  0.90  .8159  1.70  .9554 \n  2 2.85  .0022   2 1.52  .0643   2 0.70  .2420  0.12  .5478  0.92  .8212  1.72  .9573 \n  2 2.80  .0026   2 1.50  .0668   2 0.68  .2483  0.14  .5557  0.94  .8264  1.74  .9591 \n  2 2.75  .0030   2 1.48  .0694   2 0.66  .2546  0.16  .5636  0.96  .8315  1.76  .9608 \n  2 2.70  .0035   2 1.46  .0721   2 0.64  .2611  0.18  .5714  0.98  .8365  1.78  .9625 \n  2 2.65  .0040   2 1.44  .0749   2 0.62  .2676  0.20  .5793  1.00  .8414  1.80  .9641 \n  2 2.60  .0047   2 1.42  .0778   2 0.60  .2743  0.22  .5871  1.02  .8461  1.82  .9656 \n  2 2.55  .0054   2 1.40  .0808   2 0.58  .2810  0.24  .5948  1.04  .8508  1.84  .9671 \n  2 2.50  .0062   2 1.38  .0838   2 0.56  .2877  0.26  .6026  1.06  .8554  1.86  .9686 \n  2 2.45  .0071   2 1.36  .0869   2 0.54  .2946  0.28  .6103  1.08  .8599  1.88  .9699 \n  2 2.40  .0082   2 1.34  .0901   2 0.52  .3015  0.30  .6179  1.10  .8643  1.90  .9713 \n  2 2.35  .0094   2 1.32  .0934   2 0.50  .3085  0.32  .6255  1.12  .8686  1.92  .9726 \n  2 2.30  .0107   2 1.30  .0968   2 0.48  .3156  0.34  .6331  1.14  .8729  1.94  .9738 \n  2 2.25  .0122   2 1.28  .1003   2 0.46  .3228  0.36  .6406  1.16  .8770  1.96  .9750 \n  2 2.20  .0139   2 1.26  .1038   2 0.44  .3300  0.38  .6480  1.18  .8810  1.98  .9761 \n  2 2.15  .0158   2 1.24  .1075   2 0.42  .3373  0.40  .6554  1.20  .8849  2.00  .9772 \n  2 2.10  .0179   2 1.22  .1112   2 0.40  .3446  0.42  .6628  1.22  .8888  2.05  .9798 \n  2 2.05  .0202   2 1.20  .1151   2 0.38  .3520  0.44  .6700  1.24  .8925  2.10  .9821 \n  2 2.00  .0228   2 1.18  .1190   2 0.36  .3594  0.46  .6773  1.26  .8962  2.15  .9842 \n  2 1.98  .0239   2 1.16  .1230   2 0.34  .3669  0.48  .6844  1.28  .8997  2.20  .9861 \n  2 1.96  .0250   2 1.14  .1271   2 0.32  .3745  0.50  .6915  1.30  .9032  2.25  .9878 \n  2 1.94  .0262   2 1.12  .1314   2 0.30  .3821  0.52  .6985  1.32  .9066  2.30  .9893 \n  2 1.92  .0274   2 1.10  .1357   2 0.28  .3897  0.54  .7054  1.34  .9099  2.35  .9906 \n  2 1.90  .0287   2 1.08  .1401   2 0.26  .3974  0.56  .7123  1.36  .9131  2.40  .9918 \n  2 1.88  .0301   2 1.06  .1446   2 0.24  .4052  0.58  .7191  1.38  .9162  2.45  .9929 \n  2 1.86  .0314   2 1.04  .1492   2 0.22  .4129  0.60  .7258  1.40  .9192  2.50  .9938 \n  2 1.84  .0329   2 1.02  .1539   2 0.20  .4207  0.62  .7324  1.42  .9222  2.55  .9946 \n  2 1.82  .0344   2 1.00  .1587   2 0.18  .4286  0.64  .7389  1.44  .9251  2.60  .9953 \n  2 1.80  .0359   2 0.98  .1635   2 0.16  .4365  0.66  .7454  1.46  .9279  2.65  .9960 \n  2 1.78  .0375   2 0.96  .1685   2 0.14  .4443  0.68  .7518  1.48  .9306  2.70  .9965 \n  2 1.76  .0392   2 0.94  .1736   2 0.12  .4523  0.70  .7580  1.50  .9332  2.75  .9970 \n  2 1.74  .0409   2 0.92  .1788   2 0.10  .4602  0.72  .7642  1.52  .9357  2.80  .9974 \n  2 1.72  .0427   2 0.90  .1841   2 0.08  .4681  0.74  .7704  1.54  .9382  2.85  .9978 \n  2 1.70  .0446   2 0.88  .1894   2 0.06  .4761  0.76  .7764  1.56  .9406  2.90  .9981 \n  2 1.68  .0465   2 0.86  .1949   2 0.04  .4841  0.78  .7823  1.58  .9429  2.95  .9984 \n  2 1.66  .0485   2 0.84  .2005   2 0.02  .4920  0.80  .7882  1.60  .9452  3.00  .9986 \n  2 1.64  .0505   2 0.82  .2061    0.00  .5000  0.82  .7939  1.62  .9474  3.05  .9989 \n  2 1.62  .0526   2 0.80  .2119    0.02  .5080  0.84  .7996  1.64  .9495     \n  2 1.60  .0548   2 0.78  .2177    0.04  .5160             \n Table 21.2 \n Cumulative normal distribution \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   740bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   740 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 21 Option Valuation 741\n Some of the important assumptions underlying the formula are the following:\n    1. The stock will pay no dividends until after the option expiration date.  \n   2. Both the interest rate,  r,  and variance rate,  s  2 , of the stock are constant (or in \nslightly more general versions of the formula, both are  known  functions of time\u2014\nany changes are perfectly predictable).  \n   3. Stock prices are continuous, meaning that sudden extreme jumps such as those in \nthe aftermath of an announcement of a takeover attempt are ruled out.    \n Variants of the Black-Scholes formula have been developed to deal with many of these \nlimitations. \n Second, even within the context of the Black-Scholes model, you must be sure of \nthe accuracy of the parameters used in the formula. Four of these\u2014 S  0 ,  X,   T,   and  r \u2014are \nstraightforward. The stock price, exercise price, and time to expiration are readily deter-mined. The interest rate used is the money market rate for a maturity equal to that of the option, and the dividend payout is reasonably predictable, at least over short horizons. \n The last input, though, the standard deviation of the stock return, is not directly observ-\nable. It must be estimated from historical data, from scenario analysis, or from the prices of other options, as we will describe momentarily. \n We saw in Chapter 5 that the historical variance of stock market returns can be calcu-\nlated from  n  observations as follows: \n  s\n25n\nn21an\nt51(rt2r)2\nn \nwhere    r  is the average return over the sample period. The rate of return on day  t  is defined \nto be consistent with continuous compounding as  r   t  \u00a0 5 \u00a0ln( S   t  / S   t  2 1 ). [We note again that the \nnatural logarithm of a ratio is approximately the percentage difference between the numer-\nator and denominator so that ln( S   t  / S   t  2 1 ) is a measure of the rate of return of the stock from \ntime  t \u00a0 2 \u00a01 to time  t. ] Historical variance commonly is computed using daily returns over \nperiods of several months. Because the volatility of stock returns must be estimated, how-\never, it is always possible that discrepancies between an option price and its Black-Scholes value are simply artifacts of error in the estimation of the stock\u2019s volatility. \n In fact, market participants often give the option-valuation problem a different twist. \nRather than calculating a Black-Scholes option value for a given stock\u2019s standard devia-tion, they ask instead: What standard deviation would be necessary for the option price that I observe to be consistent with the Black-Scholes formula? This is called the    implied vola-\ntility    of the option, the volatility level for the stock implied by the option price.  \n10   Investors \ncan then judge whether they think the actual stock standard deviation exceeds the implied volatility. If it does, the option is considered a good buy; if actual volatility seems greater than the implied volatility, its fair price would exceed the observed price.\n   \n Another variation is to compare two options on the same stock with equal expiration \ndates but different exercise prices. The option with the higher implied volatility would be considered relatively expensive, because a higher standard deviation is required to justify its price. The analyst might consider buying the option with the lower implied volatility and writing the option with the higher implied volatility. \n The Black-Scholes valuation formula, as well as the implied volatility, is easily calcu-\nlated using an Excel spreadsheet like  Spreadsheet 21.1 . The model inputs are provided in \n  10 This concept was introduced in Richard E. Schmalensee and Robert R.

The formulas for  d  1  and  d  2  are provided \nin the spreadsheet, and the Excel formula NORMSDIST( d  1 ) is used to calculate  N ( d  1 ).  11\nCell E6 contains the Black-Scholes formula. (The formula in the spreadsheet actually \nincludes an adjustment for dividends, as described in the next section.)     \nTo compute an implied volatility, we can use the Goal Seek command from the What-If \nAnalysis menu (which can be found under the Data tab) in Excel. See  Figure\u00a021.7  for an \nillustration. Goal Seek asks us to change the value of one cell to make the value of another \ncell (called the  target cell  ) equal to a specific value. For example, if we observe a call \noption selling for $7 with other inputs as given in the spreadsheet, we can use Goal Seek \nto change the value in cell B2 (the standard deviation of the stock) to set the option value \nin cell E6 equal to $7. The target cell, E6, is the call price, and the spreadsheet manipulates \ncell B2. When you click  OK,  the spreadsheet finds that a standard deviation equal to .2783 \nis consistent with a call price of $7; this would be the option\u2019s implied volatility if it were \nselling at $7.\n Spreadsheet 21.1\nSpreadsheet to calculate Black-Scholes call    option values     eXcel\nPlease visit us at \nwww.mhhe.com/bkmAC DE\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7B\nINPUTS\nStandard deviation (annual)\nMaturity (in years)\nRisk-free rate (annual)\nStock price\nExercise price\nDividend yield (annual)FORMULA FOR OUTPUT IN COLUMN E\n(LN(B5/B6)+(B4\u2013B7+.5*B2^2)*B3)/(B2*SQRT(B3))\nE2\u2013B2*SQRT(B3)\nNORMSDIST(E2)\nNORMSDIST(E3)\nB5*EXP(\u2013B7*B3)*E4\u2013B6*EXP(\u2013B4*B3)*E5\nB6*EXP(\u2013B4*B3)*(1\u2013E5)\u2013B5*EXP(\u2013B7*B3)*(1\u2013E4)OUTPUTS\nd1\nd2\nN(d1)\nN(d2)\nB/S call value\nB/S put value0.2783\n0.5\n0.06\n100\n105\n0FG H I J\n0.0029\n\u20130.1939\n0.5012\n0.4231\n7.0000\n8.8968\n11 In some versions of Excel, the function is NORM.S.DIST( d, TRUE).

Figure\u00a0 21.8  is \na graph of the implied (30-day) volatility \nof the S&P 500 since 1990. During peri-\nods of turmoil, implied volatility can spike \nquickly. Notice the peaks in January 1991 \n(Gulf War), August 1998 (collapse of Long-\nTerm Capital Management), September 11, \n2001, 2002 (build-up to invasion of Iraq), \nand, most dramatically, during the credit cri-\nsis of 2008. Because implied volatility cor-\nrelates with crisis, it is sometimes called an \n\u201cinvestor fear gauge.\u201d\n A futures contract on the 30-day implied \nvolatility of the S&P 500 has traded on the \nCBOE Futures Exchange since 2004. The \npayoff of the contract depends on market \nimplied volatility at the expiration of the contract. The ticker symbol of the contract is VIX.  \nAs the nearby box makes clear, observers use it to infer the market\u2019s assessment of possible \nstock price swings in coming months. In this case, the article questioned the relatively low level \nof the VIX in light of tense political negotiations at the end of 2012 over the so-called fiscal \ncliff. The question was whether the price of the VIX contract indicated that investors were being \ntoo complacent about the potential for market disruption if those negotiations were to fail.  \n  Figure\u00a0 21.8  reveals an awkward empirical fact. While the Black-Scholes formula is \nderived assuming that stock volatility is constant, the time series of implied volatilities \nderived from that formula is in fact far from constant. This contradiction reminds us that \nthe Black-Scholes model (like all models) is a simplification that does not capture all \naspects of real markets. In this particular context, extensions of the pricing model that \nallow stock volatility to evolve randomly over time would be desirable, and, in fact, many \nextensions of the model along these lines have been developed.  12     \n The fact that volatility changes unpredictably means that it can be difficult to choose \nthe proper volatility input to use in any option-pricing model. A considerable amount of \nrecent research has been devoted to techniques to predict changes in volatility. These tech-\nniques, known as  ARCH   and  stochastic volatility   models, posit that changes in volatility \nare partially predictable and that by analyzing recent levels and trends in volatility, one can \nimprove predictions of future volatility.  13      \nGulf WarLTCM\n9/11IraqSubprime and \nCredit Crises\nU.S. Debt \nDowngrade\n010203040506070\nJan-91Jan-90\nJan-92\nJan-93\nJan-94\nJan-95\nJan-96\nJan-97\nJan-98\nJan-99\nJan-00\nJan-01\nJan-02\nJan-03\nJan-04\nJan-05\nJan-06\nJan-07\nJan-08\nJan-09\nJan-10\nJan-11\nJan-12\nJan-13Implied Volatility (%)\n Figure 21.8 Implied volatility of the S&P 500 (VIX index)   \nSource: Chicago Board Options Exchange,   www.cboe.com   .  \n Suppose the call option in Spreadsheet 21.1 actually is selling for $8.

When dividends are to be paid before the option expires, we need to adjust the formula. The payment of dividends raises the possibility of early exercise, and for most realistic dividend payout schemes the valuation formula becomes significantly more com-plex than the Black-Scholes equation. \n We can apply some simple rules of thumb to approximate the option value, however. \nOne popular approach, originally suggested by Black, calls for adjusting the stock price downward by the present value of any dividends that are to be paid before option expi-ration.  \n14   Therefore, we would simply replace  S  0  with  S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0PV(dividends) in the Black-\nScholes formula. Such an adjustment will take dividends into account by reflecting their eventual impact on the stock price. The option value then may be computed as before, assuming that the option will be held to expiration.   \n In one special case, the dividend adjustment takes a simple form. Suppose the underlying \nasset pays a continuous flow of income. This might be a reasonable assumption for options on a stock index, where different stocks in the index pay dividends on different days, so that dividend income arrives in a more or less continuous flow. If the dividend yield, denoted  d , is \nconstant, one can show that the present value of that dividend flow accruing until the option expiration date is  S  \n0 \u00a0(1\u00a0 2  \u00a0 e   2  d  T  ). (For intuition, notice that  e   2  d  T   approximately equals 1\u00a0 2 \u00a0 d  T,  \nso the value of the dividend is approximately  d  TS  0 .) In this case,  S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0PV(Div)\u00a0 5  \u00a0 S  0 \u00a0 e   2  d  T  , and \nwe can derive a Black-Scholes call option formula on the dividend-paying asset simply by \nsubstituting  S  0 \u00a0 e   2  d  T   for  S  0  in the original formula. This approach is used in Spreadsheet 21.1. \n These procedures yield a very good approximation of option value for European call \noptions that must be held until expiration, but they do not allow for the fact that the holder \nof an American call option might choose to exercise the option just before a dividend. The current value of a call option, assuming that it will be exercised just before the ex-dividend date, might be greater than the value of the option assuming it will be held until expiration. Although holding the option until expiration allows greater effective time to expiration, \n  14 Fischer Black, \u201cFact and Fantasy in the Use of Options,\u201d  Financial Analysts Journal  31 (July\u2013August 1975).   \u201cFear\u201d Gauge Showing Little of It \n On the floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange \n(CBOE), those who trade in fear have seen little but calm. \n Measures of volatility in U.S. markets are pointing to \nrelative calm, but some investors say the low readings are \na sign of complacency. Unlike the rocky ride in the stock market since the U.S. presidential election, the CBOE\u2019s Volatility Index, or VIX, has registered tranquility. For four months, the so-called fear gauge of financial markets has traded below its two-decade historical average of 20, its longest such streak in more than 5 years. \n Some investors worry that the low readings are a sign \nof complacency, and that the potential for further declines \nin response to unexpected bad news isn\u2019t reflected in stock prices. These investors say various barometers of skittish-ness could tick higher as the year-end deadline nears for an agreement on taxes and spending. That anxiety also would likely be reflected in increased volatility in the stock and commodities markets. \n The VIX is an index calculated from the prices investors \nare willing to pay for options tied to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. As investors become nervous, they are will-\ning to pay more for options, driving up the value of the VIX. \n As market watchers search for clues about whether the \nrelative calm can last, some of them are looking back to \nthe early summer of 2011. Back then, the VIX was trading at levels close to today\u2019s, even though market pundits wor-ried that lawmakers wouldn\u2019t agree to raise the debt ceil-ing. That scenario could have led the U.S. government to default on its debt. \n Within a few weeks, as the debt-ceiling wrangling was \ngoing down to the wire, Standard & Poor\u2019s cut the U.S.\u2019s \nlong-term triple-A credit rating. The VIX nearly tripled to 48 in a span of two weeks. \n \u201cThe whole situation leads me to believe that this lack of \na cushion in the market will lead to wilder shocks\u201d to mar-\nkets if negative events happen, says Michael Palmer of Group One Trading who trades the VIX on the floor of the CBOE.  \n Source: Steven Russolillo and Kaitlyn Kiernan,  The Wall Street Journal,   \nNovember 26, 2012.

The effective annual interest rate is 10%, so that the present value of the dividend is $1/(1.10) \n1/3 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$0.97. Black \nsuggests that we can compute the option value in one of two ways:\n    1. Apply the Black-Scholes formula assuming early exercise, thus using the actual stock \nprice of $20 and a time to expiration of 4 months (the time until the dividend payment).  \n   2. Apply the Black-Scholes formula assuming no early exercise, using the dividend-\nadjusted stock price of $20\u00a0 2 \u00a0$.97\u00a0 5 \u00a0$19.03 and a time to expiration of 6 months.    \n The greater of the two values is the estimate of the option value, recognizing that early \nexercise might be optimal. In other words, the so-called    pseudo-American call option \nvalue    is the maximum of the value derived by assuming that the option will be held until expiration and the value derived by assuming that the option will be exercised just before an ex-dividend date. Even this technique is not exact, however, for it assumes that the option holder makes an irrevocable decision now on when to exercise, when in fact the decision is not binding until exercise notice is given.  \n15      \n  Put Option Valuation \n We have concentrated so far on call option valuation. We can derive Black-Scholes European put option values from call option values using the put-call parity theorem. To value the put option, we simply calculate the value of the corresponding call option in Equation 21.1 from the Black-Scholes formula, and solve for the put option value as \n    P5C1PV(X)2S\n0 \n  5C1Xe2rT2S0  (21.2)  \nWe calculate the present value of the exercise price using continuous compounding to be \nconsistent with the Black-Scholes formula. \n Sometimes, it is easier to work with a put option valuation formula directly. If we sub-\nstitute the Black-Scholes formula for a call in Equation 21.2, we obtain the value of a European put option as \n   P5Xe\n2rT312N(d2)42S0312N(d1)4  (21.3)   \n Using data from Example 21.4 ( C \u00a0 5 \u00a0$13.70,\u00a0 X \u00a0 5 \u00a0$95,\u00a0 S \u00a0 5 \u00a0$100,\u00a0 r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.10,\u00a0 s \u00a0 5 \u00a0.50, and \n T \u00a0 5 \u00a0.25), Equation 21.3 implies that a European put option on that stock with identical \nexercise price and time to expiration is worth \n$95e2.10 3\u00a0.25(1\u00a02\u00a0.5714)\u00a02\u00a0$100(1\u00a02 .6664)\u00a05\u00a0$6.35 Example 21.5 Black-Scholes Put Valuation \n  15 An exact formula for American call valuation on dividend-paying stocks has been developed in Richard Roll, \n\u201cAn Analytic Valuation Formula for Unprotected American Call Options on Stocks with Known Dividends,\u201d \n Journal of Financial Economics  5 (November 1977). The technique has been discussed and revised in \nRobert Geske, \u201cA Note on an Analytical Formula for Unprotected American Call Options on Stocks with Known Dividends,\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics  7 (December 1979), and Robert E. Whaley, \u201cOn the Valuation of \nAmerican Call Options on Stocks with Known Dividends,\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics  9 (June 1981). \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   745bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   745 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n746 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n    Dividends and Put Option Valuation \n Equation 21.2 or 21.3 is valid for European puts on non-dividend-paying stocks. As we did \nfor call options, if the underlying asset pays a dividend, we can find European put values by substituting  S  \n0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0PV(Div) for  S  0 . Cell E7 in Spreadsheet 21.1 allows for a continuous \ndividend flow with a dividend yield of  d . In that case  S  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0PV(Div)\u00a0 5 \u00a0 S  0  e   2  d  T  . \n However, listed put options on stocks are American options that offer the opportunity of \nearly exercise, and we have seen that the right to exercise puts early can turn out to be valu-\nable. This means that an American put option must be worth more than the corresponding European option. Therefore, Equation 21.2 or 21.3 describes only the lower bound on the true value of the American put. However, in many applications the approximation is very accurate.  \n16         Notice that this value is consistent with put-call parity: \nP\u00a05\u00a0C\u00a01\u00a0PV(X )\u00a02\u00a0S 0\u00a05\u00a013.70\u00a01\u00a095e2.10 3\u00a0.25\u00a02\u00a0100\u00a05\u00a06.35\n As we noted traders can do, we might then compare this formula value to the actual put \nprice as one step in formulating a trading strategy. \n  16 For a more complete treatment of American put valuation, see R. Geske and H. E. Johnson, \u201cThe American Put \nValued Analytically,\u201d  Journal of Finance  39 (December 1984), pp. 1511\u201324.    21.5 Using the Black-Scholes Formula \n   Hedge Ratios and the Black-Scholes Formula \n In the last chapter, we considered two investments in FinCorp stock: 100 shares or 1,000 \ncall options. We saw that the call option position was more sensitive to swings in the stock price than was the all-stock position. To analyze the overall exposure to a stock price more precisely, however, it is necessary to quantify these relative sensitivities. We can summa-rize the overall exposure of portfolios of options with various exercise prices and times to expiration using the    hedge ratio    ,  the change in option price for a $1 increase in the stock \nprice. A call option, therefore, has a positive hedge ratio and a put option a negative hedge ratio. The hedge ratio is commonly called the option\u2019s    delta    .  \n If you were to graph the option value as a function of the stock value, as we have done \nfor a call option in  Figure\u00a021.9 , the hedge ratio is simply the slope of the curve evaluated at the current stock price. For example, suppose the slope of the curve at  S  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$120 equals .60. \nAs the stock increases in value by $1, the option increases by approximately $.60, as the figure shows.   \nFor every call option written, .60 share of stock would be needed to hedge the investor\u2019s \nportfolio. If one writes 10 options and holds six shares of stock, according to the hedge ratio of .6, a $1 increase in stock price will result in a gain of $6 on the stock holdings, whereas the loss on the 10 options written will be 10\u00a0 3 \u00a0$.60, an equivalent $6. The stock price \nmovement leaves total wealth unaltered, which is what a hedged position is intended to do. \n Black-Scholes hedge ratios are particularly easy to compute. The hedge ratio for a call is \n N ( d  \n1 ), whereas the hedge ratio for a put is  N ( d  1 )\u00a0 2 \u00a01. We defined  N ( d  1 ) as part of the Black-\nScholes formula in Equation 21.1. Recall that  N ( d ) stands for the area under the standard \nnormal curve up to  d.  Therefore, the call option hedge ratio must be positive and less than \n1.0, whereas the put option hedge ratio is negative and of smaller absolute value than 1.0. \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   746bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   746 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 21 Option Valuation 747\n  Figure\u00a0 21.9  verifies that the slope of the \ncall option valuation function is less than \n1.0, approaching 1.0 only as the stock price \nbecomes much greater than the exercise price. \nThis tells us that option values change less \nthan one-for-one with changes in stock prices. \nWhy should this be? Suppose an option is so \nfar in the money that you are absolutely cer-\ntain it will be exercised. In that case, every \ndollar increase in the stock price would \nincrease the option value by $1. But if there is \na reasonable chance the call option will expire \nout of the money, even after a moderate stock \nprice gain, a $1 increase in the stock price will \nnot necessarily increase the ultimate payoff \nto the call; therefore, the call price will not \nrespond by a full dollar. \n The fact that hedge ratios are less than 1.0 \ndoes not contradict our earlier observation \nthat options offer leverage and disproportion-\nate sensitivity to stock price movements. Although  dollar   movements in option prices \nare less than dollar movements in the stock price, the  rate of return   volatility of options \nremains greater than stock return volatility because options sell at lower prices. In our \nexample, with the stock selling at $120, and a hedge ratio of .6, an option with exercise \nprice $120 may sell for $5. If the stock price increases to $121, the call price would be \nexpected to increase by only $.60 to $5.60. The percentage increase in the option value is \n$.60/$5.00\u00a0 5 \u00a012%, however, whereas the stock price increase is only $1/$120\u00a0 5 \u00a0.83%. The \nratio of the percentage changes is 12%/.83%\u00a0 5 \u00a014.4. For every 1% increase in the stock \nprice, the option price increases by 14.4%. This ratio, the percentage change in option \nprice per percentage change in stock price, is called the  option elasticity.   \n The hedge ratio is an essential tool in portfolio management and control. An example \nwill show why.     \nValue of a Call ( C)\nS0 40\n20\n0\n120Slope 5 .6\n Figure 21.9 Call option value and hedge ratio  \n Consider two portfolios, one holding 750 FinCorp calls and 200 shares of FinCorp and \nthe other holding 800 shares of FinCorp. Which portfolio has greater dollar exposure to \nFinCorp price movements? You can answer this question easily by using the hedge ratio. \n Each option changes in value by  H  dollars for each dollar change in stock price, \nwhere  H  stands for the hedge ratio. Thus, if  H  equals .6, the 750 options are equivalent \nto .6\u00a0 3 \u00a0750\u00a0 5 \u00a0450 shares in terms of the response of their market value to FinCorp \nstock price movements. The first portfolio has less dollar sensitivity to stock price change \nbecause the 450 share-equivalents of the options plus the 200 shares actually held are \nless than the 800 shares held in the second portfolio. \n This is not to say, however, that the first portfolio is less sensitive to the stock\u2019s rate of \nreturn. As we noted in discussing option elasticities, the first portfolio may have lower \ntotal value than the second, so despite its lower sensitivity in terms of total market \nvalue, it might have greater rate of return sensitivity. Because a call option has a lower \nmarket value than the stock, its price changes more than proportionally with stock price \nchanges, even though its hedge ratio is less than 1.0.

The protective put has proven to be extremely popular with investors. Even if the asset price falls, the put conveys the right to sell the asset for the exercise price, which is a way to lock in a minimum portfolio value. With an \nat-the-money put ( X \u00a0 5 \u00a0 S  \n0 ), the maximum loss that can be realized is the cost of the put. \nThe asset can be sold for  X,  which equals its original value, so even if the asset price \nfalls, the investor\u2019s net loss over the period is just the cost of the put. If the asset value increases, however, upside potential is unlimited.  Figure\u00a021.10  graphs the profit or loss on a protective put position as a function of the change in the value of the underlying asset,  P.     What is the elasticity of a put option currently \nselling for $4 with exercise price $120 and hedge ratio  2 .4 if the stock price is currently $122?

And if index puts are \nused to protect a non-indexed \nportfolio, tracking error can \nresult. For example, if the port-\nfolio falls in value while the \nmarket index rises, the put will \nfail to provide the intended pro-\ntection. Moreover, the maturi-\nties of traded options may not match the investor\u2019s horizon. Therefore, rather than using \noption strategies, investors may use trading strategies that mimic the payoff to a protective \nput option. \n Here is the general idea. Even if a put option on the desired portfolio does not exist, a \ntheoretical option-pricing model (such as the Black-Scholes model) can be used to deter-\nmine how that option\u2019s price would respond to the portfolio\u2019s value if it did trade. For \nexample, if stock prices were to fall, the put option would increase in value. The option \nmodel could quantify this relationship. The net exposure of the (hypothetical) protective \nput portfolio to swings in stock prices is the sum of the exposures of the two components \nof the portfolio, the stock and the put. The net exposure of the portfolio equals the equity \nexposure less the (offsetting) put option exposure. \n We can create \u201csynthetic\u201d protective put positions by holding a quantity of stocks with \nthe same net exposure to market swings as the hypothetical protective put position. The \nkey to this strategy is the option delta, or hedge ratio, that is, the change in the price of the \nprotective put option per change in the value of the underlying stock portfolio.  \nChange in Value\nof Protected Position\nChange in Value\nof Underlying Asset\n2P00\nCost of Put\n Figure 21.10 Profit on a protective put strategy  \n Suppose a portfolio is currently valued at $100 million. An at-the-money put option \non the portfolio might have a hedge ratio or delta of  2 .6, meaning the option\u2019s value \nswings $.60 for every dollar change in portfolio value, but in an opposite direction. Sup-\npose the stock portfolio falls in value by 2%. The profit on a hypothetical protective put \nposition (if the put existed) would be as follows (in millions of dollars): \nLoss on stocks: 2% of $100 5 $2.00\nGain on put: .6 3 $2.00 5 \u00a0 1.20\n Net loss    5 $  .80 Example 21.7 Synthetic Protective Put Options \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   749bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   749 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 5 0 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n The challenge with this procedure is that deltas constantly change.  Figure\u00a0 21.11  \nshows that as the stock price falls, the magnitude of the appropriate hedge ratio increases. \nTherefore, market declines require extra hedging, that is, additional conversion of equity \ninto cash. This constant updating of the hedge ratio is called    dynamic hedging    (alterna-\ntively, delta hedging).   \nDynamic hedging is one reason portfolio insurance has been said to contribute to mar-\nket volatility. Market declines trigger additional sales of stock as portfolio insurers strive to \nincrease their hedging. These additional sales \nare seen as reinforcing or exaggerating mar-\nket downturns. \n In practice, portfolio insurers often do \nnot actually buy or sell stocks directly when \nthey update their hedge positions. Instead, \nthey minimize trading costs by buying or \nselling stock index futures as a substitute \nfor sale of the stocks themselves. As you \nwill see in the next chapter, stock prices and \nindex futures prices usually are very tightly \nlinked by cross-market arbitrageurs so that \nfutures transactions can be used as reliable \nproxies for stock transactions. Instead of \nselling equities based on the put option\u2019s \ndelta, insurers will sell an equivalent number \nof futures contracts.  17     \n Several portfolio insurers suffered great set-\nbacks during the market crash of October 19, \n1987, when the market suffered an unprece-\ndented 1-day loss of about 20%. A description  We create the synthetic option position by selling a proportion of shares equal to the \nput option\u2019s delta (i.e., selling 60% of the shares) and placing the proceeds in risk-free \nT-bills. The rationale is that the hypothetical put option would have offset 60% of any \nchange in the stock portfolio\u2019s value, so one must reduce portfolio risk directly by sell-\ning 60% of the equity and putting the proceeds into a risk-free asset. Total return on a \nsynthetic protective put position with $60 million in risk-free investments such as T-bills \nand $40 million in equity is \n  Loss on stocks:  2% of $40\u00a0 5 \u00a0$.80 \n1  Loss on bills:   5 \u00a0   0\n   Net loss   5 \u00a0$.80 \n The synthetic and actual protective put positions have equal returns. We conclude \nthat if you sell a proportion of shares equal to the put option\u2019s delta and place the \nproceeds in cash equivalents, your exposure to the stock market will equal that of the \ndesired protective put position. \n0Value of a Put ( P)\nS0 Low Slope 5\nLow Hedge RatioHigher Slope 5\nHigh Hedge Ratio\n Figure 21.11 Hedge ratios change as the stock price \nfluctuates  \n17 Notice, however, that the use of index futures reintroduces the problem of tracking error between the portfolio \nand the market index. \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   750bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   750 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 21 Option Valuation 751\nof what happened then should let you appreciate the complexities of applying a seemingly \nstraightforward hedging concept. \n    1. Market volatility at the crash was much greater than ever encountered before. Put \noption deltas based on historical experience were too low; insurers underhedged, \nheld too much equity, and suffered excessive losses.  \n   2. Prices moved so fast that insurers could not keep up with the necessary rebalancing. \nThey were \u201cchasing deltas\u201d that kept getting away from them. The futures market \nalso saw a \u201cgap\u201d opening, where the opening price was nearly 10% below the previ-\nous day\u2019s close. The price dropped before insurers could update their hedge ratios.  \n   3. Execution problems were severe. First, current market prices were unavailable, with \ntrade execution and the price quotation system hours behind, which made computa-\ntion of correct hedge ratios impossible. Moreover, trading in stocks and stock futures \nceased during some periods. The continuous rebalancing capability that is essential \nfor a viable insurance program vanished during the precipitous market collapse.  \n   4. Futures prices traded at steep discounts to their proper levels compared to reported \nstock prices, thereby making the sale of futures (as a proxy for equity sales) seem \nexpensive. Although you will see in the next chapter that stock index futures prices \nnormally exceed the value of the stock index,  Figure\u00a021.12  shows that on October 19, \nfutures sold far below the stock index level. When some insurers gambled that the \nfutures price would recover to its usual premium over the stock index, and chose to \ndefer sales, they remained underhedged. As the market fell farther, their portfolios \nexperienced substantial losses.    \n Although most observers at the time believed that the portfolio insurance industry \nwould never recover from the market crash, delta hedging is still alive and well on Wall \nStreet. Dynamic hedges are widely used by large firms to hedge potential losses from \noptions positions. For example, the nearby box notes that when Microsoft ended its \nemployee stock option program and J. P.

The key to understanding his argument is to remember that when banks lend to or buy the debt of firms with limited liability, they implicitly write a put option to the borrower (see Chapter 20, Section 20.5). If the borrower has sufficient assets to pay off the loan when it comes due, it will do so, and the lender will be fully repaid. But if the borrower has insufficient assets, it can declare bankruptcy and discharge its obligations by transferring ownership of the firm to its creditors. The borrower\u2019s ability to satisfy the loan by transferring ownership is equivalent to the right to \u201csell\u201d itself to the creditor for the face value of the loan. This arrangement is therefore just like a put option on the firm with exercise price equal to the stipulated loan repayment.\n   \n Consider the payoff to the lender at loan maturity (time  T ) as a function of the value of \nthe borrowing firm,  V   T  , when the loan, with face value  L,  comes due. If  V   T  \u00a0 $ \u00a0 L,  the lender \nis paid off in full. But if  V   T  \u00a0,\u00a0 L,  the lender gets the firm, which is worth less than the \npromised payment  L.  \n We can write the payoff in a way that emphasizes the implicit put option: \n   Payoff5bL\nVT5L2b0L2V\nT\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if VT$L\nif VT,L  (21.4)  \nEquation 21.4 shows that the payoff on the loan equals  L  (when the firm has sufficient \nassets to pay off the debt),  minus  the payoff of a put option on the value of the firm ( V   T  ) \nwith an exercise price of  L.  Therefore, we may view risky lending as a combination of safe \nlending, with a guaranteed payoff of  L,  combined with a short position in a put option on \nthe borrower. \n  18 This material is based on a lecture given by Robert Merton at MIT in March 2009. You can find the lecture \nonline at   http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/659   .    J. P . Morgan Rolls Dice on Microsoft Options \n Microsoft, in a shift that could be copied throughout the \ntechnology business, said yesterday that it plans to stop issuing stock options to its employees, and instead will pro-vide them with restricted stock. \n Though details of the plan still aren\u2019t clear, J. P. Morgan \neffectively plans to buy the options from Microsoft employ-\nees who opt for restricted stock instead. Employee stock options are granted as a form of compensation and allow employees the right to exchange the options for shares of company stock. \n The price offered to employees for the options pre-\nsumably will be lower than the current value, giving \nJ. P.  Morgan a chance to make a profit on the deal. Rather than holding the options, and thus betting Microsoft\u2019s stock will rise, people familiar with the bank\u2019s strategy say J. P. Morgan probably will match each option it buys from the company\u2019s employees with a separate trade in the stock market that both hedges the bet and gives itself a margin of profit. \n For Wall Street\u2019s so-called rocket scientists who do compli-\ncated financial transactions such as this one, the strategy behind \nJ. P. Morgan\u2019s deal with Microsoft isn\u2019t particularly unique or sophisticated. They add that the bank has several ways to deal with the millions of Microsoft options that could come its way. \n The bank, for instance, could hedge the options by short-\ning, or betting against, Microsoft stock. Microsoft has the \nlargest market capitalization of any stock in the market, and its shares are among the most liquid, meaning it would be easy to hedge the risk of holding those options. J. P. Morgan also could sell the options to investors, much as they would do with a syndicated loan, thereby spreading the risk.  \n  Source:  Jathon Sapsford and Ken Brown,  The Wall Street Journal,  \nJuly 9, 2003.

Here, \nthe CDS seller agrees to make up any \nlosses due to the insolvency of a bond \nissuer. If the issuer goes bankrupt, leav-\ning assets of only  V   T   for the creditors, the \nCDS seller is obligated to make up the \ndifference,  L \u00a0 2 \u00a0 V   T  . This is in essence a \npure put option. \n Now think about the exposure of these \nimplicit put writers to changes in the \nfinancial health of the underlying firm. \nThe value of a put option on  V   T   appears \nin  Figure\u00a021.13 . When the firm is finan-\ncially strong (i.e.,  V  is far greater than  L ), \nthe slope of the curve is nearly zero, \nimplying that there is little exposure of the \nimplicit put writer (either the bank or the \nCDS writer) to the value of the borrowing firm. For example, when firm value is 1.75 times \nthe value of the debt, the dashed line drawn tangent to the put value curve has a slope of only \n 2 .040. But if there is a big shock to the economy, and firm value falls, not only does the \nvalue of the implicit put rise, but its slope is now steeper, implying that exposure to further \nshocks is now far greater. When firm value is only 75% of the value of the loan, the slope of \nthe line tangent to the put value valuation curve is far steeper,  2 .644. You can see how as you \nget closer to the edge of the cliff, it gets easier and easier to slide right off.   \nWe often hear people say that a shock to asset values of the magnitude of the financial \ncrisis was a 10-sigma event, by which they mean that such an event was so extreme that \nit would be 10 standard deviations away from an expected outcome, making it virtually \ninconceivable. But this analysis shows that standard deviation may be a moving target, \nincreasing dramatically as the firm weakens. As the economy falters and put options go \nfurther into the money, their sensitivity to further shocks increases, increasing the risk \nthat even worse losses may be around the corner. The built-in instability of risk exposures \nmakes a scenario like the crisis more plausible and should give us pause when we discount \nan extreme scenario as \u201calmost impossible.\u201d  \n  Option Pricing and Portfolio Theory \n We\u2019ve just seen that the option pricing model predicts that security risk characteristics can \nbe unstable. For example, as the firm weakens, the risk of its debt can quickly accelerate. \nSo, too, can equity risk change dramatically as the firm\u2019s financial condition deteriorates. \nWe know from the last chapter (Section 20.5) that equity in a levered firm is like a call \noption on the value of the firm. If firm value exceeds the value of the firm\u2019s maturing debt, \nthe firm can choose to pay off the debt, retaining the difference between firm value and the \nface value of its debt. If not, the firm can default on the loan, turning the firm over to its \ncreditors, and the equity holders get nothing. In this sense, equity is a call option, and the \nfirm\u2019s total value is the underlying asset. \n In Section 21.5, we saw that the  elasticity   of an option measures the sensitivity of its rate \nof return to the rate of return on the underlying asset. For example, if a call option\u2019s elasticity \nis five, its rate of return will swing five times as widely as the rate of return on the underlying \nasset. This would imply that both the option\u2019s beta and its standard deviation are five times the \n21001020304050\n50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250\nFirm Value as Percent of Face Value of DebtValue of Put as % of Face\n Value of Debt\n Figure 21.13  Value of implicit put option on a loan guarantee as \na percentage of the face value of debt  (Debt maturity\u00a0 5 \u00a01\u00a0year; \nStandard deviation of value of firm\u00a0 5 \u00a040%; Risk free rate\u00a0 5 \u00a06%)  \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   753bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   753 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 5 4 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nbeta and standard deviation of \nthe underlying asset. \n Therefore, when compil-\ning the \u201cinput list\u201d for creating \nan efficient portfolio, we may \nwish to think of equity as an \nimplicit call option and com-\npute its elasticity with respect \nto the total value of the firm. \nFor example, if the covariance \nof the firm\u2019s  assets   with other \nsecurities is stable, then we \ncan use elasticity to find the \ncovariance of the firm\u2019s  equity\nwith those securities. This will \nallow us to calculate beta and \nstandard deviation. \n Unfortunately, elasticity can \nitself be a moving target. As \nthe firm gets weaker, its elas-\nticity will increase, potentially \nvery quickly.  Figure\u00a021.14  uses \nthe Black-Scholes model to plot call option elasticity as a function of the value of the \nunderlying stock. Notice that as the option goes out of the money (the stock price falls \nbelow 100), elasticity increases rapidly and without limit. Similarly, as the firm gets closer \nto insolvency (the value of firm assets falls below the face value of debt), equity elasticity \nshoots up, and even small changes in financial condition can lead to major changes in risk. \nElasticity is far more stable (and closer to 1) when the firm is healthy, i.e., the implicit call \noption is deep in the money. Similarly, equity risk characteristics will be far more stable for \nhealthy firms than for precarious ones.     \nHedging Bets on Mispriced Options \n Suppose you believe that the standard deviation of IBM stock returns will be 35% over the \nnext few weeks, but IBM put options are selling at a price consistent with a volatility of \n33%. Because the put\u2019s implied volatility is less than your forecast of the stock volatility, \nyou believe the option is underpriced. Using your assessment of volatility in an option-\npricing model like the Black-Scholes formula, you would estimate that the fair price for \nthe puts exceeds the actual price. \n Does this mean that you ought to buy put options? Perhaps it does, but by doing so, \nyou risk losses if IBM stock performs well,  even if   you are correct about the volatility. You \nwould like to separate your bet on volatility from the \u201cattached\u201d bet inherent in purchasing \na put that IBM\u2019s stock price will fall. In other words, you would like to speculate on the \noption mispricing by purchasing the put option, but hedge the resulting exposure to the \nperformance of IBM stock. \n The option  delta   can be interpreted as a hedge ratio that can be used for this purpose. \nThe delta was defined as   \n   Delta5Change in value of option\nChan ge in value of stock  (21.5)  \nTherefore, delta is the slope of the option-pricing curve. \n35\n2530\n20\n15Elasticity\n5\n0\n25 50 75 100 125\nStock Price175 150 20010\n Figure 21.14  Call option elasticity as a function of stock price  \n(Parameters:\u00a0 s \u00a0 5 \u00a0.25;\u00a0 T \u00a0 5 \u00a0.5,\u00a0 r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.06;\u00a0 X \u00a0 5 \u00a0100)  \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   754bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   754 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 21 Option Valuation 755\n This ratio tells us precisely how many shares of stock we must hold to offset our \nexposure to IBM. For example, if the delta is  2 .6, then the put will fall by $.60 in value \nfor every one-point increase in IBM stock, and we need to hold .6 share of stock to hedge \neach put. If we purchase 10 option contracts, each for 100 shares, we would need to buy 600 shares of stock. If the stock price rises by $1, each put option will decrease in value by $.60, resulting in a loss of $600. However, the loss on the puts will be offset by a gain on the stock holdings of $1 per share\u00a0 3 \u00a0600\u00a0shares. \n To see how the profits on this strategy might develop, let\u2019s use the following example.   \n \n Suppose option expiration  T  is 60 days; put price  P  is $4.495; exercise price  X  is $90; \nstock price  S  is $90; and the risk-free rate  r  is 4%. We assume that the stock will not pay \na dividend in the next 60 days. Given these data, the implied volatility on the option is \n33%, as we posited. However, you believe the true volatility is 35%, implying that the fair put price is $4.785. Therefore, if the market assessment of volatility is revised to the value you believe is correct, your profit will be $.29 per put purchased. \n Recall that the hedge ratio, or delta, of a put option equals  N ( d  \n1 )\u00a0 2 \u00a01, where  N  (\u2022) is \nthe cumulative normal distribution function and \n  ln(S/X) 1 ( r 1 s2/2 )T\ns\u221aTd1 5\n Using your estimate of  s \u00a0 5 \u00a0.35, you find that the hedge ratio  N ( d  1 )\u00a0 2 \u00a01\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 .453. \n Suppose, therefore, that you purchase 10 option contracts (1,000 puts) and purchase \n453 shares of stock. Once the market \u201ccatches up\u201d to your presumably better volatil-\nity estimate, the put options purchased will increase in value. If the market assessment of volatility changes as soon as you purchase the options, your profits should equal 1,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0$.29\u00a0 5 \u00a0$290. The option price will be affected as well by any change in the \nstock price, but this part of your exposure will be eliminated if the hedge ratio is chosen properly. Your profit should be based solely on the effect of the change in the implied volatility of the put, with the impact of the stock price hedged away. \n  Table\u00a021.3  illustrates your profits as a function of the stock price assuming that the \nput price changes to reflect  your  estimate of volatility. Panel B shows that the put option \nalone can provide profits or losses depending on whether the stock price falls or rises. We see in panel C, however, that each  hedged  put option provides profits nearly equal \nto the original mispricing, regardless of the change in the stock price.  Example 21.8 Speculating on Mispriced Options \n Notice in Example 21.8 that the profit is not exactly independent of the stock price. This \nis because as the stock price changes, so do the deltas used to calculate the hedge ratio. The \nhedge ratio in principle would need to be continually adjusted as deltas evolve. The sensi-tivity of the delta to the stock price is called the    gamma    of the option. Option gammas are \nanalogous to bond convexity. In both cases, the curvature of the value function means that hedge ratios or durations change with market conditions, making rebalancing a necessary part of hedging strategies.  Suppose you bet on volatility by purchasing calls instead of puts. How would you \nhedge your exposure to stock-price fluctuations? What is the hedge ratio?  CONCEPT CHECK 21.9 \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   755bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   755 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 5 6 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n A variant of the strategy in Example 21.8 involves cross-option speculation. Suppose \nyou observe a 45-day expiration call option on IBM with strike price 95 selling at a price \nconsistent with a volatility of  s5 \u00a033% while another 45-day call with strike price 90 has \nan implied volatility of only 27%. Because the underlying asset and expiration date are \nidentical, you conclude that the call with the higher implied volatility is relatively over-\npriced. To exploit the mispricing, you might buy the cheap calls (with strike price 90 and \nimplied volatility of 27%) and write the expensive calls (with strike price 95 and implied \nvolatility 33%). If the risk-free rate is 4% and IBM is selling at $90 per share, the calls \npurchased will be priced at $3.6202 and the calls written will be priced at $2.3735. \n Despite the fact that you are long one call and short another, your exposure to IBM \nstock-price uncertainty will not be hedged using this strategy. This is because calls with \ndifferent strike prices have different sensitivities to the price of the underlying asset. The \nlower-strike-price call has a higher delta and therefore greater exposure to the price of \nIBM. If you take an equal number of positions in these two options, you will inadvertently \nestablish a bullish position in IBM, as the calls you purchase have higher deltas than the \ncalls you write. In fact, you may recall from Chapter 20 that this portfolio (long call with \nlow exercise price and short call with high exercise price) is called a  bullish spread.\n To establish a hedged position, we can use the hedge ratio approach as follows. \nConsider the 95-strike-price options you write as the asset that hedges your exposure to the \n90-strike-price options you purchase. Then the hedge ratio is\n H5Change in value of 90-strike-price call for $1 change in IBM\nChan ge in value of 95-strike-price call for $1 chan ge in IBM\n 5Delta of 90-strike-price call\nDelta of 95-strike-price call.1\nYou need to write  more   than one call with the higher strike price to hedge the purchase of \neach call with the lower strike price. Because the prices of higher-strike-price calls are less \nsensitive to IBM prices, more of them are required to offset the exposure. \n Table 21.3 \n Profit on hedged \nput portfolio A.

We know that the delta of a call option is  N ( d  1 ). Therefore, the deltas \nof the two options and the hedge ratio are computed as follows:\n    Option with strike price 90:  \n    d15ln(90/90 )1(.041.302/2)345/365\n.30\"45/3655.0995\n  N(d1)5.5396        \nOption with strike price 95:   \n   d15ln(90/95 )1(.041.302/2)345/365\n.30\"45/36552 .4138\n  N(d1)5.3395        \nHedge ratio:   \n  .5396\n.339551.589     \nTherefore, for every 1,000 call options purchased with strike price 90, we need to write \n1,589 call options with strike price 95. Following this strategy enables us to bet on the rela-\ntive mispricing of the two options without taking a position on IBM. Panel A of  Table\u00a021.4  \nshows that the position will result in a cash inflow of $151.30. The premium income on the \ncalls written exceeds the cost of the calls purchased. \n When you establish a position in stocks and options that is hedged with respect to fluc-\ntuations in the price of the underlying asset, your portfolio is said to be    delta neutral    ,  \nmeaning that the portfolio has no tendency to either increase or decrease in value when the \nstock price fluctuates. \n Let\u2019s check that our options position is in fact delta neutral.

You expect to \nprofit from the increase in the value of the call purchased as well as from the decrease in the value of the call written. The option prices at 30% volatility are given in panel B of  Table\u00a021.4  and the values of your position for various stock prices are presented in panel C. Although the profit or loss on each option is affected by the stock price, the value of the delta-neutral option portfolio is positive and essentially independent of the price of IBM. Moreover, we saw in panel A that the portfolio would have been established without ever requiring a cash outlay. You would have cash inflows both when you establish the portfolio  and  when you liquidate it after the implied volatilities \nconverge to 30%. \n This unusual profit opportunity arises because you have identified prices out of align-\nment. Such opportunities could not arise if prices were at equilibrium levels. By exploiting the pricing discrepancy using a delta-neutral strategy, you should earn profits regardless of the price movement in IBM stock. \n Delta-neutral hedging strategies are also subject to practical problems, the most impor-\ntant of which is the difficulty in assessing the proper volatility for the coming period. If the volatility estimate is incorrect, so will be the deltas, and the overall position will not truly be hedged. Moreover, option or option-plus-stock positions generally will not be neutral with respect to changes in volatility. For example, a put option hedged by a stock might be delta neutral, but it is not volatility neutral. Changes in the market assessments of volatility will affect the option price even if the stock price is unchanged. \n These problems can be serious, because volatility estimates are never fully reliable. \nFirst, volatility cannot be observed directly and must be estimated from past data which imparts measurement error to the forecast. Second, we\u2019ve seen that both historical and implied volatilities fluctuate over time. Therefore, we are always shooting at a moving target. Although delta-neutral positions are hedged against changes in the price of the underlying asset, they still are subject to  volatility risk,  the risk incurred from unpre-\ndictable changes in volatility. The sensitivity of an option price to changes in volatility is called the option\u2019s    vega    .   Thus, although delta-neutral option hedges might eliminate \nexposure to risk from fluctuations in the value of the underlying asset, they do not elimi-nate volatility risk.   \n   21.6 Empirical Evidence on Option Pricing \n  The Black-Scholes option-pricing model has been subject to an enormous number of empirical tests. For the most part, the results of the studies have been positive in that the Black-Scholes model generates option values fairly close to the actual prices at which options trade. At the same time, some regular empirical failures of the model have been noted. \n The biggest problem concerns volatility. If the model were accurate, the implied volatil-\nity of all options on a particular stock with the same expiration date would be equal\u2014after all, the underlying asset and expiration date are the same for each option, so the volatility inferred from each also ought to be the same. But in fact, when one actually plots implied volatility as a function of exercise price, the typical results appear as in  Figure\u00a021.15 , which treats S&P 500 index options as the underlying asset. Implied volatility steadily falls as the exercise price rises. Clearly, the Black-Scholes model is missing something.  \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   758bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   758 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 21 Option Valuation 759\n Rubinstein  19   suggests that the prob-\nlem with the model has to do with fears of \na market crash like that of October 1987. \nThe idea is that deep out-of-the-money puts \nwould be nearly worthless if stock prices \nevolve smoothly, because the probabil-\nity of the stock falling by a large amount \n(and the put option thereby moving into \nthe money) in a short time would be very \nsmall. But a possibility of a sudden large \ndownward jump that could move the puts \ninto the money, as in a market crash, would \nimpart greater value to these options. Thus, \nthe market might price these options as \nthough there is a bigger chance of a large \ndrop in the stock price than would be sug-\ngested by the Black-Scholes assumptions. \nThe result of the higher option price is a \ngreater implied volatility derived from the \nBlack-Scholes model.  \n Interestingly, Rubinstein points out \nthat prior to the 1987 market crash, plots \nof implied volatility like the one in  Figure\u00a021.15  were relatively flat, consistent with the \nnotion that the market was then less attuned to fears of a crash. However, postcrash plots \nhave been consistently downward sloping, exhibiting a shape often called the  option smirk.\nWhen we use option-pricing models that allow for more general stock price distributions, \nincluding crash risk and random changes in volatility, they generate downward-sloping \nimplied volatility curves similar to the one observed in  Figure\u00a021.15 .  20        \n0.84 0.89 0.94 0.99 1.04 1.09Implied Volatility (%)\nRatio of Exercise Price to Current Value of Index25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n Figure 21.15 Implied volatility of the S&P 500 index as a \nfunction of exercise price \n  Source: Mark Rubinstein, \u201cImplied Binomial Trees,\u201d  Journal of Finance   (July \n1994), pp. 771\u2013818. \n     1 .   Option values may be viewed as the sum of intrinsic value plus time or \u201cvolatility\u201d value. The \nvolatility value is the right to choose not to exercise if the stock price moves against the holder. \nThus the option holder cannot lose more than the cost of the option regardless of stock price \nperformance.  \n    2 .   Call options are more valuable when the exercise price is lower, when the stock price is higher, \nwhen the interest rate is higher, when the time to expiration is greater, when the stock\u2019s volatility \nis greater, and when dividends are lower.  \n    3 .   Call options must sell for at least the stock price less the present value of the exercise price and \ndividends to be paid before expiration. This implies that a call option on a non-dividend-paying \nstock may be sold for more than the proceeds from immediate exercise. Thus European calls are \nworth as much as American calls on stocks that pay no dividends, because the right to exercise the \nAmerican call early has no value.

Options may be priced relative to the underlying stock price using a simple two-period, two-\nstate pricing model. As the number of periods increases, the binomial model can approximate more realistic stock price distributions. The Black-Scholes formula may be seen as a limiting case of the binomial option model, as the holding period is divided into progressively smaller subperiods when the interest rate and stock volatility are constant.  \n    5.  The Black-Scholes formula applies to options on stocks that pay no dividends. Dividend adjustments may be adequate to price European calls on dividend-paying stocks, but the proper treatment of American calls on dividend-paying stocks requires more complex formulas.  \n    6.  Put options may be exercised early, whether the stock pays dividends or not. Therefore,  American puts generally are worth more than European puts.  \n    7.  European put values can be derived from the call value and the put-call parity relationship. This technique cannot be applied to American puts for which early exercise is a possibility.  \n    8.  The implied volatility of an option is the standard deviation of stock returns consistent with an option\u2019s market price. It can be backed out of an option-pricing model by finding the stock volatility that makes the option\u2019s value equal to its observed price.  \n    9.  The hedge ratio is the number of shares of stock required to hedge the price risk involved in writing one option. Hedge ratios are near zero for deep out-of-the-money call options and approach 1.0 for deep in-the-money calls.  \n    10.  Although their hedge ratios are less than 1.0, call options have elasticities greater than 1.0. The rate of return on a call (as opposed to the dollar return) responds more than one-for-one with stock price movements.  \n    11.  Portfolio insurance can be obtained by purchasing a protective put option on an equity position. When the appropriate put is not traded, portfolio insurance entails a dynamic hedge strategy where a fraction of the equity portfolio equal to the desired put option\u2019s delta is sold and placed in risk-free securities.  \n    12.  The option delta is used to determine the hedge ratio for options positions. Delta-neutral portfo-lios are independent of price changes in the underlying asset. Even delta-neutral option portfo-lios are subject to volatility risk, however.  \n    13.  Empirically, implied volatilities derived from the Black-Scholes formula tend to be lower on options with higher exercise prices. This may be evidence that the option prices reflect the pos-sibility of a sudden dramatic decline in stock prices. Such \u201ccrashes\u201d are inconsistent with the Black-Scholes assumptions.

What would be the hedge ratio for the following exercise prices: 120, 110, 100, 90? What do you conclude about the hedge ratio as the option becomes progressively more in the money?  \n   8.

The Value of a Put Option\nS Decreases\nX Increases\ns Increases\nT Increases*\nrf Decreases\nDividend payouts Increases\n*For American puts, increase in time to expiration must increase value. One can always choose to exercise early if \nthis is optimal; the longer expiration date simply expands the range of alternatives open to the option holder which must make the option more valuable. For a European put, where early exercise is not allowed, longer time to expiration can have an indeterminate effect. Longer expiration increases volatility value because the final stock price is more uncertain, but it reduces the present value of the exercise price that will be received if the put is exercised. The net effect on put value can be positive or negative.\n   To understand the impact of higher volatility, consider the same scenarios as for the call. The low-\nvolatility scenario yields a lower expected payoff.  \n High  Stock price  $10  $20  $30  $40  $50 \n volatility  Put payoff  $20  $10  $  0  $  0  $  0 \n Low  Stock price  $20  $25  $30  $35  $40 \n volatility  Put payoff  $10  $  5  $  0  $  0  $  0 \n   2. The parity relationship assumes that all options are held until expiration and that there are no cash \nflows until expiration. These assumptions are valid only in the special case of European options \non non-dividend-paying stocks. If the stock pays no dividends, the American and European calls are equally valuable, whereas the American put is worth more than the European put. Therefore, although the parity theorem for European options states that \n  P5C2S\n01PV(X) \n  in fact,  P  will be  greater  than this value if the put is American.    \nbod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   768bod61671_ch21_722-769.indd   768 7/27/13   1:45 AM7/27/13   1:45 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 21 Option Valuation 769\n 3.

The key difference is that the holder of an option is not compelled to buy or sell, and will not do so if the trade is unprofitable. A futures or forward contract, however, car-ries the obligation to go through with the agreed-upon transaction. \n A forward contract is not an investment \nin the strict sense that funds are paid for an \nasset. It is only a commitment today to transact in the future. Forward arrangements are part of our study of investments, however, because they offer powerful means to hedge other investments and generally modify portfolio characteristics. \n Forward markets for future delivery of \nvarious commodities go back at least to \nancient Greece. Organized  futures markets,\nthough, are a relatively modern develop-ment, dating only to the 19th century. Futures markets replace informal forward contracts with highly standardized, exchange-traded securities. \n While futures markets have their roots in \nagricultural products and commodities, the \nmarkets today are dominated by trading in financial futures such as those on stock indexes, interest-rate-dependent securities such as gov-ernment bonds, and foreign exchange. The markets themselves also have changed, with trading today largely taking place in electronic markets. \n This chapter describes the workings of \nfutures markets and the mechanics of trading \nin these markets. We show how futures con-tracts are useful investment vehicles for both hedgers and speculators and how the futures price relates to the spot price of an asset. We also show how futures can be used in several risk-management applications. This chapter deals with general principles of future mar-kets. Chapter 23 describes specific futures markets in greater detail.

The entire planting season\u2019s revenue depends critically on the highly volatile crop price. The farmer can\u2019t easily diversify his position because virtually his entire wealth is tied up in the crop. \n The miller who must purchase wheat for processing faces a risk management problem \nthat is the mirror image of the farmer\u2019s. He is subject to profit uncertainty because of the unpredictable cost of the wheat. \n Both parties can hedge their risk by entering into a  forward contract  requiring the \nfarmer to deliver the wheat when harvested at a price agreed upon now, regardless of the market price at harvest time. No money need change hands at this time. A forward contract is simply a deferred-delivery sale of some asset with the sales price agreed on now. All that is required is that each party be willing to lock in the ultimate delivery price. The contract protects each party from future price fluctuations. \n Futures markets formalize and standardize forward contracting. Buyers and sellers \ntrade in a centralized futures exchange. The exchange standardizes the types of con-tracts that may be traded: It establishes contract size, the acceptable grade of commodity, contract delivery dates, and so forth. Although standardization eliminates much of the flexibility available in forward contracting, it has the offsetting advantage of liquidity because many traders will concentrate on the same small set of contracts. Futures con-tracts also differ from forward contracts in that they call for a daily settling up of any gains or losses on the contract. By contrast, no money changes hands in forward contracts until the delivery date. \n The centralized market, standardization of contracts, and depth of trading in each con-\ntract allows futures positions to be liquidated easily rather than renegotiated with the other party to the contract. Because the exchange guarantees the performance of each party, costly credit checks on other traders are not necessary. Instead, each trader simply posts a good-faith deposit, called the  margin,  to guarantee contract performance.  \n   The Basics of Futures Contracts \n The futures contract calls for delivery of a commodity at a specified delivery or maturity date, for an agreed-upon price, called the  futures price,  to be paid at contract maturity. The \ncontract specifies precise requirements for the commodity. For agricultural commodities, the exchange sets allowable grades (e.g., No. 2 hard winter wheat or No. 1 soft red wheat). The place or means of delivery of the commodity is specified as well. Delivery of agri-cultural commodities is made by transfer of warehouse receipts issued by approved ware-houses. For financial futures, delivery may be made by wire transfer; for index futures, delivery may be accomplished by a cash settlement procedure such as those for index options. Although the futures contract technically calls for delivery of an asset, delivery rarely occurs. Instead, parties to the contract much more commonly close out their posi-tions before contract maturity, taking gains or losses in cash. \n Because the futures exchange specifies all the terms of the contract, the traders need \nbargain only over the futures price. The trader taking the  long position  commits to pur-\nchasing the commodity on the delivery date. The trader who takes the  short position  com-\nmits to delivering the commodity at contract maturity. The trader in the long position is said to \u201cbuy\u201d a contract; the short-side trader \u201csells\u201d a contract. The words  buy  and  sell      22.1 The Futures Contract \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   771bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   771 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n772 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nare figurative only, because a contract is not really bought or sold like a stock or bond; it \nis entered into by mutual agreement. At the time the contract is entered into, no money changes hands. \n  Figure\u00a022.1  shows prices for several futures contracts as they appear in  The Wall Street \nJournal.  The boldface heading lists in each case the commodity, the exchange where the futures contract is traded, the contract size, and the pricing unit. The first agricultural con-tract listed is for corn, traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT). (The CBT merged with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2007 but, for now, maintains a separate identity.) Each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, and prices in the entry are quoted in cents per bushel.  \n The next several rows detail price data for contracts expiring on various dates. The \nMarch 2013 maturity corn contract, for example, opened during the day at a futures price of 720.25 cents per bushel. The highest futures price during the day was 726, the lowest was 714.50, and the settlement price (a representative trading price during the last few minutes of trading) was 724.25. The settlement price increased by 3.50 cents from the previous trading day. Finally, open interest, or the number of outstanding contracts, was 494,588. Similar information is given for each maturity date. \n The trader holding the long position, that is, the person who will purchase the good, \nprofits from price increases. Suppose that when the contract matures in March, the price of corn turns out to be 729.25 cents per bushel. The long-position trader who entered the contract at the futures price of 724.25 cents therefore earns a profit of 5 cents per bushel. As each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, the profit to the long position equals 5,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0$.05\u00a0 5 \u00a0$250 per contract. Conversely, the short position loses 5 cents per bushel. \nThe short position\u2019s loss equals the long position\u2019s gain. \n To summarize, at maturity: \nProfit to long 5 Spot price at maturity 2 Original futures price\nProfit to short 5 Original futures price 2 Spot price at maturity  \n where the spot price is the actual market price of the commodity at the time of the delivery. \n The futures contract, therefore, is a  zero-sum game,  with losses and gains netting out to \nzero. Every long position is offset by a short position. The aggregate profits to futures trad-ing, summing over all investors, also must be zero, as is the net exposure to changes in the commodity price. For this reason, the establishment of a futures market in a commodity should not have a major impact on prices in the spot market for that commodity. \n  Figure\u00a022.2 , panel A is a plot of the profits realized by an investor who enters the long \nside of a futures contract as a function of the price of the asset on the maturity date. Notice that profit is zero when the ultimate spot price,  P  \n T  , equals the initial futures price,  F  0 . \nProfit per unit of the underlying asset rises or falls one-for-one with changes in the final \nspot price. Unlike the payoff of a call option, the payoff of the long futures position can be negative: This will be the case if the spot price falls below the original futures price. Unlike the holder of a call, who has an  option  to buy, the long futures position trader can-\nnot simply walk away from the contract. Also unlike options, in the case of futures there is no need to distinguish gross payoffs from net profits. This is because the futures contract is not purchased; it is simply a contract that is agreed to by two parties. The futures price adjusts to make the present value of entering into a new contract equal to zero.  \n The distinction between futures and options is highlighted by comparing panel A of \n Figure\u00a022.2  to the payoff and profit diagrams for an investor in a call option with exercise price,  X,  chosen equal to the futures price  F  \n0  (see panel C). The futures investor is exposed \nto considerable losses if the asset price falls. In contrast, the investor in the call cannot lose more than the cost of the option. \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   772bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   772 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n773Copper-High (CMX) -25,000 Ibs.;

CONCEPT CHECK 22.1 \n  Existing Contracts \n Futures and forward contracts are traded on a wide variety of goods in four broad catego-\nries: agricultural commodities, metals and minerals (including energy commodities), for-\neign currencies, and financial futures (fixed-income securities and stock market indexes). \nIn addition to indexes on broad stock indexes, one can now trade  single-stock futures   on \nindividual stocks and narrowly based indexes. OneChicago has operated an entirely elec-\ntronic market in single-stock futures since 2002. The exchange maintains futures markets \nin actively traded stocks with the most liquidity as well as in some popular ETFs such as \nthose on the S&P 500 (ticker SPY), the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ), and the Dow Jones Indus-\ntrial Average (DIA). However, trading volume in single-stock futures has to date been \nsomewhat disappointing. \n  Table\u00a022.1  offers a sample of the various contracts trading in 2013. Contracts now trade \non items that would not have been considered possible only a few years ago, such as elec-\ntricity as well as weather futures and options contracts. Weather derivatives (which trade \non the Chicago Mercantile Exchange) have payoffs that depend on average weather con-\nditions, for example, the number of degree-days by which the temperature in a region \nexceeds or falls short of 65 degrees Fahrenheit. The potential use of these derivatives in \nmanaging the risk surrounding electricity or oil and natural gas use should be evident.  \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   774bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   774 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 22 Futures Markets 775\n  While  Table\u00a022.1  includes many contracts, the large and ever-growing array of markets \nmakes this list necessarily incomplete. The nearby box discusses some comparatively fan-\nciful futures markets, sometimes called  prediction markets,   in which payoffs may be tied \nto the winner of presidential elections, the box office receipts of a particular movie, or \nanything else in which participants are willing to take positions. \n Outside the futures markets, a well-developed network of banks and brokers has estab-\nlished a forward market in foreign exchange. This forward market is not a formal exchange \nin the sense that the exchange specifies the terms of the traded contract. Instead, partici-\npants in a forward contract may negotiate for delivery of any quantity of goods, whereas \nin the formal futures markets contract size and delivery dates are set by the exchange. In \nforward arrangements, banks and brokers simply negotiate contracts for clients (or them-\nselves) as needed. This market is huge. In London alone, the largest currency market, \naround $2 trillion of currency trades each day.    \nForeign \nCurrencies AgriculturalMetals and \nEnergy Interest Rate Futures Equity Indexes\nBritish pound Corn Copper Eurodollars S&P 500 index\nCanadian dollar Oats Aluminum Euroyen Dow Jones Industrials\nJapanese yen Soybeans Gold Euro-denominated bond S&P Midcap 400\nEuro Soybean meal Platinum Euroswiss NASDAQ 100\nSwiss franc Soybean oil Palladium Sterling NYSE index\nAustralian dollar Wheat Silver British government bond Russell 2000 index\nMexican peso Barley Crude oil German government bond Nikkei 225 (Japanese)\nBrazilian real Flaxseed Heating oil Italian government bond FTSE index (British)\nCanola Gas oil Canadian government bond CAC-40 (French)\nRye Natural gas Treasury bonds DAX-30 (German)\nCattle Gasoline Treasury notes All ordinary (Australian)\nHogs Propane Treasury bills Toronto 35 (Canadian)\nPork bellies Commodity index LIBOR Dow Jones Euro STOXX 50\nCocoa Electricity EURIBOR Industry indexes, e.g.,\nCoffee Weather Municipal bond index   Banking\nCotton Federal funds rate   Telecom\nMilk Bankers\u2019 acceptance   Utilities\nOrange juice Interest rate swaps   Health care\nSugar   Technology\nLumber\nRice\n Table 22.1 \n Sample of futures contracts \n   The Clearinghouse and Open Interest \n Until about 10 years ago, most futures trades in the United States occurred among floor \ntraders in the \u201ctrading pit\u201d for each contract. Today, however, trading is overwhelmingly \nconducted through electronic networks, particularly for financial futures.     22.2 Trading Mechanics \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   775bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   775 7/30/13   9:29 PM7/30/13   9:29 PMFinal PDF to printer\n Prediction Markets \n If you find S&P 500 or T-bond contracts a bit dry, perhaps \nyou\u2019d be interested in futures contracts with payoffs that depend on the winner of the next presidential election, or the severity of the next influenza season, or the host city of the 2024 Olympics. You can now find \u201cfutures markets\u201d in these events and many others. \n For example, both Intrade (  www.intrade.com  ) and Iowa \nElectronic Markets (  www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem  ) maintain \npresidential futures markets.   In July 2011, you could have \npurchased a contract that would pay off $1 in November 2012 \nif the Republican candidate won the presidential race but nothing if he lost. The contract price (expressed as a percent-age of face value) therefore may be viewed as the probability of a Republican victory, at least according to the consensus view of market participants at the time. If you believed in July that the probability of a Republican victory was 55%, you would have been prepared to pay up to $.55 for the contract. Alternatively, if you had wished to bet against the Republi-cans, you could have  sold  the contract. Similarly, you could bet on (or against) a Democrat victory using the Democrat contract. (When there are only two relevant parties, betting on one is equivalent to betting against the other, but in other elections, such as primaries where there are several viable candidates, selling one candidate\u2019s contract is not the same as buying another\u2019s.) \n The accompanying figure shows the price of each con-\ntract from July 2011 through Election Day 2012. The price \nclearly tracks each candidate\u2019s perceived prospects. You can see Obama\u2019s price rise dramatically in the days shortly before the election as it became ever clearer that he would win the election. \n Interpreting prediction market prices as probabilities \nactually requires a caveat. Because the contract payoff is \nrisky, the price of the contract may reflect a risk premium. Therefore, to be precise, these probabilities are actually risk-neutral probabilities (see Chapter 21). In practice, how-ever, it seems unlikely that the risk premium associated with these contracts is substantial.  WORDS FROM THE STREET \nPrediction markets for the 2012 presidential election.

It operates a fully electronic trading and clearing platform and, in 2004, received clearance from regulators to list contracts in the U.S. In response, the Chicago Board of Trade adopted an electronic platform provided by Eurex\u2019s \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   776bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   776 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 22 Futures Markets 777\nEuropean rival Euronext.liffe,  1   and the CBOT\u2019s Treasury contracts are now traded elec-\ntronically. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange maintains another electronic trading system \ncalled Globex. The electronic markets enable trading around the clock.  \n The CBOT and CME merged in 2007 into one combined company, named the CME \nGroup, with all electronic trading from both exchanges moving onto Globex. It seems \ninevitable that electronic trading will continue to displace floor trading. \n Once a trade is agreed to, the  clearinghouse   enters the picture. Rather than having \nthe long and short traders hold contracts with each other, the clearinghouse becomes the \nseller of the contract for the long position and the buyer of the contract for the short posi-\ntion. The clearinghouse is obligated to deliver the commodity to the long position and to \npay for delivery from the short; consequently, the clearinghouse\u2019s position nets to zero. \nThis arrangement makes the clearinghouse the trading partner of each trader, both long \nand short. The clearinghouse, bound to perform on its side of each contract, is the only \nparty that can be hurt by the failure of any trader to observe the obligations of the futures \ncontract. This arrangement is necessary because a futures contract calls for future perfor-\nmance, which cannot be as easily guaranteed as an immediate stock transaction. \n  Figure\u00a022.3  illustrates the role of the clearinghouse. Panel A shows what would happen \nin the absence of the clearinghouse. The trader in the long position would be obligated to \npay the futures price to the short-position trader, and the trader in the short position would \nbe obligated to deliver the commodity. Panel B shows how the clearinghouse becomes \nan intermediary, acting as the trading partner for each side of the contract. The clearing-\nhouse\u2019s position is neutral, as it takes a long and a short position for each transaction.  \n The clearinghouse makes it possible for traders to liquidate positions easily. If you are \ncurrently long in a contract and want to undo your position, you simply instruct your bro-\nker to enter the short side of a contract to close out your position. This is called a  reversing \ntrade.   The exchange nets out your long and short positions, reducing your net position to \nzero. Your zero net position with the clearinghouse eliminates the need to fulfill at maturity \neither the original long or reversing \nshort position. \n The  open interest   on the con-\ntract is the number of contracts out-\nstanding. (Long and short positions \nare not counted separately, meaning \nthat open interest can be defined \neither as the number of long or short \ncontracts outstanding.) The clear-\ninghouse\u2019s position nets out to zero, \nand so is not counted in the compu-\ntation of open interest. When con-\ntracts begin trading, open interest \nis zero. As time passes, open inter-\nest increases as progressively more \ncontracts are entered. \n There are many apocryphal sto-\nries about futures traders who wake \nup to discover a small  mountain of \n  1 Euronext.liffe is the international derivatives market of Euronext.

But the truth is that futures contracts rarely result in \nactual delivery of the underlying asset. Traders establish long or short positions in con-tracts that will benefit from a rise or fall in the futures price and almost always close out, or reverse, those positions before the contract expires. The fraction of contracts that result in actual delivery is estimated to range from less than 1% to 3%, depending on the com-modity and activity in the contract. In the unusual case of actual deliveries of commodities, they occur via regular channels of supply, most often warehouse receipts. \n You can see the typical pattern of open interest in  Figure\u00a022.1 . In the copper contract, \nfor example, the January delivery contract is approaching maturity, and open interest is small; most contracts have been reversed already. The greatest open interest is in the March contract. For other contracts, for example, gold, for which the nearest maturity date isn\u2019t until February, open interest is typically highest in the nearest contract.  \n  The Margin Account and Marking to Market \n The total profit or loss realized by the long trader who buys a contract at time 0 and closes, or reverses, it at time  t  is just the change in the futures price over the period,  F  \n t  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 . \n Symmetrically, the short trader earns  F  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F   t  . \n The process by which profits or losses accrue to traders is called  marking to market.  At \ninitial execution of a trade, each trader establishes a margin account. The margin is a secu-\nrity account consisting of cash or near-cash securities, such as Treasury bills, that ensures the trader is able to satisfy the obligations of the futures contract. Because both parties to a futures contract are exposed to losses, both must post margin. To illustrate, return to the first corn contract listed in  Figure\u00a022.1 . If the initial required margin on corn, for example, is 10%, then the trader must post $3,620 per contract of the margin account. This is 10% of the value of the contract, $7.24 per bushel\u00a0 3 \u00a05,000 bushels per contract. \n Because the initial margin may be satisfied by posting interest-earning securities, the \nrequirement does not impose a significant opportunity cost of funds on the trader. The ini-tial margin is usually set between 5% and 15% of the total value of the contract. Contracts written on assets with more volatile prices require higher margins. \n On any day that futures contracts trade, futures prices may rise or may fall. Instead of wait-\ning until the maturity date for traders to realize all gains and losses, the clearinghouse requires all positions to recognize profits as they accrue daily. If the futures price of corn rises from 724\u00a0to 726 cents per bushel, the clearinghouse credits the margin account of the long position for 5,000 bushels times 2 cents per bushel, or $100 per contract. Conversely, for the short position, the clearinghouse takes this amount from the margin account for each contract held. \n This daily settling is called  marking to market.  It means the maturity date of the con-\ntract does not govern realization of profit or loss. Instead, as futures prices change, the pro-ceeds accrue to the trader\u2019s margin account immediately. We will provide a more detailed example of this process shortly.  \n Marking to market is the major way in which futures \nand forward contracts differ, besides contract standard-ization. Futures follow this pay-(or receive-)as-you-go method. Forward contracts are simply held until maturity, and no funds are transferred until that date, although the contracts may be traded. \n If a trader accrues sustained losses from daily marking \nto market, the margin account may fall below a critical \nvalue called the  maintenance margin.  If the value of the account falls below this value, \nthe trader receives a margin call, requiring that the margin account be replenished or the position be reduced to a size commensurate with the remaining funds. Margins and \n What must be the net inflow or outlay from \nmarking to market for the clearinghouse?

As a maturing contract calls for immediate delivery, the futures price on that \nday must equal the spot price\u2014the cost of the commodity from the two competing sources is equalized in a competitive market.  \n2   You may obtain delivery of the commod-\nity either by purchasing it directly in the spot market or by entering the long side of a futures contract.  \n A commodity available from two sources (spot or futures market) must be priced identi-\ncally, or else investors will rush to purchase it from the cheap source in order to sell it in the high-priced market. Such arbitrage activity could not persist without prices adjusting to eliminate the arbitrage opportunity. Therefore, the futures price and the spot price must converge at maturity. This is called the  convergence property.  \n For an investor who establishes a long position in a contract now (time 0) and holds that \nposition until maturity (time  T ), the sum of all daily settlements will equal  F  \n T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 , where \n F   T   stands for the futures price at contract maturity. Because of convergence, however, the \nfutures price at maturity,  F   T  , equals the spot price,  P   T  , so total futures profits also may be \nexpressed as  P   T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 . Thus we see that profits on a futures contract held to maturity per-\nfectly track changes in the value of the underlying asset.    Suppose the maintenance margin is 5% while the initial margin was 10% of the value \nof the corn, or $3,620. Then a margin call will go out when the original margin account has fallen in half, by about $1,810. Each 1-cent decline in the corn price results in a $50 loss to the long position. Therefore, the futures price need only fall by 37 cents (or 5% of its current value) to trigger a margin call.  Example 22.1 Maintenance Margin  margin calls safeguard the position of the clearinghouse. Positions are closed out before \nthe margin account is exhausted\u2014the trader\u2019s losses are covered, and the clearinghouse is not put at risk. \n \n  2 Small differences between the spot and futures price at maturity may persist because of transportation costs, but \nthis is a minor factor.  Assume the current futures price for silver for delivery 5 days from today is $30.10 per \nounce. Suppose that over the next 5 days, the futures price evolves as follows:    Example 22.2 Marking to Market \nDay Futures Price\n0 (today) $30.10\n1 30.20\n2 30.25\n3 30.18\n4 30.18\n5 (delivery) 30.21\nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   779bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   779 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n780 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n  Cash versus Actual Delivery \n Most futures contracts call for delivery of an actual commodity such as a particular grade \nof wheat or a specified amount of foreign currency if the contract is not reversed before maturity. For agricultural commodities, where quality of the delivered good may vary, the exchange sets quality standards as part of the futures contract. In some cases, contracts may be settled with higher- or lower-grade commodities. In these cases, a premium or dis-count is applied to the delivered commodity to adjust for the quality difference. \n Some futures contracts call for  cash settlement.  An example is a stock index futures \ncontract where the underlying asset is an index such as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 or the New York Stock Exchange Index. Delivery of every stock in the index clearly would be impractical. Hence the contract calls for \u201cdelivery\u201d of a cash amount equal to the value that the index attains on the maturity date of the contract. The sum of all the daily settle-ments from marking to market results in the long position realizing total profits or losses of  S  \n T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 , where  S   T   is the value of the stock index on the maturity date  T  and  F  0  is the origi-\nnal futures price. Cash settlement closely mimics actual delivery, except the cash value of \nthe asset rather than the asset itself is delivered. \n More concretely, the S&P 500 index contract calls for delivery of $250 times the value \nof the index. At maturity, the index might list at 1,200, the market-value-weighted index of the prices of all 500 stocks in the index. The cash settlement contract calls for delivery of $250\u00a0 3 \u00a01,200, or $300,000 cash in return for $250 times the futures price. This yields \nexactly the same profit as would result from directly purchasing 250 units of the index for $300,000 and then delivering it for $250 times the original futures price.  \n  Regulations \n Futures markets are regulated by the federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC sets capital requirements for member firms of the futures exchanges, authorizes trading in new contracts, and oversees maintenance of daily trading records.  The daily mark-to-market settlements for each contract held by the long position will \nbe as follows:   \n The profit on Day 1 is the increase in the futures price from the previous day, or \n($30.20\u00a0 2 \u00a0$30.10) per ounce. Because each silver contract on the Commodity Exchange \n(CMX) calls for purchase and delivery of 5,000 ounces, the total profit per contract is 5,000 times $.10, or $500. On Day 3, when the futures price falls, the long position\u2019s margin account will be debited by $350. By Day 5, the sum of all daily proceeds is $550. This is exactly equal to 5,000 times the difference between the final futures price of $30.21 and original futures price of $30.10. Because the final futures price equals the spot price on that date, the sum of all the daily proceeds (per ounce of silver held long) also equals  P  \n T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 .

For example, if the price limit on silver contracts were \nset at $1 and silver futures close today at $22.10 per ounce, then trades in silver tomor-row may vary only between $21.10 and $23.10 per ounce. The exchanges may increase or reduce price limits in response to perceived changes in price volatility of the contract. Price limits are often eliminated as contracts approach maturity, usually in the last month of trading. \n Price limits traditionally are viewed as a means to limit violent price fluctuations. This \nreasoning seems dubious. Suppose an international monetary crisis overnight drives up the spot price of silver to $30. No one would sell silver futures at prices for future delivery as low as $22.10. Instead, the futures price would rise each day by the $1 limit, although the quoted price would represent only an unfilled bid order\u2014no contracts would trade at the low quoted price. After several days of limit moves of $1 per day, the futures price would finally reach its equilibrium level, and trading would occur again. This process means no one could unload a position until the price reached its equilibrium level. We conclude that price limits offer no real protection against fluctuations in equilibrium prices.  \n  Taxation \n Because of the mark-to-market procedure, investors do not have control over the tax year in which they realize gains or losses. Instead, price changes are realized gradually, with each daily settlement. Therefore, taxes are paid at year-end on cumulated profits or losses regardless of whether the position has been closed out. As a general rule, 60% of futures gains or losses are treated as long term, and 40% as short term.    \n   Hedging and Speculation \n Hedging and speculating are two polar uses of futures markets. A speculator uses a futures contract to profit from movements in futures prices, a hedger to protect against price movement. \n If speculators believe prices will increase, they will take a long position for expected \nprofits. Conversely, they exploit expected price declines by taking a short position.     22.3 Futures Markets Strategies \n Suppose you believe that crude oil prices are going to increase and therefore decide to \npurchase crude oil futures. Each contract calls for delivery of 1,000 barrels of oil, so for every dollar increase in the futures price of crude, the long position gains $1,000 and the short position loses that amount. \n Conversely, suppose you think that prices are heading lower and therefore sell a \ncontract. If crude oil prices do in fact fall, then you will gain $1,000 per contract for \nevery dollar that prices decline. \n If the futures price for delivery in February is $91.86 and crude oil is selling at the \ncontract maturity date for $93.86, the long side will profit by $2,000 per contract pur-\nchased. The short side will lose an identical amount on each contract sold. On the other hand, if oil has fallen to $89.86, the long side will lose, and the short side will gain, $2,000 per contract.  Example 22.3 Speculating with Oil Futures \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   781bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   781 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n782 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n Why does a speculator buy a futures contract? Why not buy the underlying asset \ndirectly? One reason lies in transaction costs, which are far smaller in futures markets. \n Another important reason is the leverage that futures trading provides. Recall that \nfutures contracts require traders to post margin considerably less than the value of the asset \nunderlying the contract. Therefore, they allow speculators to achieve much greater lever-age than is available from direct trading in a commodity.  \n Suppose the initial margin requirement for the oil contract is 10%. At a current \nfutures price of $91.86, and contract size of 1,000 barrels, this would require margin of .10\u00a0 3 \u00a091.86\u00a0 3 \u00a01,000\u00a0 5 \u00a0$9,186. A $2 jump in oil prices represents an increase of \n2.18%, and results in a $2,000 gain on the contract for the long position. This is a percentage gain of 21.8% in the $9,186 posted as margin, precisely 10 times the per-centage increase in the oil price. The 10-to-1 ratio of percentage changes reflects the leverage inherent in the futures position, because the contract was established with an initial margin of one-tenth the value of the underlying asset.  Example 22.4 Futures and Leverage \n Hedgers, by contrast, use futures to insulate themselves against price movements. A firm \nplanning to sell oil, for example, might anticipate a period of market volatility and wish to \nprotect its revenue against price fluctuations. To hedge the total revenue derived from the sale, the firm enters a short position in oil futures. As the following example illustrates, this locks in its total proceeds (i.e., revenue from the sale of the oil plus proceeds from its futures position).  \n Consider an oil distributor planning to sell 100,000 barrels of oil in February that wishes \nto hedge against a possible decline in oil prices. Because each contract calls for delivery of 1,000 barrels, it would sell 100 contracts that mature in February. Any decrease in prices would then generate a profit on the contracts that would offset the lower sales revenue from the oil. \n To illustrate, suppose that the only three possible prices for oil in February are $89.86, \n$91.86, and $93.86 per barrel. The revenue from the oil sale will be 100,000 times the \nprice per barrel. The profit on each contract sold will be 1,000 times any decline in the futures price. At maturity, the convergence property ensures that the final futures price will equal the spot price of oil. Therefore, the profit on the 100 contracts sold will equal 100,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0( F  \n \u00a00  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P   T  ), where  P   T   is the oil price on the delivery date, and  F   \u00a00   is the original \nfutures price, $91.86. \n Now consider the firm\u2019s overall position. The total revenue in February can be com-\nputed as follows:  Example 22.5 Hedging with Oil Futures \nOil Price in February,\u00a0P T\n$89.86 $91.86 $93.86\n Revenue from oil sale: 100,000\u00a03\u00a0P T $8,986,000 $9,186,000 $9,386,000\n1 Profit on futures:\u00a0100,000\u00a0 3\u00a0(F0\u00a02\u00a0PT)   200,000       0  2200,000\n  TOTAL PROCEEDS $9,186,000 $9,186,000 $9,186,000\nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   782bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   782 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 22 Futures Markets 783\n  Figure\u00a022.4  illustrates the nature of the hedge in Example 22.5. The upward-sloping \nline is the revenue from the sale of oil. The downward-sloping line is the profit on the \nfutures contract. The horizontal line is the sum of sales revenue plus futures profits. This \nline is flat, as the hedged position is independent of oil prices.  \n To generalize Example 22.5, note that oil will sell for  P   T   per barrel at the maturity of \nthe contract. The profit per barrel on the futures will be  F  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P   T  . Therefore, total revenue \nis  P   T  \u00a0 1 \u00a0( F  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P   T  )\u00a0 5 \u00a0 F  0 , which is independent of the eventual oil price. \n The oil distributor in Example 22.5 engaged in a  short hedge,   taking a short futures \nposition to offset risk in the sales price of a particular asset. A  long hedge   is the analogous \nhedge for someone who wishes to eliminate the risk of an uncertain purchase price. For \nexample, a power supplier planning to purchase oil may be afraid that prices might rise by \nthe time of the purchase. As the following Concept Check illustrates, the supplier might \nbuy  oil futures to lock in the net purchase price at the time of the transaction.     The revenue from the oil sale plus the proceeds from the contracts equals the current \nfutures price, $91.86 per barrel. The variation in the price of the oil is precisely offset by \nthe profits or losses on the futures position. For example, if oil falls to $89.86 a barrel, \nthe short futures position generates $200,000 profit, just enough to bring total revenues \nto $9,186,000. The total is the same as if one were to arrange today to sell the oil in \nFebruary at the futures price. \n Suppose as in Example 22.5 that oil will be selling in February for $89.86, $91.86, or $93.86 per barrel. Con-\nsider a firm that plans to buy 100,000 barrels of oil in February. Show that if the firm buys 100 oil contracts \ntoday, its net expenditures in February will be hedged and equal to $9,186,000.

For example, a portfolio manager might want to hedge the value \nof a diversified, actively managed portfolio for a period \nof time. However, futures contracts are listed only on indexed portfolios. Nevertheless, because returns on the manager\u2019s diversified portfolio will have a high corre-lation with returns on broad-based indexed portfolios, an effective hedge may be established by selling index futures contracts. Hedging a position using futures on another asset is called  cross-hedging.    \n  Basis Risk and Hedging \n The  basis  is the difference between the futures price and the spot price.  3   As we have noted, \non the maturity date of a contract, the basis must be zero: The convergence property implies that  F  \n T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P   T  \u00a0 5 \u00a00. Before maturity, however, the futures price for later delivery may differ \nsubstantially from the current spot price.  \n In Example 22.5 we discussed the case of a short hedger who manages risk by entering \na short position to deliver oil in the future. If the asset and futures contract are held until \nmaturity, the hedger bears no risk. Risk is eliminated because the futures price and spot price at contract maturity must be equal: Gains and losses on the futures and the com-modity position will exactly cancel. However, if the contract and asset are to be liquidated early, before contract maturity, the hedger bears  basis risk,  because the futures price and \nspot price need not move in perfect lockstep at all times before the delivery date. In this case, gains and losses on the contract and the asset may not exactly offset each other. \n Some speculators try to profit from movements in the basis. Rather than betting on \nthe direction of the futures or spot prices per se, they bet on the changes in the difference between the two. A long spot\u2013short futures position will profit when the basis narrows.   What are the sources of risk to an investor who \nuses stock index futures to hedge an actively managed stock portfolio? How might you esti-mate the magnitude of that risk?  CONCEPT CHECK 22.4 \n  3 Usage of the word  basis  is somewhat loose. It sometimes is used to refer to the futures-spot difference  F \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P,   and \nsometimes to the spot-futures difference  P \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F.   We will consistently call the basis  F \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P.   \n  4 Yet another strategy is an  intercommodity spread,  in which the investor buys a contract on one commodity and \nsells a contract on a different commodity.  Consider an investor holding 100 ounces of gold, who is short one gold-futures con-\ntract. Suppose that gold today sells for $1,591 an ounce, and the futures price for June delivery is $1,596 an ounce. Therefore, the basis is currently $5. Tomorrow, the spot price might increase to $1,595, while the futures price increases to $1,599, so the basis narrows to $4. \n The investor\u2019s gains and losses are as follows:\n   Gain on holdings of gold (per ounce): $1,595\u00a0 2 \u00a0$1,591\u00a0 5 \u00a0$4  \n  Loss on gold futures position (per ounce): $1,599\u00a0 2 \u00a0$1,596\u00a0 5 \u00a0$3    \n The net gain is the decrease in the basis, or $1 per ounce.  Example 22.6 Speculating on the Basis \n A related strategy is a  calendar spread  position, where the investor takes a long posi-\ntion in a futures contract of one maturity and a short position in a contract on the same \ncommodity, but with a different maturity.  4   Profits accrue if the difference in futures prices \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   784bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   784 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 22 Futures Markets 785\nbetween the two contracts changes in the hoped-for direction, that is, if the futures price \non the contract held long increases by more (or decreases by less) than the futures price on the contract held short.     \n Consider an investor who holds a September maturity contract long and a June contract \nshort. If the September futures price increases by 5 cents while the June futures price increases by 4 cents, the net gain will be 5\u00a0cents\u00a0 2 \u00a04 cents, or 1 cent. Like basis strate-\ngies, spread positions aim to exploit movements in relative price structures rather than to profit from movements in the general level of prices.  Example 22.7 Speculating on the Spread \n   The Spot-Futures Parity Theorem \n We have seen that a futures contract can be used to hedge changes in the value of the \nunderlying asset. If the hedge is perfect, meaning that the asset-plus-futures portfolio has no risk, then the hedged position must provide a rate of return equal to the rate on other risk-free investments. Otherwise, there will be arbitrage opportunities that investors will exploit until prices are brought back into line. This insight can be used to derive the theo-retical relationship between a futures price and the price of its underlying asset. \n Suppose for simplicity that the S&P 500 index currently is at 1,000 and an investor \nwho holds $1,000 in a mutual fund indexed to the S&P 500 wishes to temporarily hedge her exposure to market risk. Assume that the indexed portfolio pays dividends totaling $20 over the course of the year, and for simplicity, that all dividends are paid at year-end. Finally, assume that the futures price for year-end delivery of the S&P 500 contract is 1,010.  \n5   Let\u2019s examine the end-of-year proceeds for various values of the stock index if the \ninvestor hedges her portfolio by entering the short side of the futures contract.      22.4 Futures Prices \nFinal value of stock portfolio, S T $  970 $  990 $1,010 $1,030 $1,050 $1,070\nPayoff from short futures position \n(equals F 0\u00a02\u00a0F T\u00a05\u00a0$1,010\u00a02\u00a0S T)40 20 0 220 240 260\nDividend income     20     20     20     20     20     20\n TOTAL $1,030 $1,030 $1,030 $1,030 $1,030 $1,030\n  5 Actually, the futures contract calls for delivery of $250 times the value of the S&P 500 index, so that each \ncontract would be settled for $250 times the index. With the index at 1,000, each contract would hedge about \n$250\u00a0 3 \u00a01,000\u00a0 5 \u00a0$250,000 worth of stock. Of course, institutional investors would consider a stock portfolio of \nthis size to be quite small. We will simplify by assuming that you can buy a contract for one unit rather than 250 units of the index.   The payoff from the short futures position equals the difference between the original \nfutures price, $1,010, and the year-end stock price. This is because of convergence: The futures price at contract maturity will equal the stock price at that time. \n Notice that the overall position is perfectly hedged. Any increase in the value of the \nindexed stock portfolio is offset by an equal decrease in the payoff of the short futures position, resulting in a final value independent of the stock price. The $1,030 total payoff is \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   785bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   785 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n786 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nthe sum of the current futures price,  F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,010, and the $20 dividend. It is as though the \ninvestor arranged to sell the stock at year-end for the current futures price, thereby elimi-\nnating price risk and locking in total proceeds equal to the futures price plus dividends paid before the sale. \n What rate of return is earned on this riskless position? The stock investment requires an \ninitial outlay of $1,000, whereas the futures position is established without an initial cash outflow. Therefore, the $1,000 portfolio grows to a year-end value of $1,030, providing a rate of return of 3%. More generally, a total investment of  S  \n0 , the current stock price, grows \nto a final value of  F  0 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 D,  where  D  is the dividend payout on the portfolio. The rate of \nreturn is therefore \n  Rate of return on hedged stock portfolio 5(F01D)2S0\nS0  \n This return is essentially riskless. We observe  F  0  at the beginning of the period when \nwe enter the futures contract. While dividend payouts are not perfectly riskless, they are highly predictable over short periods, especially for diversified portfolios. Any uncertainty is  extremely  small compared to the uncertainty in stock prices. \n Presumably, 3% must be the rate of return available on other riskless investments. If \nnot, then investors would face two competing risk-free strategies with different rates of return, a situation that could not last. Therefore, we conclude that \n  (F\n01D)2S0\nS05rf  \n Rearranging, we find that the futures price must be \n   F05S0(11rf)2D5S0(11rf2d)  (22.1)   \n where  d  is the dividend yield on the stock portfolio, defined as  D / S  0 . This result is called \nthe  spot-futures parity theorem.  It gives the normal or theoretically correct relationship \nbetween spot and futures prices. Any deviation from parity would give rise to risk-free \narbitrage opportunities.   \n Suppose that parity were violated. For example, suppose the risk-free interest rate \nwere only 1% so that according to Equation 22.1, the futures price should be $1,000(1.01)\u00a0 2 \u00a0$20\u00a0 5 \u00a0$990. The actual futures price,  F  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1,010, is $20 higher than \nits \u201cappropriate\u201d value. This implies that an investor can make arbitrage profits by short-\ning the relatively overpriced futures contract and buying the relatively underpriced stock portfolio using money borrowed at the 1% market interest rate. The proceeds from this strategy would be as follows:    Example 22.8 Futures Market Arbitrage \nActionInitial \nCash FlowCash Flow in \n1 Year\nBorrow $1,000, repay with interest in 1 year 11,000 21,000(1.01)\u00a05\u00a02$1,010\nBuy stock for $1,000 21,000 ST\u00a01\u00a0$20\u00a0dividend\nEnter short futures position (F 0\u00a05\u00a0$1,010)    0 $1,010\u00a02\u00a0S T       \n TOTAL 0 $20\nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   786bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   786 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 22 Futures Markets 787\n The net initial investment of the strategy is zero. But its cash flow in 1 year is $20 regard-\nless of the stock price. In other words, it is riskless. This payoff is precisely equal to the mispricing of the futures contract relative to its parity value, 1,010\u00a0 2 \u00a0990. \n When parity is violated, the strategy to exploit the mispricing produces an arbitrage \nprofit\u2014a riskless profit requiring no initial net investment. If such an opportunity existed, all \nmarket participants would rush to take advantage of it. The results? The stock price would be bid up, and/or the futures price offered down until Equation 22.1 is satisfied. A similar analysis applies to the possibility that  F  \n0  is less than $990. In this case, you simply reverse the \nstrategy above to earn riskless profits. We conclude, therefore, that in a well- functioning \nmarket in which arbitrage opportunities are competed away,  F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 S  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 D.  \n The arbitrage strategy of Example 22.8 can be represented more generally as follows:   \nAction Initial Cash Flow Cash Flow in 1 Year\n1. Borrow S0 dollars S0 2S0 (1 1 r f)\n2. Buy stock for S 0 2S0 ST 1 D\n3. Enter short futures position 0 F0 2 S T\n      TOTAL 0 F0 2 S 0(1 1 r f) 1 D\n The initial cash flow is zero by construction: The money necessary to purchase the stock \nin step 2 is borrowed in step 1, and the futures position in step 3, which is used to hedge the value of the stock position, does not require an initial outlay. Moreover, the total cash flow at year-end is riskless because it involves only terms that are already known when the contract is entered. If the final cash flow were not zero, all investors would try to cash in on the arbitrage opportunity. Ultimately prices would change until the year-end cash flow is reduced to zero, at which point  F  \n0  would equal  S  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 D.  \n The parity relationship also is called the  cost-of-carry relationship  because it asserts \nthat the futures price is determined by the relative costs of buying a stock with deferred \ndelivery in the futures market versus buying it in the spot market with immediate delivery and \u201ccarrying\u201d it in inventory. If you buy stock now, you tie up your funds and incur a time-value-of-money cost of  r  \n f   per period. On the other hand, you receive dividend pay-\nments with a current yield of  d.  The net carrying cost advantage of deferring delivery of the \nstock is therefore  r   f  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 d  per period. This advantage must be offset by a differential between \nthe futures price and the spot price. The price differential just offsets the cost-of-carry \nadvantage when  F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 S  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 d ). \n The parity relationship is easily generalized to multiperiod applications. We simply rec-\nognize that the difference between the futures and spot price will be larger as the maturity \nof the contract is longer. This reflects the longer period to which we apply the net cost of carry. For contract maturity of  T  periods, the parity relationship is \n   F\n05S0(11rf2d)T  (22.2)    Return to the arbitrage strategy laid out in Example 22.8. What would be the three steps of the strategy \nif  F  0  were too low, say, $980? Work out the cash flows of the strategy now and in 1 year in a table like the \none in the example. Confirm that your profits equal the mispricing of the contract.  CONCEPT CHECK 22.5 \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   787bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   787 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 8 8 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n Notice that when the dividend yield is less than the risk-free rate, Equation 22.2 implies \nthat futures prices will exceed spot prices, and by greater amounts for longer times to contract \nmaturity. But when  d \u00a0>\u00a0 r   f  , as is the case today, the income yield on the stock exceeds the for-\ngone (risk-free) interest that could be earned on the money invested; in this event, the futures \nprice will be less than the current stock price, again by greater amounts for longer maturities. \nYou can confirm that this is so by examining the S&P 500 contract listings in  Figure\u00a022.1 . \n Although dividends of individual securities may fluctuate unpredictably, the annualized \ndividend yield of a broad-based index such as the S&P 500 is fairly stable, recently in the \nneighborhood of a bit more than 2% per year. The yield is seasonal, however, with regular \npeaks and troughs, so the dividend yield for the relevant months must be the one used. \n Figure\u00a022.5  illustrates the yield pattern for the S&P 500. Some months, such as January or \nApril, have consistently low yields, while others, such as May, have consistently high ones.  6\n We have described parity in terms of stocks and stock index futures, but it should be \nclear that the logic applies as well to any financial futures contract. For gold futures, for \nexample, we would simply set the dividend yield to zero. For bond contracts, we would \nlet the coupon income on the bond play the role of dividend payments. In both cases, the \nparity relationship would be essentially the same as Equation 22.2. \n The arbitrage strategy described above should convince you that these parity relation-\nships are more than just theoretical results. Any violations of the parity relationship give \nrise to arbitrage opportunities that can provide large profits to traders. We will see in the \nnext chapter that index arbitrage in the stock market is a tool to exploit violations of the \nparity relationship for stock index futures contracts.  \n  Spreads \n Just as we can predict the relationship between spot and futures prices, there are similar \nways to determine the proper relationships among futures prices for contracts of different \n  6 The very high dividend yield in November 2004 was due to Microsoft\u2019s special one-time dividend of $3 per share. \n01234567\nJan-01\nJul-01\nJan-02\nJul-02\nJan-03\nJul-03\nJan-04\nJul-04\nJan-05\nJul-05\nJan-06\nJul-06\nJan-07\nJul-07\nJan-08\nJul-08\nJan-09\nJul-09\nJan-10\nJul-10\nJan-11\nJul-11\nJan-12\nJul-12\nJan-13Dividend Yield (Annualized, %)\n Figure 22.5 S&P 500 monthly dividend yield \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   788bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   788 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 22 Futures Markets 789\nmaturity dates. Equation 22.2 shows that the futures price is in part determined by time \nto maturity. If the risk-free rate is greater than the dividend yield (i.e.,  r   f  \u00a0>\u00a0 d ), then the \nfutures price will be higher on longer-maturity contracts and if  r   f  \u00a0<\u00a0 d,  longer-maturity \nfutures prices will be lower. You can confirm from  Figure\u00a022.1  that in 2013, when the \nrisk-free rate was below the dividend yield, the longer-maturity S&P 500 contract did have a lower futures price than the shorter term contract. For futures on assets like gold, which pay no \u201cdividend yield,\u201d we can set  d \u00a0 5 \u00a00 and conclude that  F must  increase as \ntime to maturity increases. \n To be more precise about spread pricing, call  F ( T  \n1 ) the current futures price for delivery \nat date  T  1 , and  F ( T  2 ) the futures price for delivery at  T  2 . Let  d  be the dividend yield of the \nstock. We know from the parity Equation 22.2 that \n   F(T1)5S0(11rf2d)T1\n F(T2)5S0(11rf2d)T2  \n As a result, \n  F(T2)/F(T1)5(11rf2d)(T22T1)  \n Therefore, the basic parity relationship for spreads is \n   F(T2)5F(T1)(11rf2d)(T22T1)  (22.3)   \n Equation 22.3 should remind you of the spot-futures parity relationship. The major difference \nis in the substitution of  F ( T  1 ) for the current spot price. The intuition is also similar. Delaying \ndelivery from  T  1  to  T  2  assures the long position that the stock will be purchased for  F ( T  2 ) dol-\nlars at  T  2  but does not require that money be tied up in the stock until  T  2 . The savings realized \nare the net cost of carry between  T  1  and  T   2 . Delaying delivery from  T  1  until  T  2  frees up  F ( T  1 ) \ndollars, which earn risk-free interest at  r   f  . The delayed delivery of the stock also results in the \nlost dividend yield between  T  1  and  T  2 . The net cost of carry saved by delaying the delivery is \nthus  r   f  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 d.  This gives the proportional increase in the futures price that is required to com-\npensate market participants for the delayed delivery of the stock and postponement of the pay-\nment of the futures price. If the parity condition for spreads is violated, arbitrage opportunities will arise. (Problem 19 at the end of the chapter explores this possibility.)  \n To see how to use Equation 22.3, consider the following data for a hypothetical contract: \n  Contract Maturity Data Futures Price\nJanuary 15 $105.00\nMarch 15  104.75 \n Suppose that the effective annual T-bill rate is 1% and that the dividend yield is 2% \nper year. The \u201ccorrect\u201d March futures price relative to the January price is, according to Equation 22.3, \n  \n105(1 1 .01 2 .02)1/6 5 104.82  \n The actual March futures price is 104.75, meaning that the March futures price is slightly \nunderpriced compared to the January futures and that, aside from transaction costs, an arbitrage opportunity seems to be present.

Instead, we have taken the sum of daily mark-to-market proceeds to the long position as  P  \n T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0  and assumed for convenience that the entire profit accrues on the \ndelivery date. Our parity theorems apply only to forward pricing because they assume that \ncontract proceeds are in fact realized only on delivery. In contrast, the actual timing of cash flows conceivably might affect the futures price. \n Futures prices will deviate from parity when marking to market gives a systematic \nadvantage to either the long or short position. If marking to market tends to favor the long position, for example, the futures price should exceed the forward price, because the long position will be willing to pay a premium for the advantage of marking to market. \n When will marking to market favor either a long or short trader? A trader will benefit \nif daily settlements are received (and can be invested) when the interest rate is high and are paid (and can be financed) when the interest rate is low. Because long positions will benefit if futures prices tend to rise when interest rates are high, they will be willing to accept a higher futures price. Therefore, a positive correlation between interest rates and changes in futures prices implies that the \u201cfair\u201d futures price will exceed the forward price. Conversely, a negative correlation means that marking to market favors the short position and implies that the equilibrium futures price should be below the forward price. \n For most contracts, the covariance between futures prices and interest rates is so low \nthat the difference between futures and forward prices will be negligible. However, con-tracts on long-term fixed-income securities are an important exception to this rule. In this case, because prices have a high correlation with interest rates, the covariance can be large enough to generate a meaningful spread between forward and future prices.    \n  So far we have considered the relationship between futures prices and the  current  spot \nprice. What about the relationship between the futures price and the  expected value  of \nthe spot price? In other words, how well does the futures price forecast the ultimate spot \nprice? Three traditional theories have been put forth: the expectations hypothesis, normal backwardation, and contango. Today\u2019s consensus is that all of these traditional hypotheses are subsumed by modern portfolio theory.  Figure\u00a022.7  shows the expected path of futures under the three traditional hypotheses.   \n   Expectations Hypothesis \n The  expectations hypothesis  is the simplest theory of futures pricing. It states that the futures price equals the expected value of the future spot price:  F  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E ( P   T  ). Under this \ntheory the expected profit to either position of a futures contract would equal zero: The \nshort position\u2019s expected profit is  F  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 E ( P   T  ), whereas the long\u2019s is  E ( P   T  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 . With \n F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E ( P   T  ), the expected profit to either side is zero. This hypothesis relies on a notion \nof risk neutrality. If all market participants are risk neutral, they should agree on a futures \nprice that provides an expected profit of zero to all parties. \n The expectations hypothesis resembles market equilibrium in a world with no uncertainty; \nthat is, if prices of goods at all future dates were currently known, then the futures price for delivery at any particular date would equal the currently known future spot price for that date. It is a tempting but incorrect leap to then assert that under uncertainty the futures price should equal the currently  expected   spot price. This view ignores the risk premiums that must be \nbuilt into futures prices when ultimate spot prices are uncertain.     22.5 Futures Prices versus Expected Spot Prices \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   791bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   791 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\n7 9 2 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n  Normal Backwardation \n This theory is associated with the \nfamous British economists John \nMaynard Keynes and John Hicks. \nThey argued that for most com-\nmodities there are natural hedgers \nwho wish to shed risk. For exam-\nple, wheat farmers desire to shed \nthe risk of uncertain wheat prices. \nThese farmers will take short posi-\ntions to deliver wheat at a guaran-\nteed price; they will short hedge. \nTo induce speculators to take the \ncorresponding long positions, the \nfarmers need to offer them an \nexpectation of profit. They will \nenter the long side of the contract \nonly if the futures price is below the \nexpected spot price of wheat, for \nan expected profit of  E ( P   T  )\u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 . \nThe speculators\u2019 expected profit \nis the farmers\u2019 expected loss, but \nfarmers are willing to bear this \nexpected loss to avoid the risk of uncertain wheat prices. The theory of  normal backward-\nation   thus suggests that the futures price will be bid down to a level below the expected spot \nprice and will rise over the life of the contract until the maturity date, at which point  F   T  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 P   T  . \n Although this theory recognizes the important role of risk premiums in futures markets, \nit is based on total variability rather than on systematic risk. (This is not surprising, as \nKeynes wrote almost 40 years before the development of modern portfolio theory.) The \nmodern view refines the measure of risk used to determine appropriate risk premiums.  \n  Contango \n The polar hypothesis to backwardation holds that the natural hedgers are the purchasers of \na commodity, rather than the suppliers. In the case of wheat, for example, we would view \ngrain processors as willing to pay a premium to lock in the price that they must pay for \nwheat. These processors hedge by taking a long position in the futures market; therefore, \nthey are called long hedgers, whereas farmers are short hedgers. Because long hedgers \nwill agree to pay high futures prices to shed risk, and because speculators must be paid a \npremium to enter the short position, the  contango   theory holds that  F  0  must exceed  E ( P   T  ). \n It is clear that any commodity will have both natural long hedgers and short hedgers. \nThe compromise traditional view, called the \u201cnet hedging hypothesis,\u201d is that  F  0  will be \nless than  E ( P   T  ) when short hedgers outnumber long hedgers and vice versa. The strong \nside of the market will be the side (short or long) that has more natural hedgers. The strong \nside must pay a premium to induce speculators to enter into enough contracts to balance \nthe \u201cnatural\u201d supply of long and short hedgers.  \n  Modern Portfolio Theory \n The three traditional hypotheses all envision a mass of speculators willing to enter either \nside of the futures market if they are sufficiently compensated for the risk they incur. \nFuture Prices\nExpectations HypothesisContango\nNormal Backwardation\nTimeE(PT)\nDelivery\nDate\n Figure 22.7 Futures price over time, in the special case that the \nexpected spot price remains unchanged \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   792bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   792 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 22 Futures Markets 793\nModern portfolio theory fine-tunes this approach by refining the notion of risk used in the \ndetermination of risk premiums. Simply put, if commodity prices pose positive systematic risk, futures prices must be lower than expected spot prices. \n To illustrate this approach, consider once again a stock paying no dividends. If  E ( P  \n T  ) \ndenotes the expected time- T  stock price and  k  denotes the required rate of return on the \nstock, then the price of the stock today must equal the present value of its expected future \npayoff as follows:   \n P05E(PT)\n(11k)T  (22.4)   \n We also know from the spot-futures parity relationship that   \n P05F0\n(11rf)T  (22.5)   \n Therefore, the right-hand sides of Equations 22.4 and 22.5 must be equal. Equating these \nterms allows us to solve for  F  0 :   \n F05E(PT)\u00a211rf\n11k\u2264T\n  (22.6)   \n You can see immediately from Equation 22.6 that  F  0  will be less than the expectation of  P   T   \nwhenever  k  is greater than  r   f  , which will be the case for any positive-beta asset. This means \nthat the long side of the contract will make an expected profit [ F  0  will be lower than  E ( P   T  )] \nwhen the commodity exhibits positive systematic risk ( k  is greater than  r   f  ). \n Why should this be? A long futures position will provide a profit (or loss) of  P   T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 . If \nthe ultimate value of  P   T   entails positive systematic risk, so will the profit to the long posi-\ntion. Speculators with well-diversified portfolios will be willing to enter long futures posi-\ntions only if they receive compensation for bearing that risk in the form of positive expected profits. Their expected profits will be positive only if  E ( P  \n T  ) is greater than  F  0 . The short \nposition\u2019s profit is the negative of the long\u2019s and will have \nnegative systematic risk. Diversified investors in the short position will be willing to suffer that expected loss to lower portfolio risk and will be willing to enter the con-tract even when  F  \n0  is less than  E ( P   T  ). Therefore, if  P   T    has \npositive beta,  F  0  must be less than the expectation of  P   T  . \nThe analysis is reversed for negative-beta commodities.       What must be true of the risk of the spot price of \nan asset if the futures price is an unbiased esti-mate of the ultimate spot price?  CONCEPT CHECK 22.6 \n     1 .   Forward contracts call for future delivery of an asset at a currently agreed-on price. The long trader purchases the good, and the short trader delivers it. If the price of the asset at the maturity of the contract exceeds the forward price, the long side benefits by virtue of acquiring the good at the contract price.  \n    2 .   A futures contract is similar to a forward contract, differing most importantly in the aspects of standardization and marking to market, which is the process by which gains and losses on futures contract positions are settled daily. In contrast, forward contracts call for no cash transfers until contract maturity.  \n    3 .   Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges that standardize the size of the contract, the grade of the deliverable asset, the delivery date, and the delivery location. Traders negotiate only over the contract price. This standardization increases liquidity and means that buyers and sellers can easily find many traders for a desired purchase or sale.     SUMMARY \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   793bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   793 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm794 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n    4 .   The clearinghouse steps in between each pair of traders, acting as the short position for each long \nand as the long position for each short. In this way traders need not be concerned about the perfor-mance of the trader on the opposite side of the contract. In turn, traders post margins to guarantee their own performance.  \n    5 .   The long position\u2019s gain or loss between time 0 and time  t  is  F  \n t  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 . Because  F   T  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 P   T  , the long\u2019s \nprofit if the contract is held until maturity is  P   T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 , where  P   T   is the spot price at time  T  and  F  0  \nis the original futures price. The gain or loss to the short position is  F  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 P   T  .  \n    6 .   Futures contracts may be used for hedging or speculating. Speculators use the contracts to take a \nstand on the ultimate price of an asset. Short hedgers take short positions in contracts to offset any gains or losses on the value of an asset already held in inventory. Long hedgers take long posi-tions to offset gains or losses in the purchase price of a good.  \n    7 .   The spot-futures parity relationship states that the equilibrium futures price on an asset providing no service or payments (such as dividends) is  F  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 P  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  )  T  . If the futures price deviates from \nthis value, then market participants can earn arbitrage profits.  \n    8 .   If the asset provides services or payments with yield  d,  the parity relationship becomes \n F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 P  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 d )  T  . This model is also called the cost-of-carry model, because it states that \nfutures price must exceed the spot price by the net cost of carrying the asset until maturity date  T.   \n    9 .   The equilibrium futures price will be less than the currently expected time  T  spot price if the spot \nprice exhibits systematic risk. This provides an expected profit for the long position who bears the \nrisk and imposes an expected loss on the short position who is willing to accept that expected loss as a means to shed systematic risk.

The bond pays \nan annual coupon.  \n   \u2022 An investor intends to buy this bond today and sell it in 6 months.  \nbod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   796bod61671_ch22_770-798.indd   796 7/27/13   1:48 AM7/27/13   1:48 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 22 Futures Markets 797\n   \u2022 The 6-month risk-free interest rate today is 5% (annualized).  \n   \u2022 A 6-month forward contract on this bond is available, with a forward price of $1,024.70.  \n   \u2022  In 6 months, the price of the bond, including accrued interest, is forecast to fall to \n$978.40 as a result of a rise in interest rates.   \n     a.

The risk would be that the index and the portfolio do not move perfectly together. Thus basis \nrisk involving the spread between the futures price and the portfolio value could persist even \nif the index futures price were set perfectly relative to the index itself. You can measure this risk using the index model. If you regress the return of the active portfolio on the return of the index portfolio, the regression R-square will equal the proportion of the variance of the active portfolio\u2019s return that could have been hedged using the index futures contract. You can also measure the risk of the imperfectly hedged position using the standard error of the regression, which tells you the standard deviation of the residuals in the index model. Because these are the components of the risky returns that are independent of the market index, this standard deviation measures the variability of the portion of the active portfolio\u2019s return that  cannot  be hedged using \nthe index futures contract.  \n   5.

This chapter explores both pricing and risk man-agement in selected futures markets in more depth. Most of the growth has been in finan-cial futures, which dominate trading, so we emphasize these contracts. \n    Hedging    refers to techniques that offset \n particular  sources of risk. Hedging activities \ntherefore are more limited and more focused \nthan more ambitious strategies seeking an optimal risk-return profile for an entire port-folio. Because futures contracts are written on specific quantities such as stock index values, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and so on, they are ideally suited for these applications. In this chapter we will con-sider several hedging applications, illustrating general principles using a variety of contracts. We also show how hedging strategies can be used to isolate bets on perceived profit opportunities. \n We begin with foreign exchange futures, \nwhere we show how forward exchange rates \nare determined by interest rate differentials across countries and examine how firms can use futures to manage exchange rate risk. We then move on to stock-index futures, where we focus on program trading and index arbitrage. Next we turn to the most actively traded markets, those for interest rate futures. We also examine commodity futures pricing. Finally, we turn to swaps markets in foreign exchange and fixed-income securities. We will see that swaps can be interpreted as portfolios of forward contracts and valued accordingly.   Futures, Swaps, and Risk \nManagement  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \n   The Markets \n Exchange rates between currencies vary continually and often substantially. This \nvariability can be a source of concern for anyone involved in international business. A U.S. exporter who sells goods in England, for example, will be paid in British pounds, and the dollar value of those pounds depends on the exchange rate at the time payment is made. Until that date, the U.S. exporter is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk. This risk can     23.1 Foreign Exchange Futures \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   799bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   799 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n8 0 0 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nbe hedged through currency futures or forward markets. For example, if you know you \nwill receive \u00a3100,000 in 90 days, you can sell those pounds forward today in the forward \nmarket and lock in an exchange rate equal to today\u2019s forward price. \n The forward market in foreign exchange is fairly informal. It is simply a network of \nbanks and brokers that allows customers to enter forward contracts to purchase or sell \ncurrency in the future at a currently agreed-upon rate of exchange. The bank market in \ncurrencies is among the largest in the world, and most large traders with sufficient credit-\nworthiness execute their trades here rather than in futures markets. Unlike those in futures \nmarkets, contracts in forward markets are not standardized in a formal market setting. \nInstead, each is negotiated separately. Moreover, there is no marking to market, as would \noccur in futures markets. Cur-\nrency forward contracts call for \nexecution only at the maturity \ndate. Participants need to con-\nsider  counterparty risk,   the pos-\nsibility that a trading partner may \nnot be able to make good on its \nobligations under the contract if \nprices move against it. For this \nreason, traders who participate in \nforward markets must have solid \ncreditworthiness. \n Currency  futures,   however, \ntrade in formal exchanges such as \nthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange \n(International Monetary Market) \nor the London International Finan-\ncial Futures Exchange (LIFFE). \nHere contracts are standardized by \nsize, and daily marking to market \nis observed. Moreover, standard \nclearing arrangements allow trad-\ners to enter or reverse positions \neasily. Margin positions are used \nto ensure contract performance, \nwhich is in turn guaranteed by the \nexchange\u2019s clearinghouse, so the \nidentity and creditworthiness of \nthe counterparty to a trade are less \nof a concern. \n  Figure\u00a0 23.1  reproduces  The \nWall Street Journal   listing of \nforeign exchange spot and for-\nward rates. The listing gives the \nnumber of U.S. dollars required \nto purchase some unit of foreign \ncurrency and then the amount of \nforeign currency needed to pur-\nchase $1.

In  Figure\u00a0 23.1 , both spot and forward \nexchange rates are listed for various delivery dates.   \n The forward quotations listed in  Figure\u00a023.1  apply to \nrolling delivery in 30, 90, or 180 days. Thus tomorrow\u2019s \nforward listings will apply to a maturity date 1 day later \nthan today\u2019s listing. In contrast, the futures contracts in \n Figure\u00a023.2  mature on only four dates each year, in March, \nJune, September, and December.  \n  Interest Rate Parity \n As is true of stocks and stock futures, there is a spot-\nfutures exchange rate relationship that will prevail in well-\nfunctioning markets. Should this so-called    interest rate \nparity relationship    be violated, arbitrageurs will be able \nto make risk-free profits in foreign exchange markets with \nzero-net-investment. Their actions will force futures and spot \nexchange rate back into alignment. Another term for interest \nrate parity is the    covered interest arbitrage relationship.      \n We can illustrate the interest rate parity theorem by using two currencies, the U.S. dollar \nand the British (U.K.) pound. Call  E  0  the current exchange rate between the two curren-\ncies, that is,  E  0  dollars are required to purchase one pound.  F  0 , the forward price, is the \nnumber of dollars agreed to today for purchase of one pound at time  T.  Call the risk-free \nrates in the United States and United Kingdom  r  US  and  r  UK , respectively. \n The interest rate parity theorem then states that the proper relationship between  E  0  \nand  F  0  is   \n F05E0 \u00a211rUS\n11rUK\u2264T\n  (23.1)   \n For example, if  r  US \u00a0 5 \u00a0.04 and  r  UK \u00a0 5 \u00a0.05 annually, while  E  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2\u00a0per pound, then the \nproper futures price for a 1-year contract would be   \n$2.00 a1.04\n1.05b5$1.981 per pound   \n Consider the intuition behind Equation 23.1. If  r  US  is less than  r  UK , money invested in \nthe United States will grow at a slower rate than money invested in the United Kingdom. \nIf this is so, why wouldn\u2019t all investors decide to invest their money in the United Kingdom? \nOne important reason why not is that the dollar may be appreciating relative to the pound. \nAlthough dollar investments in the United States grow slower than pound investments in \nthe United Kingdom, each dollar may be worth more pounds in the forward market than \nin the spot market. Such a forward premium can exactly offset the advantage of the higher \nU.K. interest rate. \n To complete the argument, we ask how an appreciating dollar would show up in Equation \n23.1. If the dollar is appreciating, fewer dollars are required to purchase each pound, and the \nforward exchange rate  F  0  (in dollars per pound) will be less than  E  0 , the current exchange \nrate. This is exactly what Equation 23.1 tells us: When  r  US  is less than  r  UK ,\u00a0  F  0  must be \nless than  E  0 . The forward premium of the dollar embodied in the ratio of  F  0  to  E  0  exactly \ncompensates for the difference in interest rates available in the two countries. Of course, the \nargument also works in reverse: If  r  US  is greater than  r  UK , then  F  0  is greater than  E  0 .

Borrow 1 U.K. pound in London. Convert to dollars.     $ E 02$E 1(1 1 r UK)\n2.  Use proceeds of borrowing in London to lend in \nthe U.S.2$E 0        $E 0(1 1 r US)\n3.

The first step requires borrow-\ning one pound in the United Kingdom. With a current exchange rate of  E  0 , the one pound \nis converted into  E  0  dollars, which is a cash inflow. In 1 year the British loan must be paid \noff with interest, requiring a payment in pounds of (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  UK ), or in dollars of  E  1 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  UK ). \nIn the second step the proceeds of the British loan are invested in the United States. This \ninvolves an initial cash outflow of $ E  0 , and a cash inflow of $ E  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  US ) in 1 year. Finally, \nthe exchange risk involved in the British borrowing is hedged in step 3. Here, the (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  UK ) \npounds necessary to satisfy the British loan are purchased ahead in the futures contract. \n The net proceeds to the arbitrage portfolio are risk-free and given by  E  0 (1  1   r  US )  2  \n F  0 (1  1    r  UK ). If this value is positive, borrow in the United Kingdom, lend in the \nUnited States, and enter a long futures position to eliminate foreign exchange risk. If the \nvalue is negative, borrow in the United States, lend in the United Kingdom, and take a  What if the interest rate parity relationship were violated? For example, suppose the \nfutures price is $1.97/\u00a3 instead of $1.981/\u00a3. You could adopt the following strategy. In this example let  E  \n1  denote the exchange rate ($/\u00a3) that will prevail in 1 year.  E  1  is, of \ncourse, a random variable from the perspective of today\u2019s investors. \nAction Initial Cash Flow ($) CF in 1 Year ($)\n1.  Borrow 1 U.K. pound in London. Convert \nto dollars.

After 1 year you must repay the pound borrowed with \ninterest. Because the loan is made in the United Kingdom at the U.K. interest rate, you would repay \u00a31.05, which would be worth  E  \n1 (1.05) dollars. The U.S. loan in step 2 is made \nat the U.S. interest rate of 4%. The futures position in step 3 results in receipt of \u00a31.05, \nfor which you would pay $1.97 each, and then convert into dollars at exchange rate  E  1 . \n Note that the exchange rate risk here is exactly offset between the pound obligation \nin step 1 and the futures position in step 3. The profit from the strategy is therefore risk-\nfree and requires no net investment.

CONCEPT CHECK 23.1 \n  Direct versus Indirect Quotes \n The exchange rate in Examples 23.1 and 23.2 is expressed as dollars per pound. This is an \nexample of a  direct  exchange rate quote. The euro-dollar exchange rate is also typically \nexpressed as a direct quote. In contrast, exchange rates for other currencies such as the Japanese yen or Swiss franc are typically expressed as  indirect  quotes, that is, as units of \nforeign currency per dollar, for example, 92 yen per dollar. For currencies expressed as indirect quotes, depreciation of the dollar would result in a  decrease  in the quoted exchange \nrate ($1 buys fewer yen); in contrast, dollar depreciation versus the pound would show up as a  higher  exchange rate (more dollars are required to buy \u00a31). When the exchange rate is \nquoted as foreign currency per dollar, the domestic and foreign exchange rates in Equation 23.2 must be switched: in this case the equation becomes   \nF\n0 (foreign currency/$ )511rforeign\n11rUS3E0 (foreign currency/$ ) \nIf the interest rate in the U.S. is higher than in Japan, the dollar will sell in the forward market at a lower price (will buy fewer yen) than in the spot market.  \n  Using Futures to Manage Exchange Rate Risk \n Consider a U.S. firm that exports most of its product to Great Britain. The firm is vulner-able to fluctuations in the dollar/pound exchange rate for several reasons. First, the dollar value of the pound-denominated revenue derived from its customers will fluctuate with the exchange rate. Second, the pound price that the firm can charge its customers in the United Kingdom will itself be affected by the exchange rate. For example, if the pound  Ample evidence bears out the interest-rate parity relation. For example, on February 3, \n2013, the dollar-denominated LIBOR interest rate with maturity of 6 months was .48% while the comparable U.K. pound-denominated rate was higher, at .65%. Therefore, we should have expected the forward exchange rate (in $/\u00a3) to be lower than the spot rate. This is exactly what we observed: While the spot rate was $1.5694/\u00a3, the forward rate was $1.5681/\u00a3. More specifically, interest-rate parity would imply that the forward rate should have been 1.5694\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1.0048/1.0065) \n1/2 \u00a0 5 \u00a01.5681, just equal to the actual rate.

However, the firm might not be able to raise the price by 10% if it faces competition from British produc-ers, or if it believes the higher pound-denominated price would reduce demand for its product. \n To offset its foreign exchange exposure, the firm might engage in transactions that bring \nit profits when the pound depreciates. The lost profits from business operations resulting from a depreciation will then be offset by gains on its financial transactions. For example, if the firm enters a futures contract to deliver pounds for dollars at an exchange rate agreed to today, then if the pound depreciates, the futures position will yield a profit. \n To illustrate, suppose that the futures price is currently $2 per pound for delivery in \n3 months. If the firm enters a futures contract with a futures price of $2 per pound, and the exchange rate in 3 months is $1.90 per pound, then the profit to the short position is  F  \n0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F   T  \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2.00\u00a0 2 \u00a0$1.90\u00a0 5 \u00a0$.10\u00a0per pound. \n How many pounds should be sold in the futures market to most fully offset the exposure \nto exchange rate fluctuations? Suppose the dollar value of profits in the next quarter will \nfall by $200,000 for every $.10 depreciation of the pound. To hedge, we need a futures position that provides $200,000 extra  profit  for every $.10 that the pound depreciates. \nTherefore, we need a futures position to deliver \u00a32,000,000. As we have just seen, the profit per pound on the futures contract equals the difference in the current futures price and the ultimate exchange rate; therefore, the foreign exchange profits resulting from a $.10 depreciation  \n1   will equal $.10\u00a0 3 \u00a02,000,000\u00a0 5 \u00a0$200,000.  \n The proper hedge position in pound futures is independent of the actual depreciation in \nthe pound as long as the relationship between profits and exchange rates is approximately linear. For example, if the pound depreciates by only half as much, $.05, the firm would lose only $100,000 in operating profits. The futures position would also return half the profits: $.05\u00a0 3 \u00a02,000,000\u00a0 5 \u00a0$100,000, again just offsetting the operating exposure. \nIf the pound  appreciates,  the hedge position still (unfortunately in this case) offsets the \noperating exposure. If the pound appreciates by $.05, the firm might gain $100,000 from the enhanced value of the pound; however, it will lose that amount on its obligation to deliver the pounds for the original futures price. \n The hedge ratio is the number of futures positions necessary to hedge the risk of the \nunprotected portfolio, in this case the firm\u2019s export business. In general, we can think of the    hedge ratio    as the number of hedging vehicles (e.g., futures contracts) one would \nestablish to offset the risk of a particular unprotected position. The hedge ratio,  H,  in this \ncase is   \n H5Change in value of unprotected position for a given change in exchange rate\nProfit derived from one futures position for the same chan ge in exchan ge rate\n 5$200,000 per $.10 change in $/\u00a3 exchange rate\n$.10 profit per pound delivered per $.10 chan ge in $/\u00a3 exchan ge rate\n5 2,000,000 pounds to be delivered \nBecause each pound-futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange calls for delivery of 62,500 pounds, you would sell 2,000,000/62,500 per contract\u00a0 5 \u00a032\u00a0contracts. \n  1 Actually, the profit on the contract depends on the changes in the futures price, not the spot exchange rate. \nFor simplicity, we call the decline in the futures price the depreciation in the pound. \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   804bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   804 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 23 Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management 805\n One interpretation of the hedge ratio is as a ratio of sensitivities to the underlying source \nof uncertainty. The sensitivity of operating profits is $200,000 per swing of $.10 in the \nexchange rate. The sensitivity of futures profits is $.10 per pound to be delivered per swing \nof $.10 in the exchange rate. Therefore, the hedge ratio is 200,000/.10\u00a0 5 \u00a02,000,000 pounds. \n We could just as easily have defined the hedge ratio in terms of futures contracts. \nBecause each contract calls for delivery of 62,500 pounds, the profit on each contract per \nswing of $.10 in the exchange rate is $6,250. Therefore, the hedge ratio defined in units of \nfutures contracts is $200,000/$6,250\u00a0 5 \u00a032\u00a0contracts, as we found above.  \n Suppose a U.S. investor is harmed when the  dollar   depreciates. Specifically, suppose that its profits decrease \nby $200,000 for every $.05 rise in the dollar/pound exchange rate. How many contracts should the firm \nenter? Should it take the long side or the short side of the contracts?  CONCEPT CHECK 23.2 \n Given the sensitivity of the unhedged position to changes in the exchange rate, calculat-\ning the risk-minimizing hedge position is easy. Estimating that sensitivity is much harder. \nFor the exporting firm, for example, a naive view might focus only on the expected pound-\ndenominated revenue, and then contract to deliver that number of pounds in the futures or \nforward market. This approach, however, fails to recognize that pound revenue is itself a \nfunction of the exchange rate because the U.S. firm\u2019s competitive position in the U.K. is \ndetermined in part by the exchange rate. \n One approach relies, in part, on historical relationships. Suppose, for example, that the \nfirm prepares a scatter diagram as in  Figure\u00a023.3  that relates its business profits (mea-\nsured in dollars) in each of the last 40 quarters to the dollar/pound exchange rate in that \nPro\ufb01ts per\nQuarter\n$2.2 million\n$2.0 million\n$2.00/\u00a3 $1.90/\u00a3Exchange RateSlope = 2 million\n Figure 23.3 Profits as a function of the exchange rate  \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   805bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   805 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n806 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nquarter. Profits generally are lower when the exchange rate is lower, that is, when the \npound depreciates. To quantify that sensitivity, we might estimate the following regres-sion equation:    \nProfits 5 a 1 b ($/\u00a3 exchange rate) \nThe slope of the regression, the estimate of  b,  is the sensitivity of quarterly profits to the \nexchange rate. For example, if the estimate of  b  turns out to be 2,000,000, as in  Figure\u00a023.3 , \nthen on average, a $1  increase  in the value of the pound results in a $2,000,000  increase  in \nquarterly profits. This, of course, is the sensitivity we posited when we asserted that a $.10 drop in the dollar/pound exchange rate would decrease profits by $200,000. \n Of course, one must interpret regression output with care. For example, one would not \nwant to extrapolate the historical relationship between profitability and exchange rates exhibited in a period when the exchange rate hovered between $1.80 and $2.10 per pound to scenarios in which the exchange rate might be forecast at below $1.40 per pound or above $2.50 per pound. \n In addition, extrapolating past relationships into the future can be dangerous. We saw \nin Chapter 8 that regression betas from the index model tend to vary over time; such prob-lems are not unique to the index model. Moreover, regression estimates are just that\u2014estimates. Parameters of a regression equation are sometimes measured with considerable imprecision. \n Still, historical relationships are often a good place to start when looking for the average \nsensitivity of one variable to another. These slope coefficients are not perfect, but they are still useful indicators of hedge ratios.     \n United Millers purchases corn to make cornflakes. When the price of corn increases, the cost of making \ncereal increases, resulting in lower profits. Historically, profits per quarter have been related to the price of corn according to the equation: Profits\u00a0 5 \u00a0$8\u00a0million\u00a0 2 \u00a01\u00a0million\u00a0 3 \u00a0price per bushel. How many bushels \nof corn should United Millers purchase in the corn futures market to hedge its corn-price risk?  CONCEPT CHECK 23.3 \n   The Contracts \n In contrast to most futures contracts, which call for delivery of a specified commodity, \nstock-index contracts are settled by a cash amount equal to the value of the index on the contract maturity date times a multiplier that scales the size of the contract. The total profit to the long position is  S  \n T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0 , where  S   T   is the value of the stock index on the maturity \ndate. Cash settlement avoids the costs that would be incurred if the short trader had to pur-\nchase the stocks in the index and deliver them to the long position, and if the long position then had to sell the stocks for cash. Instead, the long trader receives  S  \n T  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 F  0  dollars, and \nthe short trader  F  0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 S   T   dollars. These profits duplicate those that would arise with actual \ndelivery. \n There are several stock-index futures contracts currently traded.  Table\u00a023.1  lists some \nof the major ones, showing under contract size the multiplier used to calculate contract \nsettlements.

The NASDAQ 100, which is dominated by technology firms, and the Russell 2000 \nindex of small-cap firms have smaller correlations with the large-cap indexes and with \neach other, but even these are above .85.   \n2 We should point out that while these multipliers may make the resulting positions too large for small investors, \nthere are many effectively equivalent futures with smaller multipliers (typically one-fifth the value of the standard \ncontract) called  E-Minis.   \nContract Underlying Market Index Contract Size Exchange\nS&P 500 Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index. $250 times Chicago Mercantile Exchange\nA value-weighted arithmetic \n average of 500 stocks.S&P 500 index\nDow Jones Industrial Dow Jones Industrial Average. $10 times index Chicago Board of Trade\nAverage (DJIA) Price-weighted average of 30 \nfirms.\nRussell 2000 Index of 2,000 smaller firms. $100 times index Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)\nNASDAQ 100 Value-weighted arithmetic \naverage of 100 of the largest \nover-the-counter stocks.$100 times index Chicago Mercantile Exchange\nNikkei 225 Nikkei 225 stock average. $5 times Nikkei Index Chicago Mercantile Exchange\nFTSE 100 Financial Times Stock Exchange \nIndex of 100 U.K. firms.\u00a310 times FTSE Index London International Financial \nFutures Exchange\nDAX-30 Index of 30 German stocks. 25 euros times index Eurex\nCAC-40 Index of 40 French stocks. 10 euros times index Euronext Paris\n Hang Seng  Value-weighted index of \nlargest firms in Hong Kong.  50 Hong Kong \ndollars times index  Hong Kong Exchange \n Table 23.1 \n Sample of stock-index futures \n Table 23.2 \n Correlation coefficients \nusing monthly returns, \n2008\u20132012    S&P  DJIA  Russell  NASDAQ \n S&P 500  1  0.979  0.948  0.928 \n DJIA    1  0.908  0.876 \n Russell 2000      1  0.898 \n NASDAQ 100        1 \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   807bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   807 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n808 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n  Creating Synthetic Stock Positions: An Asset Allocation Tool \n One reason stock-index futures are so popular is that they can substitute for holdings in \nthe underlying stocks themselves. Index futures let investors participate in broad market movements without actually buying or selling large amounts of stock. \n Because of this, we say futures represent \u201csynthetic\u201d holdings of the market portfo-\nlio. Instead of holding the market directly, the investor takes a long futures position in the index. The transaction costs involved in establishing and liquidating futures posi-tions are much lower than taking actual spot positions. \u201cMarket timers,\u201d who speculate on broad market moves rather than on individual securities, are large players in stock-index futures for this reason. \n One means to market time, for example, is to shift between Treasury bills and broad-\nbased stock market holdings. Timers attempt to shift from bills into the market before market upturns, and to shift back into bills to avoid market downturns, thereby profiting from broad market movements. Market timing of this sort, however, can result in huge trading costs. An attractive alternative is to invest in Treasury bills and hold varying amounts of market-index futures contracts, which are far cheaper to trade. \n The strategy works like this. When timers are bullish, they will establish many long \nfutures positions that they can liquidate quickly and cheaply when expectations turn bearish. Rather than shifting back and forth between T-bills and stocks, they buy and hold T-bills and adjust only the futures position. \n You can construct a T-bill plus index futures position that duplicates the payoff to \nholding the stock index itself. Here is how:\n    1. Purchase as many market-index futures contracts as you need to establish your \ndesired stock position. A desired holding of $1,000 multiplied by the S&P 500 index, for example, would require the purchase of four contracts because each contract calls for delivery of $250 multiplied by the index.  \n   2. Invest enough money in T-bills to cover the payment of the futures price at the\ncontract\u2019s maturity date. The necessary investment is simply the present value of the futures price.     \n Suppose that an institutional investor wants to invest $140 million in the market for \n1 month and, to minimize trading costs, chooses to buy the S&P 500 futures contracts as a substitute for actual stock holdings. If the index is now at 1,400, the 1-month delivery futures price is 1,414, and the T-bill rate is 1% per month, it would buy 400 contracts. (Each contract controls $250\u00a0  3 \u00a0 1,400\u00a0  5 \u00a0 $350,000 worth of stock, and \n$140\u00a0million/$350,000\u00a0 5 \u00a0400.) The institution thus has a long position on $100,000 \ntimes the S&P 500 index (400 contracts times the contract multiplier of $250). To cover payment of the futures price, it must buy bills with 100,000 times the present value of the futures price. This equals 100,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1,414/1.01)\u00a0 5 \u00a0$140\u00a0million market value of \nbills. Notice that the $140 million outlay in bills is precisely equal to the amount that would have been needed to buy the stock directly. (The face value of the bills will be 100,000\u00a0 3 \u00a01,414\u00a0 5 \u00a0$141.4\u00a0million.)  Example 23.3 Synthetic Positions Using Stock-Index Futures \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   808bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   808 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 23 Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management 809\n The bills-plus-futures contracts strategy in Example 23.3 may be viewed as a 100% \nstock strategy. At the other extreme, investing in zero futures results in a 100% bills \nposition. Moreover, a short futures position will result in a portfolio equivalent to that obtained by short-selling the stock market index, because in both cases the investor gains from decreases in the stock price. Bills-plus-futures mixtures clearly allow for a flexible and low-transaction-cost approach to market timing. The futures positions may be estab-lished or reversed quickly and cheaply. Also, because the short futures position allows the investor to earn interest on T-bills, it is superior to a conventional short sale of the stock, where the investor may earn little or no interest on the proceeds of the short sale. \n The nearby box illustrates that it is now commonplace for money managers to use \nfutures contracts to create synthetic equity positions in stock markets. The article notes that futures positions can be particularly helpful in establishing synthetic positions in foreign equities, where trading costs tend to be greater and markets tend to be less liquid. \n   This is an artificial, or synthetic, stock position. What is the value of this portfolio at \nthe maturity date? Call  S   T   the value of the stock index on the maturity date  T  and, as \nusual, let  F  0  be the original futures price:\nIn General \n(Per Unit of the Index) Our Numbers\n1. Profits from contract S T 2 F 0 $100,000(S T 2 1,414)\n2. Face value of T-bills F0     141,400,000\n    TOTAL S T 100,000S T\nThe total payoff on the contract maturity date is exactly proportional to the value of \nthe stock index. In other words, adopting this portfolio strategy is equivalent to hold-ing the stock index itself, aside from the issue of interim dividend distributions and tax treatment. \n The market timing strategy of Example 23.3 also can be achieved by an investor who holds an indexed \nstock portfolio and \u201csynthetically exits\u201d the position using futures if and when he turns pessimistic con-cerning the market. Suppose the investor holds $140 million of stock. What futures position added to the stock holdings would create a synthetic T-bill exposure when he is bearish on the market? Confirm that the profits are effectively risk-free using a table like that in Example 23.3.  CONCEPT CHECK 23.4 \n  Index Arbitrage \n Whenever the actual futures price falls outside the no-arbitrage band, there is an opportu-\nnity for profit. This is why the parity relationships are so important. Far from being theo-retical academic constructs, they are in fact a guide to trading rules that can generate large profits.    Index arbitrage    is an investment strategy that exploits divergences between the \nactual futures price and its theoretically correct parity value. \n In principle, index arbitrage is simple. If the futures price is too high, short the futures \ncontract and buy the stocks in the index. If it is too low, go long in futures and short the \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   809bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   809 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n810stocks. You can perfectly hedge your position and should earn arbitrage profits equal to the \nmispricing of the contract.  \n In practice, however, index arbitrage presents challenges in implementation. The prob-\nlem lies in buying \u201cthe stocks in the index.\u201d Selling or purchasing shares in all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 is impractical for two reasons. The first is transaction costs, which may outweigh any profits to be made from the arbitrage. Second, index arbitrage calls for the purchase or sale of shares of 500 different firms simultaneously, and any lags in the execu-tion of such a strategy can destroy the effectiveness of a plan to exploit temporary price discrepancies. Don\u2019t forget that others also will be trying to exploit any deviations from parity, and if they trade first, they may move prices before your trade is executed. \n Arbitrageurs need to trade an entire portfolio of stocks quickly and simultaneously \nif they hope to exploit disparities between the futures price and its corresponding stock index. For this they need a coordinated trading program; hence the term    program trading,      \nwhich refers to purchases or sales of entire portfolios of stocks. Electronic trading enables traders to submit coordinated buy or sell programs to the stock market at once.  \n3    \n The success of these arbitrage positions and associated program trades depends on \nonly two things: the relative levels of spot and futures prices and synchronized trading in the two markets. Because arbitrageurs exploit disparities in futures and spot prices, absolute price levels are unimportant.  \n  Using Index Futures to Hedge Market Risk \n How might a portfolio manager use futures to hedge market exposure? Suppose, for example, that you manage a $30 million portfolio with a beta of .8. You are bullish on the   Got a Bundle to Invest Fast? Think Stock-Index Futures \n As investors go increasingly global and market turbulence \ngrows, stock-index futures are emerging as the favorite way for nimble money managers to deploy their funds. Indeed, in most major markets, trading in stock futures now exceeds the buying and selling of actual shares. \n What\u2019s the big appeal? Speed, ease and cheapness. For \nmost major markets, stock futures not only boast greater \nliquidity but also lower transaction costs than traditional trading methods. \n \u201cWhen I decide it\u2019s time to move into France, Germany \nor Britain, I don\u2019t necessarily want to wait around until \nI find exactly the right stocks,\u201d says Fabrizio Pierallini, manager of New York\u2013based Vontobel Ltd.\u2019s Euro Pacific Fund. \n Mr. Pierallini says he later fine-tunes his market picks \nby gradually shifting out of futures into favorite stocks. \nTo the extent Mr. Pierallini\u2019s stocks outperform the mar-ket, futures provide a means to preserve those gains, even while hedging against market declines. \n For instance, by selling futures equal to the value of \nthe underlying portfolio, a manager can almost completely \ninsulate a portfolio from market moves. Say a manager suc-ceeds in outperforming the market, but still loses 3% while the market as a whole falls 10%. Hedging with futures would capture that margin of out-performance, transform-ing the loss into a profit of roughly 7%. \n Among futures-intensive strategies is \u201cglobal tactical \nasset allocation,\u201d which involves trading whole markets \nworldwide as traditional managers might trade stocks. The growing popularity of such asset-allocation strategies has given futures a big boost in recent years. \n To capitalize on global market swings, \u201cfutures do the \njob for us better than stocks, and they\u2019re cheaper,\u201d said \nJarrod Wilcox, director of global investments at PanAgora Asset Management, a Boston-based asset allocator. Even when PanAgora does take positions in individual stocks, it often employs futures to modify its position, such as by hedging part of its exposure to that particular stock market. \n When it comes to investing overseas, Mr. Wilcox noted, \nfutures are often the only vehicle that makes sense from \na cost standpoint. Abroad, transaction taxes and sky-high commissions can wipe out more than 1% of the money deployed on each trade. By contrast, a comparable trade in futures costs as little as 0.05%.  \n  Source:  Abridged from Suzanne McGee, \u201cGot a Bundle to Invest Fast? \nThink Stock-Index Futures,\u201d  The Wall Street Journal,  February 21, \n1995.

If trading were costless, you could sell your portfolio, place the proceeds in T-bills for 2 months, and then reestablish your position after you perceive that the risk of the downturn has passed. In practice, however, this strategy would result in unacceptable trading costs, not to mention tax problems resulting from the real-ization of capital gains or losses on the portfolio. An alternative approach would be to use stock index futures to hedge your market exposure.  \n Suppose that the S&P 500 index currently is at 1,000. A decrease in the index to 975 \nwould represent a drop of 2.5%. With a portfolio beta of .8, you would expect a loss of .8\u00a0 3 \u00a02.5%\u00a0 5 \u00a02%, or in dollar terms, .02\u00a0 3 \u00a0$30\u00a0million\u00a0 5 \u00a0$600,000. Therefore, the \nsensitivity of your portfolio value to market movements is $600,000 per 25-point move-ment in the S&P 500 index. \n To hedge this risk, you could sell stock index futures. When your portfolio falls in value \nalong with declines in the broad market, the futures contract will provide an offsetting profit. \n The sensitivity of a futures contract to market movements is easy to determine. With \nits contract multiplier of $250, the profit on the S&P 500 futures contract varies by \n$6,250 for every 25-point swing in the index. Therefore, to hedge your market exposure for 2 months, you could calculate the hedge ratio as follows:   \nH5Change in portfolio value\nProfit on one futures contract5$600,000\n$6,250596 contracts   (short)\nYou would enter the short side of the contracts, because you want profits from the con-tract to offset the exposure of your portfolio to the market. Because your portfolio does poorly when the market falls, you need a position that will do well when the market falls.  Example 23.4 Hedging Market Risk \n We also could approach the hedging problem in Example 23.4 using a similar regres-\nsion procedure as that illustrated in  Figure\u00a023.3  for foreign exchange risk. The predicted \nvalue of the portfolio is graphed in  Figure\u00a023.4  as a function of the value of the S&P 500 index. With a beta of .8, the slope of the relationship is 24,000: A 2.5% increase in the index, from 1,000 to 1,025, results in a capital gain of 2% of $30 million, or $600,000. Therefore, your portfolio will increase in value by $24,000 for each increase of one point in the index. As a result, you should enter a short position on 24,000 units of the S&P 500 index to fully offset your exposure to marketwide movements. Because the contract multi-plier is $250 times the index, you need to sell 24,000/250\u00a0 5 \u00a096\u00a0contracts.  \n Notice that when the slope of the regression line relating your unprotected position to \nthe value of an asset is positive, your hedge strategy calls for a  short  position in that asset. \nThe hedge ratio is the negative of the regression slope. This is because the hedge position should offset your initial exposure. If you do poorly when the asset value falls, you need a hedge vehicle that will do well when the asset value falls. This calls for a short position in the asset. \n Active managers sometimes believe that a particular asset is underpriced, but that the \nmarket as a whole is about to fall. Even if the asset is a good buy relative to other stocks in the market, it still might perform poorly in a broad market downturn. To solve this problem, the manager would like to separate the bet on the firm from the bet on the market: The bet on the company must be offset with a hedge against the market exposure that normally would accompany a purchase of the stock. In other words, the manager seeks a    market-neutral bet    on the stock, by which we mean that a position on the stock \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   811bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   811 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n8 1 2 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nis taken to capture its alpha (its abnormal risk-adjusted expected return), but that market \nexposure is fully hedged, resulting in a position beta of zero. \n By allowing investors to hedge market performance, the futures contract allows the port-\nfolio manager to make stock picks without concern for the market exposure of the stocks \nchosen. After the stocks are chosen, the resulting market risk of the portfolio can be modu-\nlated to any degree using the stock futures contracts. Here again, the stock\u2019s beta is the key \nto the hedging strategy. We discuss market-neutral strategies in more detail in Chapter 26.     \nPredicted Value\nof Portfolio\nSlope = 24,000\nS&P 500\nIndex$30.6 million\n$30 million\n1,000 1,025\n Figure 23.4 Predicted value of the portfolio as a function of the market index  \n Suppose the beta of the stock is 2\u20443, and the manager purchases $375,000 worth of the \nstock.

The S&P 500 contract will fall by 30 points \nfrom a current value of 1,000 if the market drops 3%.

Consider, for example, these problems:\n    1. A fixed-income manager holds a bond portfolio on which considerable capital gains \nhave been earned. She foresees an increase in interest rates but is reluctant to sell her portfolio and replace it with a lower-duration mix of bonds because such rebal-ancing would result in large trading costs as well as realization of capital gains for tax purposes. Still, she would like to hedge her exposure to interest rate increases.  \n   2. A corporation plans to issue bonds to the public. It believes that now is a good time \nto act, but it cannot issue the bonds for another 3 months because of the lags inher-ent in SEC registration. It would like to hedge the uncertainty surrounding the yield at which it eventually will be able to sell the bonds.  \n   3. A pension fund will receive a large cash inflow next month that it plans to invest in \nlong-term bonds. It is concerned that interest rates may fall by the time it can make the investment and would like to lock in the yield currently available on long-term issues.    \n In each of these cases, the investment manager wishes to hedge interest rate uncertainty. \nTo illustrate the procedures that might be followed, we will focus on the first example, and suppose that the portfolio manager has a $10 million bond portfolio with a modified duration of 9 years.  \n4   If, as feared, market interest rates increase and the bond portfolio\u2019s \nyield also rises, say, by 10 basis points (.10%), the fund will suffer a capital loss. Recall from Chapter 16 that the capital loss in percentage terms will be the product of modified duration,  D *, and the change in the portfolio yield. Therefore, the loss will be\n    \nD* 3 Dy 5 9 3 .10% 5 .90% \nor $90,000. This establishes that the sensitivity of the value of the unprotected portfolio to changes in market yields is $9,000 per 1 basis point change in the yield. Market prac-titioners call this ratio the    price value of a basis point,      or PVBP. The PVBP represents \nthe sensitivity of the dollar value of the portfolio to changes in interest rates. Here, we\u2019ve shown that   \nPVBP5Change in portfolio value\nPredicted chan ge in yield5$90,000\n10 basis points5$9,000 per basis point   \n One way to hedge this risk is to take an offsetting position in an interest rate futures \ncontract, for example, the Treasury bond contract. The bond nominally calls for delivery of $100,000 par value T-bonds with 6% coupons and 20-year maturity. In practice, the contract delivery terms are fairly complicated because many bonds with different coupon rates and maturities may be substituted to settle the contract. However, we will assume that the bond to be delivered already is known and has a modified duration of 10 years. Finally, suppose that the futures price currently is $90 per $100 par value. Because the contract requires delivery of $100,000 par value of bonds, the contract multiplier is $1,000.    23.3 Interest Rate Futures \n  4 Recall that modified duration,  D *, is related to duration,  D,  by the formula  D *\u00a0 5 \u00a0 D /(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 y ), where  y  is the bond\u2019s \nyield to maturity. If the bond pays coupons semiannually, then  y  should be measured as a semiannual yield. \nFor simplicity, we will assume annual coupon payments, and treat  y  as the effective annual yield to maturity. \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   813bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   813 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n8 1 4 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n Given these data, we can calculate the PVBP for the futures contract. If the yield on the \ndelivery bond increases by 10 basis points, the bond value will fall by  D *  3  .1%  5  10  3\n.1%  5  1%. The futures price also will decline 1%, from 90 to 89.10.  5   Because the \ncontract multiplier is $1,000, the gain on each short contract will be $1,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0.90\u00a0 5 \u00a0$900. \nTherefore, the PVBP for one futures contract is $900/10-basis-point change, or $90 for \na change in yield of 1 basis point.   \n Now we can easily calculate the hedge ratio as follows:   \nH5PVBP of portfolio\nPVBP of hed ge vehicle5$9,000\n$90 per contract5100 contracts  \nTherefore, 100 T-bond futures contracts will offset the portfolio\u2019s exposure to interest rate \nfluctuations. \n Notice that this is another example of a market-neutral strategy. In Example 23.5, which \nillustrated an equity-hedging strategy, stock-index futures were used to drive a portfolio \nbeta to zero. In this application, we used a T-bond contract to drive the interest rate expo-\nsure of a bond position to zero. The hedged fixed-income position has a duration (or a \nPVBP) of zero. The source of risk differs, but the hedging strategy is essentially the same.  \n5 This assumes the futures price will be exactly proportional to the bond price, which ought to be nearly true. \n7\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014Yield Spread (%)6\n Figure 23.5 Yield spread between 10-year Treasury and Baa-rated corporate bonds  \n Suppose the bond portfolio is twice as large, $20 million, but that its modified duration is only 4.5 years. Show \nthat the proper hedge position in T-bond futures is the same as the value just calculated, 100 contracts.  CONCEPT CHECK 23.5 \n Although the hedge ratio is easy to compute, the hedging problem in practice is more dif-\nficult. We assumed in our example that the yields on the T-bond contract and the bond portfolio \nwould move perfectly in unison. Although interest rates on various fixed-income instruments \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   814bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   814 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 23 Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management 815\ndo tend to vary in tandem, there is considerable slippage across sectors of the fixed-income mar-\nket. For example,  Figure\u00a023.5  shows that the spread between long-term corporate and 10-year Treasury bond yields has fluctuated considerably over time. Our hedging strategy would be fully effective only if the yield spread across the two sectors of the fixed-income market were constant (or at least perfectly predictable) so that yield changes in both sectors were equal.  \n This problem highlights the fact that most hedging activity is in fact    cross-hedging,      \nmeaning that the hedge vehicle is a different asset than the one to be hedged. To the extent that there is slippage between prices or yields of the two assets, the hedge will not be perfect. Cross-hedges can eliminate a large fraction of the total risk of the unprotected portfolio, but you should be aware that they typically are far from risk-free positions.    \n  6 Interest rate swaps have nothing to do with the Homer-Liebowitz bond swap taxonomy described in Chapter 16. \n  7 The participants to the swap do not loan each other money. They agree only to exchange a fixed cash flow for a \nvariable cash flow that depends on the short-term interest rate. This is why the principal is described as  notional.  \nThe notional principal is simply a way to describe the size of the swap agreement. In this example, a 7% fixed \nrate is exchanged for the LIBOR rate; the difference between LIBOR and 7% is multiplied by notional principal to determine the net cash flow.  Swaps are multiperiod extensions of forward contracts. For example, rather than agreeing \nto exchange British pounds for U.S. dollars at an agreed-upon forward price at one single date, a    foreign exchange swap    would call for an exchange of currencies on several future \ndates. The parties might exchange $1.6 million for \u00a31 million in each of the next 5 years. Similarly,    interest rate swaps    call for the exchange of a series of cash flows proportional to \na given interest rate for a corresponding series of cash flows proportional to a floating inter-est rate.  \n6   One party might exchange a variable cash flow equal to $1 million times a short-\nterm interest rate for $1 million times a fixed interest rate of 5% for each of the next 7 years.   \n The swap market is a huge component of the derivatives market, with well over $500 \ntrillion in swap agreements outstanding. We will illustrate how these contracts work by using a simple interest rate swap as an example. \n    23.4 Swaps  \n Consider the manager of a large portfolio that currently includes $100 million par value \nof long-term bonds paying an average coupon rate of 7%. The manager believes inter-est rates are about to rise. As a result, he would like to sell the bonds and replace them with either short-term or floating-rate issues. However, it would be exceedingly expensive in terms of transaction costs to replace the portfolio every time the forecast for interest rates is updated. A cheaper and more flexible approach is to \u201cswap\u201d the $7 million a year in interest income the portfolio currently generates for an amount of money tied to the short-term interest rate. That way, if rates do rise, so will the portfolio\u2019s interest income. \n A swap dealer might advertise its willingness to exchange, or \u201cswap,\u201d a cash flow \nbased on the 6-month LIBOR rate for one based on a fixed rate of 7%. (The LIBOR, or \nLondon Interbank Offered Rate, is the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other in the Eurodollar market. It is the most commonly used short-term interest rate in the swap market.) The portfolio manager would then enter into a swap agreement with the dealer to  pay  7% on    notional principal    of $100 million and receive payment of the \nLIBOR rate on that amount of notional principal.  \n7   In other words, the manager swaps a  Example 23.6 Interest Rate Swap \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   815bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   815 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n816 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n  Swaps and Balance Sheet Restructuring \n Example 23.6 illustrates why swaps have tremendous appeal to fixed-income managers. \nThese contracts provide a means to quickly, cheaply, and anonymously restructure the balance sheet. Suppose a corporation that has issued fixed-rate debt believes that interest rates are likely to fall; it might prefer to have issued floating-rate debt. In principle, it could issue floating-rate debt and use the proceeds to buy back the outstanding fixed-rate debt. But it is faster and easier to convert the outstanding fixed-rate debt into synthetic floating-rate debt by entering a swap to receive a fixed interest rate (offsetting its fixed-rate coupon obligation) and paying a floating rate. \n Conversely, a bank that pays current market interest rates to its depositors, and thus is \nexposed to increases in rates, might wish to convert some of its financing to a fixed-rate basis. It would enter a swap to receive a floating rate and pay a fixed rate on some amount of notional principal. This swap position, added to its floating-rate deposit liability, would result in a net liability of a fixed stream of cash. The bank might then be able to invest in long-term fixed-rate loans without encountering interest rate risk. \n For another example, consider a fixed-income portfolio manager. Swaps enable the \nmanager to switch back and forth between a fixed- or floating-rate profile quickly and cheaply as the forecast for the interest rate changes. A manager who holds a fixed-rate portfolio can transform it into a synthetic floating-rate portfolio by entering a pay fixed\u2013receive floating swap and can later transform it back by entering the opposite side of a similar swap. \n Foreign exchange swaps also enable the firm to quickly and cheaply restructure its bal-\nance sheet. Suppose, for example, that a firm issues $10 million in debt at an 8% coupon rate, but actually prefers that its interest obligations be denominated in British pounds. For example, the issuing firm might be a British corporation that perceives advantageous financing opportunities in the United States but prefers pound-denominated liabilities. Then the firm, whose debt currently obliges it to make dollar-denominated payments payment of .07\u00a0 3 \u00a0$100\u00a0million for a payment of LIBOR\u00a0 3 \u00a0$100\u00a0million. The manager\u2019s \n net  cash flow from the swap agreement is therefore (LIBOR\u00a0 2 \u00a0.07)\u00a0 3 \u00a0$100\u00a0million. Note \nthat the swap arrangement does not mean that a loan has been made. The participants \nhave agreed only to exchange a fixed cash flow for a variable one.  \n Now consider the net cash flow to the manager\u2019s portfolio in three interest rate scenarios: \nLIBOR Rate\n6.5% 7.0% 7.5%\nInterest income from bond portfolio \n(5 7% of $100 million bond portfolio) $7,000,000 $7,000,000 $7,000,000\nCash flow from swap [5 (LIBOR 2  7%) 3  notional principal of $100 million]\n       (500,000)          0    500,000\nTotal (5  LIBOR 3  $100 million) $6,500,000 $7,000,000 $7,500,000\n Notice that the total income on the overall position\u2014bonds plus swap agreement\u2014\nequals the LIBOR rate in each scenario times $100 million. The manager has, in effect, converted a fixed-rate bond portfolio into a synthetic floating-rate portfolio. \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   816bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   816 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 23 Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management 817\nof $800,000, can agree to swap a given number of pounds each year for $800,000. By \nso doing, it effectively covers its dollar obligation and replaces it with a new pound-denominated obligation. \n  \n Show how a firm that has issued a floating-rate bond with a coupon equal to the LIBOR rate can use swaps \nto convert that bond into synthetic fixed-rate debt. Assume the terms of the swap allow an exchange of LIBOR for a fixed rate of 8%.  CONCEPT CHECK 23.6 \n  8 Actually, things are a bit more complicated. The dealer is more than just an intermediary because it bears the \ncredit risk that one or the other of the parties to the swap might default on the obligation. Referring to  Figure\u00a023.6 , \nif firm A defaults on its obligation, for example, the swap dealer still must maintain its commitment to firm B. In this sense, the dealer does more than simply pass through cash flows to the other swap participants.  A pension fund holds a portfolio of money market securities that the manager believes are paying excel-\nlent yields compared to other comparable-risk short-term securities. However, the manager believes that interest rates are about to fall. What type of swap will allow the fund to continue to hold its portfolio of short-term securities while at the same time benefiting from a decline in rates?  CONCEPT CHECK 23.7   The Swap Dealer \n What about the swap dealer? Why is the dealer, which is typically a financial intermediary \nsuch as a bank, willing to take on the opposite side of the swaps desired by these partici-pants in these hypothetical swaps? \n Consider a dealer who takes on one side of a swap, let\u2019s say paying LIBOR and receiv-\ning a fixed rate. The dealer will search for another trader in the swap market who wishes to receive a fixed rate and pay LIBOR. For example, Company A may have issued a 7% coupon fixed-rate bond that it wishes to convert into synthetic floating-rate debt, while Company B may have issued a floating-rate bond tied to LIBOR that it wishes to convert into synthetic fixed-rate debt. The dealer will enter a swap with Company A in which it pays a fixed rate and receives LIBOR, and will enter another swap with Company B in which it pays LIBOR and receives a fixed rate. When the two swaps are combined, the dealer\u2019s position is effec-tively neutral on interest rates, paying LIBOR on one swap and receiving it on another. Simi-larly, the dealer pays a fixed rate on one swap and receives it on another. The dealer becomes little more than an intermediary, funneling payments from one party to the other.  \n8   The dealer \nfinds this activity profitable because it will charge a bid-ask spread on the transaction.    \n This rearrangement is illustrated in  Figure\u00a023.6 . Company A has issued 7% fixed-rate \ndebt (the leftmost arrow in the figure) but enters a swap to pay the dealer LIBOR and receive a 6.95% fixed rate. Therefore, the company\u2019s net payment is 7%\u00a0 1 \u00a0(LIBOR\u00a0 2  \u00a06.95%)\u00a0 5 \u00a0\nLIBOR\u00a0 1 \u00a0.05%. It has thus transformed its fixed-rate debt into synthetic floating-rate debt. \nConversely, Company B has issued floating-rate debt paying LIBOR (the rightmost arrow), but enters a swap to pay a 7.05% fixed rate in return for LIBOR. Therefore, its net payment is LIBOR\u00a0 1 \u00a0(7.05%\u00a0 2  \u00a0LIBOR)\u00a0 5  \u00a07.05%. It has thus transformed its floating-rate debt \ninto synthetic fixed-rate debt. The bid-ask spread, the source of the dealer\u2019s profit, in the example illustrated in  Figure\u00a023.6  is .10% of notional principal each year. \n  \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   817bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   817 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n8 1 8 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n  Other Interest Rate Contracts \n Swaps are multiperiod forward contracts that trade over the counter. There are also \nexchange-listed contracts that trade on interest rates. The biggest of these in terms of \ntrading activity is the Eurodollar contract, the listing for which we show in  Figure\u00a023.7 . \nThe profit on this contract is proportional to the difference between the LIBOR rate at \ncontract maturity and the contract rate entered into at contract inception. There are analogous \nrates on interbank loans in other currencies. For example, one close cousin of LIBOR is \nEURIBOR, which is the rate at which euro-denominated interbank loans within the euro \nzone are offered by one prime bank to another.  \n The listing conventions for the Eurodollar contract are a bit peculiar. Consider, for \nexample, the first contract listed, which matures in February 2013. The settlement price \nis presented as  F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a099.7075, or approximately 99.71. However, this value is not really \na price. In effect, participants in the contract negotiate over the contract interest rate, and \nthe so-called futures price is actually set equal to 100\u00a0 2 \u00a0contract rate. Because the futures \nprice is 99.71, the contract rate is 100\u00a0 2 \u00a099.71, or .29%. Similarly, the final futures price \non contract maturity date will be marked to  F   T  \u00a0 5 \u00a0100\u00a0 2 \u00a0LIBOR  T  . Thus, profits to the \nbuyer of the contract will be proportional to   \nFT 2 F0 5 (100 2 LIBOR T) 2 (100 2 Contract rate) 5 Contract rate 2 LIBOR T \nThus, the contract design allows participants to \ntrade directly on the LIBOR rate. The contract \nmultiplier is $1 million, but the LIBOR rate on \nwhich the contract is written is a 3-month (quar-\nterly) rate; for each basis point that the (annu-\nalized) LIBOR increases, the quarterly interest \nrate increases by only \u00bc of a basis point, and the \nprofit to the buyer decreases by   \n.0001\u00a03\u00a0\u00bc\u00a03\u00a0$1,000,000\u00a05\u00a0$25  \n Examine the payoff on the contract, and you \nwill see that, in effect, the Eurodollar contract \nallows traders to \u201cswap\u201d a fixed interest rate \n(the contract rate) for a floating rate (LIBOR). \nCompany A Swap Dealer Company B\nLIBOR6.95% 7.05%\n7% Coupon\nLIBOR\nLIBOR\n Figure 23.6 Interest rate swap.

Moreover, while not presented in  The Wall Street Journal,   \nsignificant trading in Eurodollars takes place for contract maturities extending out to 10 years. Contracts with such long-term maturities are quite unusual. They reflect the fact that the Eurodollar contract is used by dealers in long-term interest rate swaps as a hedging tool.  \n  Swap Pricing \n How can the fair swap rate be determined? For example, how would we know that an exchange of LIBOR is a fair trade for a fixed rate of 6%? Or, what is the fair swap rate between dollars and pounds for a foreign exchange swap? To answer these ques-tions we can exploit the analogy between a swap agreement and forward or futures contract. \n Consider a swap agreement to exchange dollars for pounds for one period only. Next \nyear, for example, one might exchange $1 million for \u00a3.5 million. This is no more than a simple forward contract in foreign exchange. The dollar-paying party is contracting to buy British pounds in 1 year for a number of dollars agreed to today. The forward exchange rate for 1-year delivery is  F  \n1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2.00/pound. We know from the interest rate parity rela-\ntionship that this forward price should be related to the spot exchange rate,  E  0 , by the for-\nmula  F  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  US )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  UK ). Because a one-period swap is in fact a forward contract, \nthe fair swap rate is also given by the parity relationship. \n Now consider an agreement to trade foreign exchange for two periods. This agreement \ncould be structured as a portfolio of two separate forward contracts. If so, the forward price for the exchange of currencies in 1 year would be  F  \n1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  US )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  UK ), while the \nforward price for the exchange in the second year would be  F  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 E  0 [(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  US )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   UK  )] 2 . \nAs an example, suppose that  E  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2.03/pound,\u00a0 r  US \u00a0 5 \u00a05%, and  r  UK \u00a0 5 \u00a07%. Then, using the \nparity relationship, prices for forward delivery would be  F  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2.03/\u00a3\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1.05/1.07)\u00a0 5 \u00a0\n$1.992/\u00a3 and  F  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2.03/\u00a3\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1.05/1.07) 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1.955/\u00a3.  Figure 23.8, panel A  illustrates this \nsequence of cash exchanges assuming that the swap calls for delivery of one pound in each \nyear. Although the dollars to be paid in each of the 2 years are known today, they differ from year to year.  \n In contrast, a swap agreement to exchange currency for 2 years would call for a fixed \nexchange rate to be used for the duration of the swap. This means that the same number of dollars would be paid per pound in each year, as illustrated in  Figure 23.8, panel B . Because the forward prices for delivery in each of the next 2 years are $1.992/\u00a3 and $1.955/\u00a3, the fixed exchange rate that makes the two-period swap a fair deal must be between these two values. Therefore, the dollar payer underpays for the pound in the first year (compared to the forward exchange rate) and overpays in the second year. Thus, the swap can be viewed as a portfolio of forward transactions, but instead of each transaction being priced indepen-dently, one forward price is applied to all of the transactions. \n Given this insight, it is easy to determine the fair swap price. If we were to purchase \none pound per year for 2 years using two independent forward agreements, we would pay  F  \n1  dollars in 1 year and  F  2  dollars in 2 years. If instead we enter a swap, we pay a \nconstant rate of  F * dollars per pound. Because both strategies must be equally costly, we \nconclude that   \nF1\n11y11F2\n(11y2)25F*\n11y11F*\n(11y2)2 \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   819bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   819 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\nA: Two forward contracts, each\npriced independently\n$1.992 $1.955\n\u00a31 \u00a31B: Two-year swap agreement\n$1.974 $1.974\n\u00a31 \u00a31\n Figure 23.8 Forward contracts versus swaps  8 2 0 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nwhere  y  1  and  y  2  are the appropriate yields from the yield curve for discounting dollar cash \nflows of 1- and 2-year maturities, respectively.

The same principle would apply to a foreign exchange \nswap of any other maturity. In essence, we need to find the level annuity,  F *, with the same \npresent value as the stream of annual cash flows that would be incurred in a sequence of \nforward rate agreements. \n Interest rate swaps can be subjected to precisely the same analysis. Here, the forward \ncontract is on an interest rate. For example, if you swap LIBOR for a 7% fixed rate with \nnotional principal of $100, then you have entered a forward contract for delivery of $100 \ntimes LIBOR for a fixed \u201cforward\u201d price of $7. If the swap agreement is for many periods, \nthe fair spread will be determined by the entire sequence of interest rate forward prices \nover the life of the swap.  \n  Credit Risk in the Swap Market \n The rapid growth of the swap market has given rise to increasing concern about credit risk \nin these markets and the possibility of a default by a major swap trader. Actually, although \ncredit risk in the swap market certainly is not trivial, it is not nearly as large as the magni-\ntude of notional principal in these markets would suggest. To see why, consider a simple \ninterest rate swap of LIBOR for a fixed rate. \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   820bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   820 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 23 Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management 821\n At the time the transaction is initiated, it has zero net present value to both parties for the \nsame reason that a futures contract has zero value at inception: Both are simply contracts \nto exchange cash in the future at terms established today that make both parties willing to enter into the deal. Even if one party were to back out of the deal at this moment, it would not cost the counterparty anything, because another trader could be found to take its place. \n Once interest or exchange rates change, however, the situation is not as simple. Sup-\npose, for example, that interest rates increase shortly after an interest-rate swap agree-ment has begun. The floating-rate payer therefore suffers a loss, while the fixed-rate payer enjoys a gain. If the floating-rate payer reneges on its commitment at this point, the fixed-rate payer suffers a loss. However, that loss is not as large as the notional principal of the swap, for the default of the floating-rate payer relieves the fixed-rate payer from its obligation as well. The loss is only the  difference  between the values of the fixed-rate and \nfloating-rate obligations, not the  total  value of the payments that the floating-rate payer \nwas obligated to make. \n  \n Consider a swap written on $1 million of notional principal that calls for exchange \nof LIBOR for a fixed rate of 8% for 5 years. Suppose, for simplicity, that the yield curve is currently flat at 8%. With LIBOR thus equal to 8%, no cash flows will be exchanged unless interest rates change. But now suppose that the yield curve imme-diately shifts up to 9%. The floating-rate payer now is obligated to pay a cash flow of (.09\u00a0 2 \u00a0.08)\u00a0 3 \u00a0$1\u00a0million\u00a0 5 \u00a0$10,000 each year to the fixed-rate payer (as long as \nrates remain at 9%). If the floating-rate payer defaults on the swap, the fixed-rate \npayer loses the prospect of that 5-year annuity. The present value of that annuity is $10,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0Annuity factor(9%,\u00a05\u00a0years)\u00a0 5 \u00a0$38,897. This loss may not be trivial, but it \nis less than 4% of notional principal. We conclude that the credit risk of the swap is far \nless than notional principal.  Example 23.7 Credit Risk in Swaps \n  Credit Default Swaps \n Despite the similarity in names, a    credit default swap,      or CDS, is not the same type of \ninstrument as interest rate or currency swaps. As we saw in Chapter 14, payment on a CDS \nis tied to the financial status of one or more reference firms; the CDS therefore allows two counterparties to take positions on the credit risk of those firms. When a particular \u201ccredit event\u201d is triggered, say, default on an outstanding bond or failure to pay interest, the seller of protection is expected to cover the loss in the market value of the bond. For example, the swap seller may be obligated to pay par value to take delivery of the defaulted bond (in which case the swap is said to entail physical settlement) or may instead pay the swap buyer the difference between the par value and market value of the bond (termed cash settlement). The swap purchaser pays a periodic fee to the seller for this protection against credit events. \n Unlike interest rate swaps, credit default swaps do not entail periodic netting of one \nreference rate against another. They are in fact more like insurance policies written on par-ticular credit events. Bondholders may buy these swaps to transfer their credit risk expo-sure to the swap seller, effectively enhancing the credit quality of their portfolios. Unlike insurance policies, however, the swap holder need not hold the bonds underlying the CDS contract; therefore, credit default swaps can be used purely to speculate on changes in the credit standing of the reference firms.    \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   821bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   821 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n822 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n  9 Robert A. Jarrow and George S. Oldfield, \u201cForward Contracts and Futures Contracts,\u201d  Journal of Financial \nEconomics  9 (1981).  Commodity futures prices are governed by the same general considerations as stock futures. \nOne difference, however, is that the cost of \u201ccarrying\u201d commodities, especially those subject to spoilage, is greater than the cost of carrying financial assets. The underlying asset for some contracts, such as electricity futures, simply cannot be \u201ccarried\u201d or held in portfolio. Finally, spot prices for some commodities demonstrate marked seasonal patterns that can affect futures pricing.  \n   Pricing with Storage Costs \n The cost of carrying commodities includes, in addition to interest costs, storage costs, insurance costs, and an allowance for spoilage of goods in storage. To price commodity futures, reconsider the earlier arbitrage strategy that calls for holding both the asset and a short position in the futures contract on the asset. In this case we will denote the price of the commodity at time  T  as  P  \n T  , and assume for simplicity that all noninterest carrying costs \n( C ) are paid in one lump sum at time  T,  the contract maturity. Carrying costs appear in the \nfinal cash flow.\nAction Initial Cash Flow CF at Time T\nBuy asset; pay carrying costs at T 2P0 PT 2 C\nBorrow P 0; repay with interest at time TP 0 2P0(1 1 r f)\nShort futures position 0 F0 2 P T\n TOTAL 0 F0 2 P 0(1 1 r f) 2 C\nBecause market prices should not allow for arbitrage opportunities, the terminal cash flow \nof this zero-net-investment, risk-free strategy should be zero. \n If the cash flow were positive, this strategy would yield guaranteed profits for no invest-\nment. If the cash flow were negative, the reverse of this strategy also would yield profits. In practice, the reverse strategy would involve a short sale of the commodity. This is unusual but may be done as long as the short sale contract appropriately accounts for storage costs. Thus,  \n9   we conclude that     \nF0 5 P 0 (1 1 r f ) 1 C \nFinally, if we define  c \u00a0 5 \u00a0 C / P  0 , and interpret  c  as the percentage \u201crate\u201d of carrying costs, \nwe may write   \n F 0 5 P 0 (1 1 r f 1 c  )  (23.3)  \nwhich is a (1-year) parity relationship for futures involving storage costs. Compare \nEquation 23.3 to the parity relation for stocks, Equation 22.1 from the previous chapter, and you will see that they are extremely similar. In fact, if we think of carrying costs as a \u201cnega-tive dividend,\u201d the equations are identical. This result makes intuitive sense because, instead of receiving a dividend yield of  d,  the storer of the commodity must pay a storage cost of  c.  \nObviously, this parity relationship is simply an extension of those we have seen already.    23.5 Commodity Futures Pricing  \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   822bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   822 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 23 Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management 823\n Although we have called  c  the carrying cost of \nthe commodity, we may interpret it more gener-\nally as the  net  carrying cost, that is, the carrying \ncost net of the benefits derived from holding the \ncommodity in inventory. For example, part of the \n\u201cconvenience yield\u201d of goods held in inventory \nis the protection against stocking out, which may \nresult in lost production or sales. \n It is vital to note that we derive Equation 23.3 \nassuming that the asset will be bought and stored; \nit therefore applies only to goods that currently \n are  being stored. Two kinds of commodities \ncannot be expected to be stored. The first kind \nis commodities for which storage is technologi-\ncally not feasible, such as electricity. The second \nincludes goods that are not stored for economic \nreasons. For example, it would be foolish to buy \nan agricultural commodity now, planning to store \nit for ultimate use in 3 years. Instead, it is clearly \npreferable to delay the purchase until after the \nharvest of the third year, and avoid paying stor-\nage costs. Moreover, if the crop in the third year \nis comparable to this year\u2019s, you could obtain it \nat roughly the same price as you would pay this \nyear. By waiting to purchase, you avoid both interest and storage costs. \n Because storage across harvests is costly, Equation 23.3 should not be expected to apply \nfor holding periods that span harvest times, nor should it apply to perishable goods that are \navailable only \u201cin season.\u201d Whereas the futures price for gold, which is a stored commodity, \nincreases steadily with the maturity of the contract, the futures price for wheat is seasonal; \nits futures price typically falls across harvests between March and July as new supplies \nbecome available. \n  Figure\u00a023.9  is a stylized version of the seasonal price pattern for an agricultural product. \nClearly this pattern differs from financial assets such as stocks or gold for which there is \nno seasonal price movement. Financial assets are priced so that holding them in portfo-\nlio produces a fair expected return. Agricultural prices, in contrast, are subject to steep \nperiodic drops as each crop is harvested, which makes storage across harvests generally \nunprofitable.  \n Futures pricing across seasons therefore requires a different approach that is not based \non storage across harvest periods. In place of general no-arbitrage restrictions we rely \ninstead on risk premium theory and discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.   \n Figure 23.9 Typical agricultural price pattern over \nthe season. Prices adjusted for inflation.  \nPrice\nTime\nFirst\nHarvestSecond\nHarvestThird\nHarvest\n People are willing to buy and \u201cstore\u201d shares of stock despite the fact that their purchase ties up capital. \nMost people, however, are not willing to buy and store soybeans.

If the T-bill rate \nis currently 5% and the historical market risk premium is about 8%, the appropriate discount rate for orange juice would be given by the CAPM as   \n5% 1 .117 3 8% 5 5.94% \nIf the expected spot price for orange juice 6 months from now is $1.45 per pound, the present value of a 6-month deferred claim to a pound of orange juice is simply   \n$1.45 / (1.0594)\n1/ 2 5 $1.409  \n What would the proper futures price for orange juice be? The contract calls for the \nultimate exchange of orange juice for the futures price. We have just shown that \nthe present value of the juice is $1.409. This should equal the present value of the futures price that will be paid for the juice. A commitment to a payment of  F  \n0  dollars in \n6 months has a present value of  F  0  /(1.05) 1/2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.976\u00a0 3 \u00a0 F  0 . (Note that the discount rate is \nthe risk-free rate of 5%, because the promised payment is fixed and therefore indepen-\ndent of market conditions.) \n To equate the present values of the promised payment of  F  0  and the promised receipt \nof orange juice, we would set   \n.976F 0 5 $1.409 \nor  F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1.444.

We simply calculate the appropri-ate risk premium from a model such as the CAPM or APT and discount the expected spot price at the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate, as illustrated in the following example. \n \n The general rule, then, to determine the appropriate futures price is to equate the present \nvalue of the future payment of  F  0  and the present value of the commodity to be received. \nThis implies   \nF0\n(11rf)T5E(PT)\n(11k)T \nor   \n F05E(PT)\u00a211rf\n11k\u2264T\n  (23.4)  \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   824bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   824 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 23 Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management 825\n Table 23.3 \n Commodity betas Commodity Beta Commodity Beta\nWheat 20.370 Orange juice     0.117\nCorn 20.429 Propane 23.851\nOats    0.000 Cocoa 20.291\nSoybeans 20.266 Silver 20.272\nSoybean oil 20.650 Copper     0.005\nSoybean meal    0.239 Cattle     0.365\nBroilers 21.692 Hogs 20.148\nPlywood       0.660 Pork bellies 20.062\nPotatoes 20.610 Egg 20.293\nPlatinum    0.221 Lumber 20.131\nWool    0.307 Sugar 22.403\nCotton 20.015\n Source: Zvi Bodie and Victor Rosansky, \u201cRisk and Return in Commodity Futures,\u201d  Financial Analysts \nJournal   36 (May\u2013June 1980).

Foreign exchange futures trade on several foreign currencies, as well as on a European currency \nindex. The interest rate parity relationship for foreign exchange futures is   \nF05E0 \u00a211rUS\n11rforei gn\u2264T\n \n  with exchange rates quoted as dollars per foreign currency.

SUMMARY where  k  is the required rate of return on the commodity, which may be obtained from \na model of asset market equilibrium such as the CAPM. \n Note that Equation 23.4 is perfectly consistent with the spot-futures parity relationship. \nFor example, apply Equation 23.4 to the futures price for a stock paying no dividends. \nBecause the entire return on the stock is in the form of capital gains, the expected rate \nof capital gains must equal  k,  the required rate of return on the stock. Consequently, the \nexpected price of the stock is its current price times (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 k )  T  , or  E ( P   T  )\u00a0 5 \u00a0 P  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 k )  T  . \nSubstituting this expression into Equation 23.4 results in  F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 P  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f   )  T  , which is exactly \nthe parity relationship.      \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   825bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   825 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm826 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n    2 .   Futures contracts calling for cash settlement are traded on various stock market indexes. \nThe contracts may be mixed with Treasury bills to construct artificial equity positions, which makes them potentially valuable tools for market timers. Market index contracts are used also by arbitrageurs who attempt to profit from violations of the stock-futures parity rela tionship.  \n    3 .   Hedging requires investors to purchase assets that will offset the sensitivity of their portfolios to particular sources of risk. A hedged position requires that the hedging vehicle provide profits that vary inversely with the value of the position to be protected.  \n    4 .   The hedge ratio is the number of hedging vehicles such as futures contracts required to offset the risk of the unprotected position. The hedge ratio for systematic market risk is proportional to the size and beta of the underlying stock portfolio. The hedge ratio for fixed-income portfolios is proportional to the price value of a basis point, which in turn is proportional to modified dura-tion and the size of the portfolio.  \n    5 .   Many investors such as hedge funds use hedging strategies to create market-neutral bets on per-ceived instances of relative mispricing between two or more securities. They are not arbitrage strategies, but pure plays on a particular perceived profit opportunity.  \n    6 .   Interest rate futures contracts may be written on the  prices  of debt securities (as in the case \nof Treasury-bond futures contracts) or on interest rates directly (as in the case of Eurodollar contracts).  \n    7 .   Swaps, which call for the exchange of a series of cash flows, may be viewed as portfolios of forward contracts. Each transaction may be viewed as a separate forward agreement. However, instead of pricing each exchange independently, the swap sets one \u201cforward price\u201d that applies to all of the transactions. Therefore, the swap price will be an average of the forward prices that would prevail if each exchange were priced separately.  \n    8 .   Commodity futures pricing is complicated by costs for storage of the underlying commodity. When the asset is willingly stored by investors, the storage costs net of convenience yield enter the futures pricing equation as follows:   \nF\n0 5 P 0 (1 1 r f 1 c)T \n  The non\u2013interest net carrying costs,  c,  play the role of a \u201cnegative dividend\u201d in this context.  \n    9 .

Are there any differences in the calculations \nnecessary to formulate a hedge position in each market?    \n    2. A U.S. exporting firm may use foreign exchange futures to hedge its exposure to exchange \nrate risk. Its position in futures will depend in part on anticipated payments from its customers denominated in foreign currency. In general, however, should its position in futures be more or less than the number of contracts necessary to hedge these anticipated cash flows? What other considerations might enter into the hedging strategy?  \n   3. Both gold-mining firms and oil-producing firms might choose to use futures to hedge uncertainty \nin future revenues due to price fluctuations. But trading activity sharply tails off for maturities beyond 1 year. Suppose a firm wishes to use available (short maturity) contracts to hedge commodity prices at a more distant horizon, say, 4 years from now. Do you think the hedge will be more effective for the oil- or the gold-producing firm?  \n   4. You believe that the spread between municipal bond yields and U.S. Treasury bond yields \nis going to narrow in the coming month. How can you profit from such a change using the municipal bond and T-bond futures contracts?     \n    5. Consider the futures contract written on the S&P 500 index and maturing in 6 months. The \ninterest rate is 3% per 6-month period, and the future value of dividends expected to be paid over the next 6 months is $15. The current index level is 1,425.

What is the theoretical no-arbitrage price for a 6-month futures contract on the S&P 500 stock \nindex?  \n    c .  Suppose the futures price is 1,422. Is there an arbitrage opportunity here? If so, how would \nyou exploit it?     \n   6. Suppose that the value of the S&P 500 stock index is 1,600.\n     a .  If each futures contract costs $25 to trade with a discount broker, how much is the transaction \ncost per dollar of stock controlled by the futures contract?  \n    b .  If the average price of a share on the NYSE is about $40, how much is the transaction cost per \n\u201ctypical share\u201d controlled by one futures contract?  \n    c .  For small investors, a typical transaction cost per share in stocks directly is about 10 cents per \nshare. How many times the transactions costs in futures markets is this?     \n   7.

Instead, you decide to temporarily hedge your equity holdings with S&P \n500 index futures contracts.\n     a.  Should you be long or short the contracts? Why?  \n    b .  If your equity holdings are invested in a market-index fund, into how many contracts should \nyou enter? The S&P 500 index is now at 1,650 and the contract multiplier is $250.  \n    c .  How does your answer to ( b ) change if the beta of your portfolio is .6?     \n   8. A manager is holding a $1 million stock portfolio with a beta of 1.25. She would like to hedge \nthe risk of the portfolio using the S&P 500 stock index futures contract. How many dollars\u2019 \nworth of the index should she sell in the futures market to minimize the volatility of her position?  \n   9.

If a futures contract on the computer industry is traded, how would you hedge the \nexposure to the systematic and industry factors affecting the performance of IBM stock? How \nmany dollars\u2019 worth of the market and industry index contracts would you buy or sell for each dollar held in IBM?  \n   10. Suppose that the spot price of the euro is currently $1.30. The 1-year futures price is $1.35. \nIs the interest rate higher in the United States or the euro zone?  \n   11.     a.   The spot price of the British pound is currently $2.00. If the risk-free interest rate on 1-year \ngovernment bonds is 4% in the United States and 6% in the United Kingdom, what must be the forward price of the pound for delivery 1 year from now?  \n    b.  How could an investor make risk-free arbitrage profits if the forward price were higher than \nthe price you gave in answer to ( a )? Give a numerical example.     \n   12.

Farmer Brown grows Number 1 red corn and would like to hedge the value of the coming har-\nvest. However, the futures contract is traded on the Number 2 yellow grade of corn. Suppose that yellow corn typically sells for 90% of the price of red corn. If he grows 100,000 bushels, and each futures contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, how many contracts should Farmer Brown buy or sell to hedge his position?  \n   14. Return to  Figure\u00a023.7 . Suppose the LIBOR rate when the first listed Eurodollar contract matures \nin January is .40%. What will be the profit or loss to each side of the Eurodollar contract?  \n   15. Yields on short-term bonds tend to be more volatile than yields on long-term bonds. Suppose \nthat you have estimated that the yield on 20-year bonds changes by 10 basis points for every 15-basis-point move in the yield on 5-year bonds. You hold a $1 million portfolio of 5-year maturity bonds with modified duration 4 years and desire to hedge your interest rate exposure with T-bond futures, which currently have modified duration 9 years and sell at  F  \n0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$95.

A corporation plans to issue $10 million of 10-year bonds in 3 months. At current yields \nthe bonds would have modified duration of 8 years. The T-note futures contract is selling at \n F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0100 and has modified duration of 6 years. How can the firm use this futures contract to \nhedge the risk surrounding the yield at which it will be able to sell its bonds? Both the bond and \nthe contract are at par value.  \n   18. If the spot price of gold is $1,500 per troy ounce, the risk-free interest rate is 2%, and stor-\nage and insurance costs are zero, what should be the forward price of gold for delivery in 1 year? Use an arbitrage argument to prove your answer. Include a numerical example show-ing how you could make risk-free arbitrage profits if the forward price exceeded its upper bound value.  \n   19. If the corn harvest today is poor, would you expect this fact to have any effect on today\u2019s futures \nprices for corn to be delivered (postharvest) 2 years from today? Under what circumstances will there be no effect?  \n   20. Suppose that the price of corn is risky, with a beta of .5. The monthly storage cost is $.03, and \nthe current spot price is $5.50, with an expected spot price in 3 months of $5.88. If the expected rate of return on the market is 0.9% per month, with a risk-free rate of 0.5% per month, would you store corn for 3 months?  \n   21. Suppose the U.S. yield curve is flat at 4% and the euro yield curve is flat at 3%. The current \nexchange rate is $1.50 per euro. What will be the swap rate on an agreement to exchange cur-rency over a 3-year period? The swap will call for the exchange of 1 million euros for a given number of dollars in each year.  \n   22. Desert Trading Company has issued $100 million worth of long-term bonds at a fixed rate of \n7%. The firm then enters into an interest rate swap where it pays LIBOR and receives a fixed 6% on notional principal of $100 million. What is the firm\u2019s overall cost of funds?  \n   23. Firm ABC enters a 5-year swap with firm XYZ to pay LIBOR in return for a fixed 6% rate \non notional principal of $10 million. Two years from now, the market rate on 3-year swaps is LIBOR for 5%; at this time, firm XYZ goes bankrupt and defaults on its swap obligation.\n     a.  Why is firm ABC harmed by the default?  \n    b.  What is the market value of the loss incurred by ABC as a result of the default?  \n    c.  Suppose instead that ABC had gone bankrupt. How do you think the swap would be treated \nin the reorganization of the firm?     \n   24. Suppose that at the present time, one can enter 5-year swaps that exchange LIBOR for 8%. \nAn  off-market swap  would then be defined as a swap of LIBOR for a fixed rate other than \n8%. For example, a firm with 10% coupon debt outstanding might like to convert to synthetic floating-rate debt by entering a swap in which it pays LIBOR and receives a fixed rate of 10%. What up-front payment will be required to induce a counterparty to take the other side of this swap? Assume notional principal is $10 million.     \n    25. Suppose the 1-year futures price on a stock-index portfolio is 1,624, the stock index currently is \n1,600, the 1-year risk-free interest rate is 3%, and the year-end dividend that will be paid on a $1,600 investment in the market index portfolio is $20.\n     a.  By how much is the contract mispriced?  \n    b.  Formulate a zero-net-investment arbitrage portfolio and show that you can lock in riskless \nprofits equal to the futures mispricing.  \n    c.  Now assume (as is true for small investors) that if you short sell the stocks in the market \nindex, the proceeds of the short sale are kept with the broker, and you do not receive any interest income on the funds. Is there still an arbitrage opportunity (assuming that you don\u2019t already own the shares in the index)? Explain.  \n    d.  Given the short-sale rules, what is the no-arbitrage  band  for the stock-futures price relation-\nship? That is, given a stock index of 1,600, how high and how low can the futures price be without giving rise to arbitrage opportunities?     \nChallenge\nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   829bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   829 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm830 PART VI  Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\n   26. Consider these futures market data for the June delivery S&P 500 contract, exactly 6 months \nhence. The S&P 500 index is at 1,350, and the June maturity contract is at  F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a01,351.\n     a.  If the current interest rate is 2.2% semiannually, and the average dividend rate of the stocks \nin the index is 1.2% semiannually, what fraction of the proceeds of stock short sales would \nneed to be available to you to earn arbitrage profits?  \n    b.  Suppose that you in fact have access to 90% of the proceeds from a short sale. What is the \nlower bound on the futures price that rules out arbitrage opportunities? By how much does \nthe actual futures price fall below the no-arbitrage bound? Formulate the appropriate arbi-\ntrage strategy, and calculate the profits to that strategy.        \n    1. Donna Doni, CFA, wants to explore potential inefficiencies in the futures market. The TOBEC \nstock index has a spot value of 185. TOBEC futures contracts are settled in cash and underlying \ncontract values are determined by multiplying $100 times the index value. The current annual \nrisk-free interest rate is 6.0%.\n     a.  Calculate the theoretical price of the futures contract expiring 6 months from now, using the \ncost-of-carry model. The index pays no dividends. \n   The total (round-trip) transaction cost for trading a futures contract is $15.  \n    b.  Calculate the lower bound for the price of the futures contract expiring 6 months from now.     \n   2. Suppose your client says, \u201cI am invested in Japanese stocks but want to eliminate my exposure \nto this market for a period of time. Can I accomplish this without the cost and inconvenience of \nselling out and buying back in again if my expectations change?\u201d\n     a.  Briefly describe a strategy to hedge both the local market risk and the currency risk of \ninvesting in Japanese stocks.  \n    b.  Briefly explain why the hedge strategy you described in part ( a ) might not be fully effective.     \n   3. Ren\u00e9 Michaels, CFA, plans to invest $1 million in U.S. government cash equivalents for the next \n90 days. Michaels\u2019s client has authorized her to use non\u2013U.S. government cash equivalents, but \nonly if the currency risk is hedged to U.S. dollars by using forward currency contracts.\n     a.  Calculate the U.S. dollar value of the hedged investment at the end of 90 days for each of the \ntwo cash equivalents in the table below. Show all calculations.  \n    b.

After studying Iris Hamson\u2019s credit analysis, George Davies is considering whether he can \nincrease the holding-period return on Yucatan Resort\u2019s excess cash holdings (which are held in \npesos) by investing those cash holdings in the Mexican bond market. Although Davies would \nbe investing in a peso-denominated bond, the investment goal is to achieve the highest holding-\nperiod return, measured in U.S. dollars, on the investment. \nbod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   830bod61671_ch23_799-834.indd   830 7/25/13   2:01 AM7/25/13   2:01 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 23 Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management 831\n Davies finds the higher yield on the Mexican 1-year bond, which is considered to be free \nof credit risk, to be attractive, but he is concerned that depreciation of the peso will reduce the \nholding-period return, measured in U.S. dollars. Hamson has prepared the following selected financial data to help Davies make the decision: \nSelected Economic and Financial Data\nU.S. 1-year Treasury bond yield 2.5%\nMexican 1-year bond yield 6.5%\nNominal Exchange Rates\nSpot 9.5000 Pesos 5 U.S. $1.00\n1-year forward 9.8707 Pesos 5 U.S. $1.00\n Hamson recommends buying the Mexican 1-year bond and hedging the foreign currency expo-sure using the 1-year forward exchange rate. Calculate the U.S. dollar holding-period return that would result from the transaction recommended by Hamson. Is the U.S. dollar holding-period return resulting from the transaction more or less than that available in the U.S.?  \n   5 .      a.   Pamela Itsuji, a currency trader for a Japanese bank, is evaluating the price of a 6-month \nJapanese yen/U.S. dollar currency futures contract. She gathers the following currency and interest rate data: \nJapanese yen/U.S. dollar spot currency exchange rate \u00a5124.30/$1.00\n6-month Japanese interest rate      0.10%\n6-month U.S. interest rate      3.80%\n   Calculate the theoretical price for a 6-month Japanese yen/U.S. dollar currency futures contract, \nusing the data above.  \n    b.  Itsuji is also reviewing the price of a 3-month Japanese yen/U.S. dollar currency futures con-\ntract, using the currency and interest rate data shown below. Because the 3-month Japanese \ninterest rate has just increased to .50%, Itsuji recognizes that an arbitrage opportunity exists and decides to borrow $1 million U.S. dollars to purchase Japanese yen. Calculate the yen arbitrage profit from Itsuji\u2019s strategy, using the following data:  \nJapanese yen/U.S. dollar spot currency exchange rate \u00a5124.30/$1.00\nNew 3-month Japanese interest rate     0.50%\n3-month U.S. interest rate     3.50%\n3-month currency futures contract value \u00a5123.2605/$1.00\n   6. Janice Delsing, a U.S.-based portfolio manager, manages an $800 million portfolio ($600 million \nin stocks and $200 million in bonds).

Because the firm does poorly when the dollar depreciates, it hedges with a futures contract that \nwill provide profits in that scenario. It needs to enter a  long  position in pound futures, which \nmeans that it will earn profits on the contract when the futures price increases, that is, when more \ndollars are required to purchase one pound. The specific hedge ratio is determined by noting that if the number of dollars required to buy one pound rises by $.05, profits decrease by $200,000 at the same time that the profit on a long future contract would increase by $.05\u00a0 3 \u00a062,500\u00a0 5 \u00a0$3,125. \nThe hedge ratio is   \n$200,000 per $.05 depreciation in the dollar\n$3,125 per contract per $.05 depreciation564 contracts long   \n   3.

The manager would like to hold on to the money market securities because of their attractive rela-\ntive pricing compared to other short-term assets. However, there is an expectation that rates will fall. The manager can hold this  particular  portfolio of short-term assets and still benefit from the \ndrop in interest rates by entering a swap to pay a short-term interest rate and receive a fixed inter-est rate. The resulting synthetic fixed-rate portfolio will increase in value if rates do fall.  \n   8. Stocks offer a total return (capital gain plus dividends) large enough to compensate investors for \nthe time value of the money tied up in the stock. Agricultural prices do not necessarily increase over time. In fact, across a harvest, crop prices will fall. The returns necessary to make storage economically attractive are lacking.  \n   9. If systematic risk were higher, the appropriate discount rate,  k,  would increase. Referring to \nEquation 23.4, we conclude that  F  \n0  would fall. Intuitively, the claim to 1 pound of orange juice \nis worth less today if its expected price is unchanged, while the risk associated with the value of that claim increases.

Efficient allocation therefore depends on the quality of these profes-sionals and the propensity of financial mar-kets to direct capital to the best stewards. Therefore, if capital markets are to be rea-sonably efficient, investors must be able to measure the performance of their asset managers. And such measurement must be sufficiently accurate to allow a proper rank ordering of their ability. At a minimum, effi-ciency demands that performance evaluation be accurate enough to distinguish managers who (net of fees) are inferior to a randomly chosen, diversified portfolio. Thus, the social benefit of a reasonably reliable performance evaluation method is as large as that of mar-ket efficiency. \n  How can we  evaluate the performance of \na portfolio manager? It turns out that even \nan average portfolio return is not as straight-forward to measure as it might seem. In addition, adjusting average returns for risk presents a host of other problems. In the end, performance evaluation is far from trivial. \n We begin with the measurement of port-\nfolio returns. From there we move on to con-\nventional approaches to risk adjustment. We identify the problems with these approaches when applied in various real-life situations. We then turn to some practical procedures for performance evaluation in the field such as style analysis, the Morningstar Star Ratings, and in-house performance attribution.   PART VII  Portfolio Performance \nEvaluation  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR \n    24.1 The Conventional Theory of Performance \nEvaluation \n   Average Rates of Return \n We defined the holding-period return (HPR) in Section 5.1 of Chapter 5 and explained \nthe differences between arithmetic and geometric averages. Suppose we evaluate the per-formance of a portfolio over a period of 5 years from 20 quarterly rates of return. The arithmetic average of this sample of returns would be the best estimate of the expected \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   835bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   835 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n836 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nrate of return of the portfolio for the next quarter. In contrast, the geometric average is the \nconstant quarterly return over the 20 quarters that would yield the same total cumulative return. Therefore, the geometric average,  r  \n G  , is defined by\n   (11rG)205(11r1)(11r2) c (11r20)  \n The right-hand side of this equation is the compounded final value of a $1 investment earn-\ning the 20 quarterly rates of return over the 5-year observation period. The left-hand side is the compounded value of a $1 investment earning  r  \n G    each  quarter. We solve for 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   G   as  1   \n   11rG53(11r1)(11r2) c (11r20)41/20  \n Each return has an equal weight in the geometric average. For this reason, the geometric \naverage is referred to as a    time-weighted average    .  \n To set the stage for discussing the more subtle issues that follow, let us start with a \ntrivial example. Consider a stock paying a dividend of $2 annually that currently sells for $50. You purchase the stock today, collect the $2 dividend, and then sell the stock for $53 at year-end. Your rate of return is\n   Total proceeds\nInitial in vestment5Income 1Capital gain\n505213\n505.10, or 10%   \n Another way to derive the rate of return that is useful in the more difficult multiperiod \ncase is to set up the investment as a discounted cash flow problem. Call  r  the rate of return \nthat equates the present value of all cash flows from the investment with the initial outlay. In our example the stock is purchased for $50 and generates cash flows at year-end of $2 (dividend) plus $53 (sale of stock). Therefore, we solve 50\u00a0 5 \u00a0(2\u00a0 1 \u00a053)/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r ) to find \nagain that  r \u00a0 5 \u00a010%.  \n  Time-Weighted Returns versus Dollar-Weighted Returns \n When we consider investments over a period during which cash was added to or with-drawn from the portfolio, measuring the rate of return becomes more difficult. To continue our example, suppose that you were to purchase a second share of the same stock at the end of the first year, and hold both shares until the end of year 2, at which point you sell each share for $54. \n Total cash outlays are  \n  Time    Outlay  \n 0  $50 to purchase first share \n 1  $53 to purchase second share a year later \n    Proceeds  \n 1  $2 dividend from initially purchased share \n 2  $4 dividend from the 2 shares held in the second year, plus \n   $108 received from selling both shares at $54 each \n  1 This formula gives the geometric average as a quarterly rate of return, consistent with the quarterly rates used to \ncompute it. When the observation period is of length  h  years (1/4 in this example), the  annualized  compounded \nrate is defined by 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   GA  \u00a0 5 \u00a0(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   Gh  ) 1/ h  .

It is \u201cdollar weighted\u201d because the stock\u2019s performance in the second year, \nwhen two shares of stock are held, has a greater influence on the average overall return than the first-year return, when only one share is held. \n The time-weighted (geometric average) return is 7.81%:\n   r\n155312250\n505.10510%   \u00a0r255412253\n535.056655.66%\nrG5(1.1031.0566 )1/2215.078157.81%  \n The dollar-weighted average is less than the time-weighted average in this example because \nthe return in the second year, when more money was invested, is lower.   \n Shares of XYZ Corp. pay a $2 dividend at the end of every year on December 31. An investor buys two \nshares of the stock on January 1 at a price of $20 each, sells one of those shares for $22 a year later on the next January 1, and sells the second share an additional year later for $19. Find the dollar- and time-weighted rates of return on the 2-year investment.  CONCEPT CHECK 24.1 \n  Dollar-Weighted Return and Investment Performance \n Every household faces several daunting saving goals, for example, the education of chil-\ndren and retirement. Many of these goals allow for tax-sheltered savings, for example, IRAs or 401(k) plans for retirement and 529 plans for college expenses. These accounts are, by their nature, separated from other household assets. \n Households have considerable latitude in choices of investment venues and will want to \ncheck results from time to time. How should they do this? The answer here is quite simple. First, the household must maintain a spreadsheet of time-dated cash inflows and outflows. It is a simple task to record the current value of the investment account. In this setting, the dollar-weighted average over any investment period will yield the effective rate of return earned for the period.  \n2    \n To guarantee that you can accomplish this important task, be sure to solve Problem 1 at \nthe end of the chapter. See also the nearby Excel Application box.   \n  Adjusting Returns for Risk \n Evaluating performance based on average return alone is not very useful. Returns must be adjusted for risk before they can be compared meaningfully. The simplest and most popu-lar way to adjust returns for portfolio risk is to compare rates of return with those of other investment funds with similar risk characteristics. For example, high-yield bond portfolios \n  2 Excel\u2019s function XIRR allows you to input sums at any date. The function provides the IRR between any two \ndates given a starting value, cash flows at various dates in between (with additions given as negative numbers, and \nwithdrawals as positive values), and a final value on the closing date. \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   837bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   837 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n838are grouped into one \u201cuniverse,\u201d growth stock equity funds are grouped into another uni-\nverse, and so on. Then the (usually time-weighted) average returns of each fund within the universe are ordered, and each portfolio manager receives a percentile ranking depending on relative performance with the    comparison universe    .  For example, the manager with \nthe ninth-best performance in a universe of 100 funds would be the 90th percentile man-ager: Her performance was better than 90% of all competing funds over the evaluation period.  \n3   The nearby box reports on Vanguard\u2019s recent revamp of its benchmark indexes for \nseveral asset classes.   \n These relative rankings are usually displayed in a chart such as that in  Figure\u00a024.1 . The \nchart summarizes performance rankings over four periods: 1 quarter, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years. The top and bottom lines of each box are drawn at the rate of return of the 95th and 5th percentile managers. The three dashed lines correspond to the rates of return of the 75th, 50th (median), and 25th percentile managers. The diamond is drawn at the average return of a particular fund and the square is drawn at the return of a benchmark index such as the S&P 500. The placement of the diamond within the box is an easy-to-read represen-tation of the performance of the fund relative to the comparison universe.  \n This comparison of performance with other managers of similar investment style is a use-\nful first step in evaluating performance. However, such rankings can be misleading.

For this purpose we looked at the distribution of alpha values for samples of mutual funds. We noted that any conclusion from such samples was subject to error due to survivorship bias if funds that failed during the sample period were excluded from the sample. In this chapter, we are interested in how to assess the performance of individual funds (or other portfolios) of interest. When a particular portfolio is chosen today for inspection of its returns going forward, survivorship bias is not an issue. However, comparison groups must be free of survivorship bias. A sample comprised only of surviving funds will bias the return of the benchmark group upward and the  relative  performance of any particular fund \ndownward. \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   838bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   838 7/31/13   6:26 PM7/31/13   6:26 PMFinal PDF to printer\n839portfolio characteristics are not truly compa-\nrable. For example, within the equity universe, \none manager may concentrate on high-beta or \naggressive growth stocks. Similarly, within \nfixed-income universes, durations can vary \nacross managers. These considerations suggest \nthat a more precise means for risk adjustment \nis desirable. \n Methods of risk-adjusted performance evalu-\nation using mean-variance criteria came on \nstage simultaneously with the capital asset \npricing model. Jack Treynor,  4   William Sharpe,  5   \nand Michael Jensen  6   recognized immediately \nthe implications of the CAPM for rating the \nperformance of managers. Within a short time, \nacademicians were in command of a battery of \nperformance measures, and a bounty of schol-\narly investigation of mutual fund performance \nwas pouring from ivory towers. Shortly thereaf-\nter, agents emerged who were willing to supply \nrating services to portfolio managers and their \nclients.   Vanguard to Change Target Benchmarks for 22 Index Funds \n Vanguard plans to transition six international stock index \nfunds to FTSE benchmarks and 16 U.S. stock and balanced \nindex funds to new benchmarks developed by the Uni-\nversity of Chicago\u2019s Center for Research in Security Prices \n(CRSP). The transition from the current MSCI benchmarks \nfor the 22 funds is expected to result in considerable sav-\nings for the funds\u2019 shareholders over time. \n \u201cThe indexes from FTSE and CRSP are well constructed, \noffer comprehensive coverage of their respective markets, and \nmeet Vanguard\u2019s \u2018best practice\u2019 standards for market bench-\nmarks,\u201d said Vanguard Chief Investment Officer Gus Sauter. \n\u201cEqually important, and with our clients\u2019 best interests in mind, \nwe negotiated licensing agreements for these benchmarks \nthat we expect will enable us to deliver significant value to our \nindex fund and ETF shareholders and lower expense ratios over \ntime.\u201d In an environment in which index licensing fees, in gen-\neral, have represented a growing portion of the expenses that \ninvestors pay to own index funds and ETFs, Mr. Sauter noted \nthat the long-term agreements with FTSE and CRSP will provide \ncost certainty going forward with these two index providers. \n In 2009, CRSP engaged with Vanguard to create a new \nseries of investable indexes, the CRSP Indexes. Vanguard will \nbe the first investment management firm to track CRSP\u2019s broadly diversified benchmarks that cover the broad U.S. \nmarket, market capitalization segments, and styles. CRSP\u2019s \ncapitalization-weighted methodology introduces the unique \nconcept of \u201cpacketing,\u201d which cushions the movement of \nstocks between adjacent indexes and allows holdings to be \nshared between two indexes of the same family. This approach \nmaximizes style purity while minimizing index turnover. \n Sixteen Vanguard stock and balanced index funds, with \naggregate assets of $367 billion, will track CRSP bench-\nmarks, including Vanguard\u2019s largest index fund, the $197 \nbillion Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. The fund \nand its ETF Shares (ticker: VTI) will transition from the MSCI \nU.S. Broad Market Index to the CRSP US Total Market Index. \n The benchmark changes will encompass all share classes \nof the 22 funds, including ETFs. The transitions will be stag-\ngered and are expected to occur collectively over a num-\nber of months. No changes are planned for Vanguard U.S. \nstock index funds seeking to track Russell and Standard & \nPoor\u2019s benchmarks, or the 11 Vanguard sector equity funds \ncurrently seeking to track MSCI benchmarks. \nSource:  October 2, 2012 \u00a9 The Vanguard Group, Inc., used with \npermission.

Moreover, their reliability requires quite a long history of consistent management \nwith a steady level of performance and a representative sample of investment environ-ments: bull as well as bear markets. \n We start by cataloging some possible risk-adjusted performance measures for a portfo-\nlio,  P,  and examine the circumstances in which each measure might be most relevant. \n    1 .   Sharpe ratio:     (r\nP2rf)/sP  \n      Sharpe\u2019s ratio    divides average portfolio excess return over the sample period by the standard deviation of returns over that period. It measures the reward to (total) volatility trade-off.  \n7     \n   2.  Treynor measure:     (rP2rf)/bP  \n   Like the Sharpe ratio,    Treynor\u2019s measure    gives excess return per unit of risk, but it \nuses systematic risk instead of total risk.  \n   3.  Jensen\u2019s alpha:     a P5rP23rf1bP (rM2rf)4  \n      Jensen\u2019s alpha    is the average return on the portfolio over and above that predicted by the CAPM, given the portfolio\u2019s beta and the average market return.  \n8    \n   4.  Information ratio:   a   P  / s ( e   P  ) \n   The    information ratio    divides the alpha of the portfolio by the nonsystematic risk \nof the portfolio, called \u201ctracking error\u201d in the industry. It measures abnormal return \nper unit of risk that in principle could be diversified away by holding a market index portfolio.  \n   5.  Morningstar risk-adjusted return:     MRAR (g)5B1\nTaT\nt51\u00a211rt\n11rft\u22642g\nR12\ng\n21  \n   The Morningstar rating is a sort of harmonic average of excess returns, where \n t \u00a0 5 \u00a01,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0,  T  are monthly observations,  9   and  g  measures risk aversion. Higher  g  \nmeans greater punishment for risk. For mutual funds, Morningstar uses  g \u00a0 5 \u00a02, \nwhich is considered a reasonable coefficient for an average retail client.  10   MRAR \ncan be interpreted as the risk-free equivalent excess return of the portfolio for an \ninvestor with risk aversion measured by  g .   \n Each performance measure has some appeal. But each does not necessarily provide \nconsistent assessments of performance, because the risk measures used to adjust returns differ substantially.   \n  7 We place bars over  r   f   as well as  r   P   to denote the fact that because the risk-free rate may not be constant over the \nmeasurement period, we are taking a sample average, just as we do for  r   P  . Equivalently, we may simply compute \nsample average  excess  returns. \n  8 In many cases performance evaluation assumes a multifactor market. For example, when the Fama-French \n3- factor model is used, Jensen\u2019s alpha will be:    aP5rP2rf2bPM (rM2rf)2sPrSMB2hPrHML  where  s   P   is the \nloading on the SMB portfolio and  h   P   is the loading on the HML portfolio. A multifactor version of the Treynor \nmeasure also exists. See footnote 13. \n  9 The fraction (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   t  )/(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   ft  ) is well approximated by 1 plus the excess return,  R   t  . \n  10 The MRAR measure is the  certainty-equivalent geometric average excess return  derived from a more sophis-\nticated utility function than the mean-variance function we used in Chapter 6. The utility function is called  con-\nstant relative risk aversion (CRRA).  When investors have CRRA, their capital allocation (the fraction of the \nportfolio placed in risk-free versus risky assets) does not change with wealth. The coefficient of risk aversion is:  A \u00a0 5 \u00a01\u00a0 1 \u00a0 g . When  g \u00a0 5 \u00a00 (equivalently,  A \u00a0 5 \u00a01), the utility function is just the geometric average of gross excess \nreturns:\nMRAR(0)5cqT\nt51(11Rt)d12\nT21\n   \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   840bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   840 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation 841\n  The  M  2  Measure of Performance \n While the Sharpe ratio can be used to rank portfolio performance, its numerical value is \nnot easy to interpret. Comparing the ratios for portfolios  M  and  P  in Concept Check 2, \nyou should have found that  S   P  \u00a0 5 \u00a0.69 and  S   M  \u00a0 5 \u00a0.73. This suggests that portfolio  P  under-\nperformed the market index. But is a difference of .04 in the Sharpe ratio economically \nmeaningful? We often compare rates of return, but these pure numbers are difficult to interpret. \n An equivalent representation of Sharpe\u2019s ratio was proposed by Graham and Harvey, \nand later popularized by Leah Modigliani of Morgan Stanley and her grandfather Franco Modigliani, past winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics.  \n11   Their approach has been \ndubbed the  M  2  measure (for Modigliani-squared). Like the Sharpe ratio,  M  2  focuses on \ntotal volatility as a measure of risk, but its risk adjustment leads to an easy-to-interpret dif-ferential return relative to the benchmark index.  \n To compute  M  \n2 , we imagine that a managed portfolio,  P,  is mixed with a position in \nT-bills so that the complete, or \u201cadjusted,\u201d portfolio matches the volatility of a market index such as the S&P 500. If the managed portfolio has 1.5 times the standard deviation of the index, the adjusted portfolio would be two-thirds invested in the managed portfolio and one-third in bills. The adjusted portfolio, which we call  P *, would then have the same \nstandard deviation as the index. (If the managed portfolio had  lower  standard deviation \nthan the index, it would be leveraged by borrowing money and investing the proceeds in the portfolio.) Because the market index and portfolio  P * have the same standard devia-\ntion, we may compare their performance simply by comparing returns. This is the  M  \n2  \nmeasure for portfolio  P: \n    MP25rP*2rM  (24.1)       Consider the following data for a particular sample period: \n    Portfolio   P    Market   M  \n Average return    35%    28% \n Beta  1.20  1.00 \n Standard deviation    42%    30% \n Tracking error \n(nonsystematic risk),  s (e)    18%    0 \n Calculate the following performance measures for portfolio  P  and the market: Sharpe, Jensen (alpha), \nTreynor, information ratio.

She makes no changes in portfolio composition during the period. In addition, sup-\npose that the daily rates of return on all securities have constant means, variances, and \ncovariances. These assumptions are unrealistic, and the need for them highlights the short-\ncoming of conventional applications of performance measurement. \n Now we want to evaluate the performance of Jane\u2019s portfolio.

Second, in choosing between two dis-\ntinct alternative portfolios, what are the appropriate criteria to evaluate \nperformance? Finally, the performance criteria having been identified, \nis there a rule that will separate basic ability from the random luck of \nthe draw? \n Earlier chapters of this text help to determine portfolio choice cri-\nteria. If investor preferences can be summarized by a mean-variance \nutility function such as that introduced in Chapter 6, we can arrive at \na relatively simple criterion. The particular utility function that we \nused is\nU 5 E(rP) 2    1\u20442AsP2  \n where  A  is the coefficient of risk aversion. With mean-variance pref-\nerences, Jane wants to maximize the Sharpe ratio [ E ( r   P  )\u00a0  2 \u00a0 r   f  ]/ s   P  . \nRecall that this criterion led to the selection of the tangency portfolio in \n Chapter 7. Jane\u2019s problem reduces to the search for the portfolio with \nthe highest possible Sharpe ratio.   Using the data of Concept Check 2,  P  has a standard deviation of 42% versus a market \nstandard deviation of 30%. Therefore, the adjusted portfolio  P * would be formed by \nmixing bills and portfolio  P  with weights 30/42\u00a0 5 \u00a0.714 in  P  and 1\u00a0 2 \u00a0.714\u00a0 5 \u00a0.286 in bills. \nThe return on this portfolio would be (.286\u00a0 3 \u00a06%)\u00a0 1 \u00a0(.714\u00a0 3 \u00a035%)\u00a0 5 \u00a026.7%, which is \n1.3% less than the market return. Thus portfolio  P  has an    M2\nP  measure of  2 1.3%. \n A graphical representation of  M  2  appears in  Figure\u00a024.2 . We move down the capital \nallocation line corresponding to portfolio  P  (by mixing  P  with T-bills) until we reduce the \nstandard deviation of the adjusted portfolio to match that of the market index.    M2\nP  is then \nthe vertical distance (the difference in expected returns) between portfolios  P * and  M.  \nYou can see from  Figure\u00a024.2  that  P  will have a negative  M  2  when its capital allocation \nline is less steep than the capital market line, that is, when its Sharpe ratio is less than \nthat of the market index.  12     Example 24.1  M  2  Measure \n12  M  2  is positive when the portfolio\u2019s Sharpe ratio exceeds the market\u2019s. Letting  R  denote excess returns and \nS  denote Sharpe measures, the geometry of  Figure\u00a024.2  implies that  R   P * \u00a0 5 \u00a0 S   P   s   M  , and therefore that\n   M25rp*2rM5Rp*2RM5SPsM2SMsM5(SP2SM)sM  \nM  2  and the Sharpe ratio will therefore rank order portfolios identically. \n Figure 24.2  M  2  of portfolio  P   \nE(r)\nCAL( P)CML\nP*PM\nFM2\n\u03c3M\u03c3P\u03c3 \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   842bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   842 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation 843\n  Appropriate Performance Measures in Two Scenarios \n To evaluate Jane\u2019s portfolio choice, we first ask whether this portfolio is her exclusive \ninvestment vehicle. If the answer is no, we need to know her \u201ccomplementary\u201d port-\nfolio. The appropriate measure of portfolio performance depends critically on whether \nthe portfolio is the entire investment fund or only a portion of the investor\u2019s overall \nwealth. \n  Jane\u2019s Portfolio Represents Her Entire Risky Investment Fund   In this \nsimplest case we need to ascertain only whether Jane\u2019s portfolio has the highest Sharpe \nmeasure. We can proceed in three steps:\n    1. Assume that past security performance is representative of expected performance, \nmeaning that realized security returns over Jane\u2019s holding period exhibit averages \nand covariances similar to those that Jane had anticipated.  \n   2. Determine the benchmark (alternative) portfolio that Jane would have held if she \nhad chosen a passive strategy, such as the S&P 500.  \n   3. Compare Jane\u2019s Sharpe measure or  M  2  to that of the best portfolio.    \n In sum, when Jane\u2019s portfolio represents her entire investment fund, the benchmark is \nthe market index or another specific portfolio. The performance criterion is the Sharpe \nmeasure of the actual portfolio versus the benchmark.  \n  Jane\u2019s Choice Portfolio Is One of Many Portfolios Combined into a \nLarge Investment Fund   This case might describe a situation where Jane, as a cor-\nporate financial officer, manages the corporate pension fund. She parcels out the entire \nfund to a number of portfolio managers. Then she evaluates the performance of individual \nmanagers to reallocate the fund to improve future performance. What is the correct perfor-\nmance measure? \n The Sharpe ratio is based on average excess return (the reward) against total SD \n(total portfolio risk). It measures the slope of the CAL. However, when Jane employs \na number of managers, nonsystematic risk will be largely diversified away, so system-\natic risk becomes the relevant measure of risk. The appropriate performance metric is \nnow Treynor\u2019s, which takes the ratio of average excess return to beta (because systematic \nSD\u00a0 5 \u00a0 b \u00a0 3 \u00a0market SD). \n Consider portfolios  P  and  Q  in  Table\u00a024.1  and the graph in  Figure\u00a024.3 . We plot  P  and \n Q  in the expected return\u2013beta (rather than the expected return\u2013standard deviation) plane, \nbecause we assume that  P  and  Q  are two of many subportfolios in the fund, and thus that \n Table 24.1 \n Portfolio performance     Portfolio   P    Portfolio   Q    Market  \n Beta   .90   1.60   1.0 \n Excess return    ( r2rf)   11%  19%  10% \n Alpha*   2%   3%   0 \n *   Alpha 5 Excess return 2 (Beta 3 Market excess return)\n5 (r 2 rf ) 2 b(rM 2 rf ) 5 r 2 [r f 1 b(rM 2 rf )] \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   843bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   843 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n8 4 4 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nnonsystematic risk will be largely diversified \naway. The security market line (SML) shows \nthe value of  a   P   and  a   Q   as the distance of  P\nand  Q  above the SML.   \n If we invest  w   Q   in  Q  and  w   F  \u00a0 5 \u00a01\u00a0 2 \u00a0 w   Q   in \nT-bills, the resulting portfolio,  Q *, will have \nalpha and beta values proportional to  Q \u2019s \nalpha and beta scaled down by  w   Q  :\n    aQ*5wQaQ\n bQ*5wQbQ  \n Thus all portfolios such as  Q *, generated \nby mixing  Q  with T-bills, plot on a straight \nline from the origin through  Q.  We call it the \nT-line for the Treynor measure, which is the \nslope of this line. \n  Figure\u00a0 24.3  shows the  T -line for portfo-\nlio  P  as well.  P  has a steeper  T -line; despite \nits lower alpha,  P  is a better portfolio after \nall. For any  given   beta, a mixture of  P  with \nT-bills will give a better alpha than a mixture \nof  Q  with T-bills.  \n  Figure 24.3 Treynor\u2019s measure  \n.9 1.0 1.619\n16\n11\n10\n9Q\nSMLTp Line\nTQ LineExcess Return (%)\nr \u2212 rf\nP\nM\n\u03b2 \u03b1Q = 3%\n\u03b1p = 2%\n Suppose we choose to mix  Q  with T-bills to create a portfolio  Q * with a beta equal to \nthat of  P.

The slope for  P,  denoted by  T   P  , is given by\n   TP5rP2rf\nbP  \n Like  M  2 , Treynor\u2019s measure is a percentage. If you subtract the market excess return \nfrom Treynor\u2019s measure, you will obtain the difference between the return on the  T   P   line \nin  Figure\u00a024.3  and the SML, at the point where  b \u00a0 5 \u00a01. We might dub this difference  T2 , \nanalogous to  M  2 . Be aware though that  M  2  and  T  2  are as different as Sharpe\u2019s measure is \nfrom Treynor\u2019s measure. They may well rank portfolios differently.    \n  The Role of Alpha in Performance Measures \n With some algebra we can derive the relationship between the three performance measures \ndiscussed so far. The following table shows these relationships.  \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   844bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   844 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n845    Treynor (  T   p   )    Sharpe* (  S   p   )  \n Relation to alpha \n    E(rp)2rf\nbp5ap\nbp1TM      E(rp)2rf\nsp5ap\nsp1rSM  \n Deviation from market performance     Tp25Tp2TM5ap\nbp              Sp2SM5ap\nsp 2 (1 2 r)SM\n  * r  denotes the correlation coefficient between portfolio  P  and the market, and is less than 1.  \n All of these measures are consistent in that superior performance requires a positive \nalpha. Hence, alpha is the most widely used performance measure. However, positive \nalpha alone cannot guarantee a better Sharpe ratio for a portfolio. Taking advantage of mispricing means departing from full diversification, which entails a cost in terms of non-systematic risk. A mutual fund can achieve a positive alpha, yet, at the same time, increase its SD enough that its Sharpe ratio will actually fall.  \n13     \n  13 With a multifactor model, alpha must be adjusted for the additional factors. When you have  K  factors, \n k \u00a0 5 \u00a01,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0,\u00a0 K  (the first of which,  k \u00a0 5 \u00a01, is the market index  M ), a portfolio  P \u2019s average realized excess return \nis given by:    RP5aP1aK\nk51bPkRk,  where    Rk  is the average return on the zero-investment factor portfolio, or \nthe average excess rate when the direct factor growth rate is used. Hence, the generalization of Jensen\u2019s \nalpha is    a PK5aP2aK\nk52bPkRk.  The generalized Treynor measure that accounts for all  K  factors is given by: \n   GTP5aPK akbkMRk\nakbPkRk,  where  b   kM   is the beta of factor  k  on the index  M,  and  b   Pk   is the beta of  P  on factor  k.  [This \nmeasure was developed by Georges Hubner (HEC School of Management, yet unpublished]). Notice that with \njust one factor, the alpha reduces to the original Jensen\u2019s alpha and GT to the single-index Treynor measure.  eXcel APPLICATIONS:    Performance Measurement \n  T he following performance measurement spreadsheet \ncomputes all the performance measures discussed \nin this section.

Table\u00a024.2  shows the excess return recorded each \nmonth for Jane\u2019s portfolio  P,  one of her alternative portfolios  Q,  and the benchmark index \nportfolio  M.  The last rows in  Table\u00a024.2  give sample average and standard deviations. From \nthese, and regressions of  P  and  Q  on  M,  we obtain the necessary performance statistics.  \n The performance statistics in  Table\u00a024.3  show that portfolio  Q  is more aggressive than\u00a0 P,\nin the sense that its beta is significantly higher (1.40 vs. .70). At the same time, from its \nresidual standard deviation,  P  is better diversified (2.02% vs. 9.81%). Both portfolios out-\nperformed the benchmark market index, as is evident from their larger Sharpe ratios (and \nthus positive  M  2 ), their positive alphas, and better Morningstar RAR.  \n  Month    Jane\u2019s Portfolio   P    Alternative   Q    Benchmark   M  \n  1   3.58%   2.81%   2.20% \n  2   2 4.91    2 1.15   2 8.41 \n  3   6.51    2.53   3.27 \n  4  11.13  37.09   14.41 \n  5   8.78  12.88   7.71 \n  6   9.38  39.08   14.36 \n  7   2 3.66   2 8.84   2 6.15 \n  8   5.56   0.83   2.74 \n  9   2 7.72  0.85   2 15.27 \n 10   7.76  12.09   6.49 \n 11   2 4.01   2 5.68   2 3.13 \n 12  0.78   2 1.77   1.41 \n  Average     2.77   7.56   1.64 \n  Standard deviation     6.45  15.55   8.84  Table 24.2 \n Excess returns for port-\nfolios  P  and  Q  and the \nbenchmark  M  over \n12 months \n    Portfolio   P    Portfolio   Q    Portfolio   M  \n Sharpe ratio  0.43  0.49  0.19 \n  M  2   2.16  2.66  0.00 \n Morningstar RAR  0.30  0.80  0.07 \n  SCL regression statistics         \n Alpha  1.63  5.26  0.00 \n Beta  0.70  1.40  1.00 \n Treynor  3.97  5.38  1.64 \n  T  2   2.34  3.74  0.00 \n  s ( e )  2.02  9.81  0.00 \n Information ratio  0.81  0.54  0.00 \n R-SQR  0.91  0.64  1.00  Table 24.3 \n Performance statistics \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   846bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   846 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation 847\n Which portfolio is more attractive based on reported performance? If  P  or  Q  represents \nthe entire investment fund,  Q  would be preferable on the basis of its higher Sharpe measure \n(.49 vs. .43) and better  M  2  (2.66% vs. 2.16%). For the second scenario, where  P  and  Q  are \ncompeting for a role as one of a number of subportfolios,  Q  also dominates because its \nTreynor measure is higher (5.38 vs. 3.97). However, as an active portfolio to be mixed with \nthe index portfolio,  P  is preferred because its information ratio (IR\u00a0 5 \u00a0 a / s ( e )) is larger \n(.81 vs. .54), as discussed in Chapter 8 and restated in the next section. Thus, the example illustrates that the right way to evaluate a portfolio depends in large part on how the port-folio fits into the investor\u2019s overall wealth. \n This analysis is based on 12 months of data only, a period too short to lend statistical \nsignificance to the conclusions. Even longer observation intervals may not be enough to make the decision clear-cut, which represents a further problem. A model that calculates these performance measures is available on the Online Learning Center  (   www.mhhe.\ncom/bkm   ).    \n  Performance Manipulation and the Morningstar \nRisk-Adjusted Rating \n Performance evaluation so far has been based on this assumption: Rates of return in each \nperiod are independent and drawn from the same distribution; in statistical jargon, returns are independent and identically distributed. This assumption can crumble in an insidi-ous way when managers, whose compensation depends on performance, try to game the system. They may employ strategies designed to improve  measured  performance even \nif they harm investors. Managers\u2019 compensation may then lose its anchor to beneficial performance. \n Managers can affect performance measures over a given evaluation period because they \nobserve how returns unfold over the course of the period and can adjust portfolios accord-ingly. Once they do so, rates of return in the later part of the evaluation period come to depend on rates in the beginning of the period. \n Ingersoll, Spiegel, Goetzmann, and Welch  \n14   show how all but one of the performance \nmeasures covered in this chapter can be manipulated. The sole exception is the Morningstar RAR, which is in fact a manipulation-proof performance measure (MPPM). While the details of their model are challenging, the logic is straightforward, as we now illustrate using the Sharpe ratio.  \n As we saw when analyzing capital allocation (Chapter 6), investment in the risk-free \nasset (lending or borrowing) will not affect the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio. Put differently, the Sharpe ratio is invariant to the fraction  y  in the risky portfolio (leverage occurs when \n y \u00a0.\u00a01). The reason is that excess returns are proportional to  y  and therefore so are both the \nrisk premium and SD, leaving the Sharpe ratio unchanged. But what if  y  is changed during \na period? If the decision to change leverage in mid-stream is made before any performance \nis observed, then again, the Sharpe measure will not be affected because rates in the two portions of the period will still be uncorrelated. \n But imagine a manager already partway into an evaluation period. While realized excess \nreturns (average return, SD, and Sharpe ratio) are now known for the first part of the evalu-ation period, the distribution of the remaining future rates is still the same as before. The overall Sharpe ratio will be some (complicated) average of the known Sharpe ratio in the first leg and the yet unknown ratio in the second leg of the evaluation period. Increasing leverage during the second leg will increase the weight of that performance in the average \n  14 Jonathan Ingersoll, Matthew Spiegel, William Goetzmann, and Ivo Welch, \u201cPortfolio Performance Manipula-\ntion and Manipulation Proof Performance Measures,\u201d  Review of Financial Studies  20 (2007). \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   847bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   847 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n848 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nbecause leverage will amplify returns, both good and bad. Therefore, managers will wish \nto increase leverage in the latter part of the period if early returns are poor.  15   Conversely, \ngood first-part performance calls for deleveraging to increase the weight on the initial period. With an extremely good first leg, a manager will shift almost the entire portfolio to the risk-free asset. This strategy induces a (negative) correlation between returns in the first and second legs of the evaluation period.  \n Investors lose, on average, from this strategy. Arbitrary variation in leverage (and there-\nfore risk) is utility-reducing. It benefits managers only because it allows them to adjust the weighting scheme of the two subperiods over the full evaluation/compensation period after observing their initial performance.  \n16   Hence investors would like to prohibit or at \nleast eliminate the incentive to pursue this strategy. Unfortunately, only one performance measure is impossible to manipulate. \n A manipulation-proof performance measure (MPPM) must fulfill four requirements:\n    1. The measure should produce a single-value score to rank a portfolio.  \n   2. The score should not depend on the dollar value of the portfolio.     3. An uninformed investor should not expect to improve the expected score by \ndeviating from the benchmark portfolio.  \n   4. The measure should be consistent with standard financial market equilibrium \nconditions.    \n Ingersoll et al. prove that the Morningstar RAR fulfills these requirements and is in fact \na manipulation-proof performance measure (MPPM). Interestingly, Morningstar was not aiming at an MPPM when it developed the MRAR\u2014it was simply attempting to accom-modate investors with constant relative risk aversion. \n Panel A of  Figure\u00a024.4  shows a scatter of Sharpe ratios vs. MRAR of 100 portfolios \nbased on statistical simulation. Thirty-six excess returns were randomly generated for each portfolio, all with an annual expected return of 7% and SDs varying from 10% to 30%. Thus the true Sharpe ratios of these simulated \u201cmutual funds\u201d are in the range of 0.7 to 0.23, with a mean of .39. Because of sampling variation, the actual 100 Sharpe ratios in the simulation differ quite a bit from these population parameters; they range from  2 1.02 to \n2.46 and average .32. The 100 MRARs range from  2 28% to 37% and average 0.7%. The \ncorrelation between the measures was .94, suggesting that Sharpe ratios track MRAR quite well. Indeed the scatter is pretty tight along a line with a slope of 0.19.  \n Panel B of  Figure\u00a024.4  (drawn on the same scale as panel A) illustrates the effect of \nmanipulation when one leverage change is allowed after initial performance is observed, specifically in the middle of the 36-month evaluation period.  \n17   The effect of manipulation \nis evident from the extreme-value portfolios. For high-positive initial MRARs, the switch toward risk-free investments preserves the first-half high Sharpe ratios that might other-wise be diluted or possibly even reversed in the second half. For the high-negative initial MRARs, when leverage ratios are increased, we see two effects. First, MRARs look worse because of cases where the high leverage backfired and worsened the MRARs compared to panel A (points move to the left). In contrast, Sharpe ratios look better than in panel A \n  15 Managers who are precluded from increasing leverage will instead shift to high-beta stocks. If this is a wide-\nspread phenomenon, it could help explain why high-beta stocks appear, on average, to be overpriced relative to \nlow-beta ones. \n  16 One way to reduce the potency of manipulation is to evaluate performance more frequently. This will reduce the \nstatistical precision of the measure, however.   \n17 To keep the exercise realistic, leverage ratios were capped at 2 (a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0). \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   848bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   848 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation 849\n Figure 24.4 MRAR scores and Sharpe ratios with and without manipulation   \n\u22121.5\u22121\u22120.500.511.522.5\n\u22120.5 \u22120.4 \u22120.3 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 \u22120.2 \u22120.1A: No manipulation: Sharpe vs. MRAR\nMRARSharpe RatioAverage Sharpe Ratio               .32\nSD                                               .66\nAverage MRAR                          .077%\nSD                                               .13 \nSlope of Sharpe on MRAR        .19\nR-Square                                    .90\nCorrelation between Halves     .14\nB: Manipulation: Sharpe vs. MRAR\n\u20131.5\u20131\u20130.50.511.522.53\n\u20130.5 \u20130.4 \u20130.3 0.1 0.3 \u20130.2 \u20130.1 0 0.2 0.4\nMRARSharpe RatioAverage Sharpe Ratio                .40\nSD                                                .66\nAverage MRAR                       \u20132.74%\nSD                                                .18\nSlope of Sharpe on MRAR         .25\nR-Square                                     .84\nCorrelation between Halves    \u2013.06\n0\n(they move upward).

As predicted, the correlation between average returns in \nthe first and second legs of the period changes from positive to negative. All this happened because of an average increase in leverage from 1.0 to 1.39.  \n18    \n Morningstar introduced the MRAR in 2002. It is particularly relevant to hedge funds, \nwhere managers have great latitude and incentive to manipulate. See Chapter 26 for further discussion. Given its immunity to manipulation, we would expect the MRAR measure to become a standard performance statistic sometime in the future, required especially of managers who have the most discretion over investment policy.  \n  Realized Returns versus Expected Returns \n When evaluating a portfolio, the evaluator knows neither the portfolio manager\u2019s original expectations nor whether those expectations made sense. One can only observe perfor-mance after the fact and hope that random results are neither taken for, nor hide, true under-lying ability. But risky asset returns are \u201cnoisy,\u201d which complicates the inference problem. To avoid making mistakes, we have to determine the \u201csignificance level\u201d of a performance measure to know whether it reliably indicates ability. \n Consider Joe Dart, a portfolio manager. Suppose that his portfolio has an alpha of 20 \nbasis points per month, which makes for a hefty 2.4% per year before compounding. Let us assume that the return distribution of Joe\u2019s portfolio has constant mean, beta, and alpha, a heroic assumption, but one that is in line with the usual treatment of performance measure-ment. Suppose that for the measurement period Joe\u2019s portfolio beta is 1.2 and the monthly standard deviation of the residual (nonsystematic risk) is .02 (2%). With a market index stan-dard deviation of 6.5% per month (22.5% per year), Joe\u2019s portfolio systematic variance is\n   b\n2sM251.2236.52560.84  \n and hence the correlation coefficient between his portfolio and the market index is\n   r5Bb2sM2\nb2sM21s2(e)R1/2\n5c60.84\n60.8414d1/2\n5.97  \n which shows that his portfolio is quite well diversified. \n To estimate Joe\u2019s portfolio alpha from the security characteristic line (SCL), we regress \nthe portfolio excess returns on the market index. Suppose that we are in luck and the regres-\nsion estimates yield precisely the true parameters. That means that our SCL estimates for the  N  months are\n   a^5.2%, \u00a0\u00a0b^51.2, \u00a0\u00a0s^(e)52%  \n The evaluator who runs such a regression, however, does not know the true values, and hence must compute the  t -statistic of the alpha estimate to determine whether to reject the \nhypothesis that Joe\u2019s alpha is zero, that is, that he has no superior ability. \n The standard error of the alpha estimate in the SCL regression is approximately\n   s^(a)5s^(e)\n\"N  \n where  N  is the number of observations and    s^(e)  is the sample estimate of nonsystematic \nrisk. The  t -statistic for the alpha estimate is then\n    t(a^)5a^\ns^(a)5a^\"N\ns^(e)  (24.2)   \n  18 Out of 100 funds, the leverage ratio was decreased in 38 portfolios, was increased to less than 2 in 14 portfolios, \nand was increased to 2 (and would have been increased even more absent the cap) in 48 portfolios. \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   850bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   850 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation 851\n Suppose an analyst has a measured alpha of .2% with a standard error of 2%, as in our example. What is \nthe probability that the positive alpha is due to luck of the draw and that true ability is zero?  CONCEPT CHECK 24.3  Suppose that we require a significance level of 5%. This requires a    t(a^)  value of 1.96 if  N  \nis large. With    a ^5.2  and    s ^(e)52,  we solve Equation 24.2 for  N  and find that\n    1 . 9 65.2\"N\n2\n N5384 months  \n or 32 years! \n What have we shown? Here is an analyst who has very substantial ability. The example \nis biased in his favor in the sense that we have assumed away statistical complications. \nNothing changes in the parameters over a long period of time. Furthermore, the sample period \u201cbehaves\u201d perfectly. Regression estimates are all perfect. Still, it will take Joe\u2019s entire working career to get to the point where statistics will confirm his true ability. We have to conclude that the problem of statistical inference makes performance evaluation extremely difficult in practice. \n Now add to the imprecision of performance estimates the fact that the average tenure of \na fund manager is only about 4.5 years. By the time you are lucky enough to find a fund whose historic superior performance you are confident of, its manager is likely to be about to move, or has already moved elsewhere. The nearby box explores this topic further.     \n   24.2 Performance Measurement for Hedge Funds \n  In describing Jane\u2019s portfolio performance evaluation we left out one scenario that may well be relevant. \n Suppose Jane has been satisfied with her well-diversified mutual fund, but now she \nstumbles upon information on hedge funds. Hedge funds are rarely designed as candidates for an investor\u2019s overall portfolio. Rather than focusing on Sharpe ratios, which would entail establishing an attractive trade-off between expected return and overall volatility, these funds tend to concentrate on opportunities offered by temporarily mispriced securi-ties, and show far less concern for broad diversification. In other words, these funds are  alpha driven,  and best thought of as possible  additions  to core positions in more traditional \nportfolios established with concerns of diversification in mind. \n In Chapter 8, we considered precisely the question of how best to mix an actively man-\naged portfolio with a broadly diversified core position. We saw that the key statistic for \nthis mixture is the information ratio of the actively managed portfolio; this ratio, therefore, becomes the active fund\u2019s appropriate performance measure. \n To briefly review, call the active portfolio established by the hedge fund  H,  and the \ninvestor\u2019s baseline passive portfolio  M.  Then the optimal position of  H  in the overall port-\nfolio, denoted  P *, would be\n    w\nH5wH0\n11(12bH)wH0 ; wH05aH\ns2(eH)\nE(RM)\nsM2  (24.3)   \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   851bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   851 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n852 As we saw in Chapter 8, when the hedge fund is optimally combined with the baseline \nportfolio using Equation 24.3, the improvement in the Sharpe measure will be determined by its information ratio  a  \n H  / s ( e   H  ), according to\n    SP*25SM21BaH\ns(eH)R2\n  (24.4)   \n Equation 24.4 tells us that the appropriate performance measure for the hedge fund is its \ninformation ratio (IR).  \n Looking back at  Table\u00a024.3 , we can calculate the IR of portfolios  P  and  Q  as\n    I RP5aP\ns(eP)51.63\n2.025.81; IR Q55.38\n9.815.54  (24.5)   \n If we were to interpret  P  and  Q  as hedge funds, the low beta of  P,  .70, could result \nfrom short positions the fund holds in some assets. The relatively high beta of  Q,  1.40, \nmight result from leverage that would also increase the firm-specific risk of the fund,  s ( e  \n Q  ). Using these calculations, Jane would favor hedge fund  P  with the higher infor-\nmation ratio.   Should You Follow Your Fund Manager? \n The whole idea of investing in a mutual fund is to leave \nthe stock and bond picking to the professionals. But fre-quently, events don\u2019t turn out quite as expected\u2014the manager resigns, gets transferred or dies. A big part of the investor\u2019s decision to buy a managed fund is based on the manager\u2019s record, so changes like these can come as an unsettling surprise. \n There are no rules about what happens in the wake of \na manager\u2019s departure. It turns out, however, that there \nis strong evidence to suggest that the managers\u2019 real con-tribution to fund performance is highly overrated. For example, research company Morningstar compared funds that experienced management changes between 1990 and 1995 with those that kept the same managers. In the five years ending in June 2000, the top-performing funds of the previous five years tended to keep beating their peers\u2014despite losing any fund managers. Those funds that per-formed badly in the first half of the 1990s continued to do badly, regardless of management changes. While mutual fund management companies will undoubtedly continue to create star managers and tout their past records, inves-tors should stay focused on fund performance. \n Funds are promoted on their managers\u2019 track records, \nwhich normally span a three- to five-year period. But per-\nformance data that goes back only a few years is hardly a valid measure of talent. To be statistically sound, evidence of a manager\u2019s track record needs to span, at a minimum, 10 years or more. \n The mutual fund industry may look like a merry-go-\nround of managers, but that shouldn\u2019t worry most inves-\ntors. Many mutual funds are designed to go through little or no change when a manager leaves. That is because, according to a strategy designed to reduce volatility and succession worries, mutual funds are managed by teams of stock pickers, who each run a portion of the assets, rather than by a solo manager with co-captains. Meanwhile, even so-called star managers are nearly always surrounded by researchers and analysts, who can play as much of a role in performance as the manager who gets the headlines. \n Don\u2019t forget that if a manager does leave, the invest-\nment is still there. The holdings in the fund haven\u2019t \nchanged. It is not the same as a chief executive leaving a company whose share price subsequently falls. The best thing to do is to monitor the fund more closely to be on top of any changes that hurt its fundamental investment qualities. \n In addition, don\u2019t underestimate the breadth and depth \nof a fund company\u2019s \u201cmanagerial bench.\u201d The larger, \nestablished investment companies generally have a large pool of talent to draw on. They are also well aware that investors are prone to depart from a fund when a manage-rial change occurs. \n Lastly, for investors who worry about management \nchanges, there is a solution: index funds. These mutual \nfunds buy stocks and bonds that track a benchmark index like the S&P 500 rather than relying on star managers to actively pick securities. In this case, it doesn\u2019t really matter if the manager leaves. At the same time, index investors don\u2019t have to pay tax bills that come from switching out of funds when managers leave. Most importantly, index fund investors are not charged the steep fees that are needed to pay star management salaries. \n Source: Shauna Carther, \u201cShould You Follow Your Fund \n Manager?\u201d   Investopedia.com   ,  March 3, 2010.

We will \ndiscuss many of these in Chapter 26, which is devoted to these funds. But for now we can \nbriefly mention a few of the difficulties:\n    1. The risk profile of hedge funds (both total volatility and exposure to relevant \n systematic factors) may change rapidly. Hedge funds have far greater leeway than mutual funds to change investment strategy opportunistically. This instability makes it hard to measure exposure at any given time.  \n   2. Hedge funds tend to invest in illiquid assets. We therefore must disentangle liquidity \npremiums from true alpha to properly assess their performance. Moreover, it can be difficult to accurately price inactively traded assets, and correspondingly difficult to measure rates of return.  \n   3. Many hedge funds pursue strategies that may provide apparent profits over long \nperiods of time, but expose the fund to infrequent but severe losses. Therefore, very long time periods may be required to formulate a realistic picture of their true risk\u2013return trade-off.  \n   4. Hedge funds have ample latitude to change their risk profiles and therefore consid-\nerable ability to manipulate conventional performance measures. Only the MRAR is manipulation-proof, and investors should urge these funds to use them.  \n   5. When hedge funds are evaluated as a group, survivorship bias can be a major \n consideration, because turnover in this industry is far higher than for investment companies such as mutual funds.    \n The nearby box discusses some of the misuses of conventional performance measures \nin evaluating hedge funds.    Sharpe Point: Risk Gauge is Misused \n William F. Sharpe was probably the biggest expert in the \nroom when economists from around the world gathered to hash out a pressing problem: How to gauge hedge-fund risk. About 40 years ago, Dr. Sharpe created a simple cal-culation for measuring the return that investors should expect for the level of volatility they are accepting. In other words: How much money do they stand to make compared with the size of the up-and-down swings they will lose sleep over? \n The so-called Sharpe ratio became a cornerstone of \nmodern finance, as investors used it to help select money \nmanagers and mutual funds. But the use of the ratio has been criticized by many prominent academics\u2014including Dr. Sharpe himself. \n The ratio is commonly used\u2014\u201cmisused,\u201d Dr. Sharpe \nsays\u2014for promotional purposes by hedge funds. Hedge \nfunds, loosely regulated private investment pools, often use complex strategies that are vulnerable to surprise events and elude any simple formula for measuring risk. \u201cPast average experience may be a terrible predictor of future performance,\u201d Dr. Sharpe says. \n Dr. Sharpe designed the ratio to evaluate portfolios of \nstocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better a fund is expected to perform over the \nlong term. However, at a time when smaller investors and pension funds are pouring money into hedge funds, the ratio can foster a false sense of security. \n Dr. Sharpe says the ratio doesn\u2019t foreshadow hedge-\nfund woes because \u201cno number can.\u201d The formula can\u2019t \npredict such troubles as the inability to sell off investments quickly if they start to head south, nor can it account for extreme unexpected events. Long-Term Capital Manage-ment, a huge hedge fund in Connecticut, had a glowing Sharpe ratio before it abruptly collapsed in 1998 when Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on debt. Plus, hedge funds are generally secretive about their strategies, making it difficult for investors to get an accurate picture of risk. \n Another problem with the Sharpe ratio is that it is \ndesigned to evaluate the risk-reward profile of an inves-\ntor\u2019s entire portfolio, not small pieces of it. This shortcom-ing is particularly telling for hedge funds. \n  Source:  Ianthe Jeanne Dugan, \u201cSharpe Point: Risk Gauge is \n Misused,\u201d  The Wall Street Journal,  August 31, 2005, p.

Imagine how this problem is compounded \nwhen portfolio return distributions are constantly changing. \n It is acceptable to assume that the return distributions of passive strategies have constant \nmean and variance when the measurement interval is not too long. However, under an \nactive strategy return distributions change by design, as the portfolio manager updates the \nportfolio in accordance with the dictates of financial analysis. In such a case, estimating \nvarious statistics from a sample period assuming a constant mean and variance may lead to \nsubstantial errors. Let us look at an example.   \n Suppose that the Sharpe measure of the market index is .4. Over an initial period of \n52\u00a0weeks, the portfolio manager executes a low-risk strategy with an annualized mean \nexcess return of 1% and standard deviation of 2%. This makes for a Sharpe measure of \n.5, which beats the passive strategy. Over the next 52-week period this manager finds \nthat a  high -risk strategy is optimal, with an annual mean excess return of 9% and stan-\ndard deviation of 18%. Here, again, the Sharpe measure is .5. Over the 2-year period \nour manager maintains a better-than-passive Sharpe measure. \n  Figure\u00a024.5  shows a pattern of (annualized) quarterly returns that are consistent with \nour description of the manager\u2019s strategy of 2 years. In the first four quarters the excess \nreturns are  2 1%,\u00a0 3%,\u00a0  2 1%, and 3%, making for an average of 1% and standard \ndeviation of 2%. In the next four quarters the returns are  2 9%,\u00a027%,\u00a0 2 9%,\u00a027%, \nmaking for an average of 9% and standard deviation of 18%. Thus  both  years exhibit a \nSharpe measure of .5. However, over the eight-quarter sequence the mean and standard \ndeviation are 5% and 13.42%, respectively, making for a Sharpe measure of only .37, \napparently inferior to the passive strategy!  Example 24.3 Changing Portfolio Risk \n What happened in Example 24.3? The \nshift of the mean from the first four quar-\nters to the next was not recognized as a \nshift in strategy. Instead, the difference \nin mean returns in the 2 years added to \nthe  appearance   of volatility in portfolio \nreturns. The active strategy with shift-\ning means appears riskier than it really \nis and biases the estimate of the Sharpe \nmeasure downward. We conclude that for \nactively managed portfolios it is helpful \nto keep track of portfolio composition and \nchanges in portfolio mean and risk. We \nwill see another example of this problem \nin the next section, which deals with mar-\nket timing.   \nRate of Return (%)\nQuarter27\n3\n\u22121\n\u22129\n Figure 24.5 Portfolio returns.

In practice, most managers do not shift fully between T-bills and the market. How can we account for partial shifts into the market when it is expected to perform well? \n To simplify, suppose that an investor holds only the market-index portfolio and T-bills. \nIf the weight of the market were constant, say, .6, then portfolio beta would also be con-stant, and the SCL would plot as a straight line with slope .6, as in  Figure\u00a024.6, panel A . If, however, the investor could correctly time the market and shift funds into it in periods when the market does well, the SCL would plot as in  Figure\u00a024.6, panel B . If bull and bear markets can be predicted, the investor will shift more into the market when the market is about to go up. The portfolio beta and the slope of the SCL will be higher when  r  \n M   is \nhigher, resulting in the curved line that appears in  Figure\u00a024.6, panel B .  \n Treynor and Mazuy were the first to propose estimating such a line by adding a squared \nterm to the usual linear index model:  19   \n   rP2rf5a1b(rM2rf)1c(rM2rf)21eP  \n where  r    P   is the portfolio return, and  a,   b,  and  c  are estimated by regression analysis. \nIf  c  turns out to be positive, we have evidence of timing ability, because this last term will \nmake the characteristic line steeper as  r   M  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 r   f   is larger. Treynor and Mazuy estimated this \nequation for a number of mutual funds, but found little evidence of timing ability. \n A similar but simpler methodology was proposed by Henriksson and Merton.  20   \nThese authors suggested that the beta of the portfolio take only two values: a large value \nif the market is expected to do well and a small value otherwise. Under this scheme the portfolio characteristic line appears as  Figure\u00a024.6, panel C . Such a line appears in regression form as\n   r\nP2rf5a1b(rM2rf)1c(rM2rf)D1eP  \n where  D  is a dummy variable that equals 1 for  r   M  \u00a0.\u00a0 r   f   and zero otherwise. Hence the beta \nof the portfolio is  b  in bear markets and  b \u00a0 1 \u00a0 c  in bull markets. Again, a positive value of  c  \nimplies market timing ability. \n Henriksson  21   estimated this equation for 116 mutual funds. He found that the average \nvalue of  c  for the funds was  negative,  and equal to 2.07. In sum, the results showed little \nevidence of market timing ability. Perhaps this should be expected; given the tremendous \nvalues to be reaped by a successful market timer, it would be surprising in nearly efficient markets to uncover clear-cut evidence of such skills. \n To illustrate a test for market timing, return to  Table\u00a024.2 .

The results reveal that portfolio  P  shows no timing. It is not \nclear whether this is a result of Jane\u2019s making no attempt at timing or that the effort to time \nthe market was in vain and served only to increase portfolio variance unnecessarily. \n The results for portfolio  Q,  however, reveal that timing has, in all likelihood, success-\nfully been attempted. The timing coefficient,  c,  is estimated at .10.

The important point for \nperformance evaluation, however, is that expanded regressions can capture many of the \neffects of portfolio composition change that would confound the more conventional mean-\nvariance measures.  \n   The Potential Value of Market Timing \n Suppose we define perfect market timing as the ability to tell (with certainty) at the begin-\nning of each year whether the S&P 500 portfolio will outperform the strategy of rolling \nover 1-month T-bills throughout the year. Accordingly, at the beginning of each year, the \nmarket timer shifts all funds into either cash equivalents (T-bills) or equities (the all U.S. \nstock portfolio), whichever is predicted to do better. Beginning with $1 on January 1, 1927, \nhow would the perfect timer end an 86-year experiment on December 31, 2012, in com-\nparison with investors who kept their funds in either equity or T-bills for the entire period? \n  Table\u00a024.4 , columns 1\u20133, presents summary statistics for each of the three passive strat-\negies, computed from the historical annual returns of bills and equities. From the returns \non stocks and bills, we calculate wealth indexes of the all-bills and all-equity investments \nand show terminal values for these investors at the end of 2012. The return for the perfect \ntimer in each year is the  maximum   of the return on stocks and the return on bills.  \n The first row in  Table\u00a024.4  tells all. The terminal value of investing $1 in bills over the \n86 years (1927\u20132012) is $20, while the terminal value of the same initial investment in \nequities is about $2,652. We saw a similar pattern for a 25-year investment in Chapter\u00a05; \nthe much larger terminal values (and difference between them) when extending the hori-\nzon from 25 to 86 years is just another manifestation of the power of compounding. We \nargued in Chapter 5 that as impressive as the difference in terminal values is, it is best \ninterpreted as no more than fair compensation for the risk borne by equity investors. \nNotice that the standard deviation of the all-equity investor was a hefty 20.39%. This is \nalso why the geometric average of stocks for the period is \u201conly\u201d 9.60%, compared with \nthe arithmetic average of 11.63%. (The difference between the two averages increases \nwith volatility.) \n  Strategy    Bills    Equities    Perfect Timer    Imperfect Timer   *   \n  Terminal Value   20  2,652  352,796  8,859 \n  Arithmetic Average   3.59  11.63  16.75  11.98 \n  Standard Deviation   3.12  20.39  13.49  14.36 \n  Geometric Average   3.54  9.60  16.01  11.09 \n  LPSD (relative to bills)   0  21.18  0  17.15 \n  Minimum  \u2020    2 0.04   2 44.00   2 0.02   2 27.09 \n  Maximum   14.72  57.42  57.42  57.42 \n  Skew   0.99   2 0.42  0.72  0.71 \n  Kurtosis   0.98  0.02   2 0.13  1.50 \n Table 24.4 \n Performance of bills, equities, and (annual) timers\u2014perfect and imperfect \n *The imperfect timer has  P  1 \u00a05\u00a0.7, and  P 2\u00a0 5 \u00a0.7.

In fact, this result \nis even better than it looks, because the return to the market timer is truly risk-free. This is the classic case where a large standard deviation (13.49%) has nothing to do with risk. Because the timer never delivers a return below the risk-free rate, the standard deviation is a measure of  good  surprises only. The positive skew of the distribution (compared with the \nnegative skew of equities) is a manifestation of the fact that the extreme values are all positive. Another indication of this stellar performance is the minimum and maximum returns\u2014the minimum return equals the minimum return on bills (in 1940) and the maxi-mum return is that of equities (in 1933)\u2014so that all negative returns on equities (as low as 244% in 1931) were avoided by the timer. Finally, the best indication of the performance of the timer is a lower partial standard deviation, LPSD.  \n22   The LPSD of the all-equity port-\nfolio is only slightly greater than the conventional standard deviation, but it is necessarily zero for the perfect timer.  \n If we interpret the terminal value of the all-equity portfolio in excess of the value of the \nT-bill portfolio entirely as a risk premium commensurate with investment risk, we must conclude that the risk-adjusted equivalent value of the all-equity terminal value is the same as that of the T-bill portfolio, $20.  \n23   In contrast, the perfect timer\u2019s portfolio has no risk, \nand so receives no discount for risk. Hence, it is fair to say that the forecasting ability of the perfect timer converts a $20 final value to a value of $352,796.  \n  Valuing Market Timing as a Call Option \n The key to valuing market timing ability is to recognize that perfect foresight is equivalent to holding a call option on the equity portfolio. The perfect timer invests 100% in either the safe asset or the equity portfolio, whichever will provide the higher return. The rate of return is  at least  the risk-free rate. This is shown in  Figure\u00a024.7 .  \n To see the value of information as an option, suppose that the market index currently \nis at  S  \n0  and that a call option on the index has an exercise price of  X \u00a0 5 \u00a0 S  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  ). If the \nmarket outperforms bills over the coming period,  S   T   will exceed  X,  whereas it will be less \nthan  X  otherwise. Now look at the payoff to a portfolio consisting of this option and  S  0  \ndollars invested in bills:  \n  22 The conventional LPSD is based on the average squared deviation below the mean. Because the threshold \nperformance in this application is the risk-free rate, we modify the LPSD for this discussion by taking squared \ndeviations from that rate and the observations are conditional on being below that threshold. It ignores the num-ber of such events. \n  \n23 It may seem hard to attribute such a big difference in final outcome solely to risk aversion. But think of it \nthis way: the final value of the equity position is 133 times that of the bills position ($2,652 versus $20). Over \n86 years, this implies a reasonable annualized risk premium of 5.85%:\u00a0133 1/86 \u00a0 5 \u00a01.0585. \n  24 The analogy between market timing and call options, and the valuation formulas that follow from it, were devel-\noped in Robert C.

This value would constitute the fair fee that a perfect timer could \ncharge investors for its services. Placing a value on perfect timing also enables us to assign \nvalue to less-than-perfect timers. \n The exercise price of the perfect-timer call option on $1 of the equity portfolio is the \nfinal value of the T-bill investment. Using continuous compounding, this is $1\u00a0 3 \u00a0 e   rT  . When \nyou use this exercise price in the Black-Scholes formula for the value of the call option, the \nformula simplifies considerably to  25   \nMV(Perfect timer per $ of assets )5C52N (\u00bd sM\"T)21  (24.6)   \n We have so far assumed annual forecasts, that is,  T \u00a0 5 \u00a01 year. Using  T \u00a0 5 \u00a01, and the stan-\ndard deviation of stocks from  Table\u00a024.4 , 20.39%, we compute the value of this call option \nas 8.12 cents, or 8.12% of the value of the equity portfolio. This is less than the historical-\naverage return of perfect timing shown in  Table\u00a024.5 , reflecting the fact that actual timing \nvalue is sensitive to fat tails in the distribution of returns, whereas Black-Scholes presumes \na log-normal distribution. \n Equation 24.6 tells us that perfect market timing would be equivalent to enhancing the \nannual equity return by .0812 (or 8.12% per year). Since the average equity return over the \nlast 86 years has been 11.63%, this would be similar in value to enjoying an annual return \nof 1.1162\u00a0 3 \u00a01.0812\u00a0 2 \u00a01\u00a0 5 \u00a0.2069, or 20.69%. \n If a timer could make the correct choice every month instead of every year, the value of \nthe forecasts would dramatically increase. Of course, making perfect forecasts more fre-\nquently requires even better powers of prediction. As the frequency of such perfect predic-\ntions increases without bound, the value of the \nservices will increase without bound as well. \n Suppose the perfect timer could make perfect \nforecasts every month. In this case, each forecast \nwould be for a shorter interval, and the value \nof each individual forecast would be lower, but \nthere would be 12 times as many forecasts, each \nof which could be valued as another call option. \nThe net result is a big increase in total value. \nWith monthly predictions, the value of the call \nwill be 2 N(\u00bd 3 .2039 3 \"1/12) 2 1 5 .0235. \nUsing a monthly T-bill rate of 3.6%/12, the pres-\nent value of a 1-year string of such monthly \ncalls, each worth $.0235, is $.28. Thus, the \nannual value of the monthly perfect timer is \n28 cents on the dollar, compared to 8.12 cents \nfor an annual timer. For an investment period \nof 86 years, the forecast future value of a $1 \ninvestment would be a far greater [(1\u00a0  1 \u00a0 .28)\n(1\u00a0 1 \u00a0.1163)] 86 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2.1\u00a0 3 \u00a010 13 .

But a high success rate for a \u201cstopped-clock\u201d strategy is not evidence of fore-\ncasting ability. Similarly, the appropriate measure of market forecasting ability is not the overall proportion of correct forecasts. If the market is up 2 days out of 3 and a forecaster always predicts market advance, the two-thirds success rate is not a measure of forecasting ability. We need to examine the proportion of bull markets ( r  \n M  \u00a0,\u00a0 r   f  ) correctly forecast  and  \nthe proportion of bear markets ( r   M  \u00a0.\u00a0 r   f  ) correctly forecast. \n If we call  P  1  the proportion of the correct forecasts of bull markets and  P  2  the propor-\ntion for bear markets, then P 1 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 P  2 \u00a0 2 \u00a01 is the correct measure of timing ability. For exam-\nple, a forecaster who always guesses correctly will have  P  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0 P  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a01, and will show ability \nof \u00a0 P  1 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 P  2 \u00a0 2 \u00a01\u00a0 5 \u00a01 (100%).

CONCEPT CHECK 24.4 \n  When timing is imperfect, Merton shows that if we measure overall accuracy by the \nstatistic  P  1 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 P  2 \u00a0 2 \u00a01, the market value of the services of an imperfect timer is simply\n   M V(Imperfect timer )5(P11P221)3C5(P11P221) 32N(\u00bd sM\"T)214  (24.7)   \n The last column in  Table\u00a024.4  provides an assessment of the imperfect market-timer. To \nsimulate the performance of an imperfect timer, we drew random numbers to capture the possibility that the timer will sometimes issue an incorrect forecast (we assumed here both  P  \n1  and  P  2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0.7) and compiled results for the 86 years of history.  26   The statistics of this \nexercise resulted in an average terminal value for the imperfect timer of \u201conly\u201d $8,859, \ncompared with the perfect timer\u2019s $352,796, but still considerably superior to the $2,562 for the all-equity investments.  \n27    \n A further variation on the valuation of market timing is a case in which the timer does \nnot shift fully from one asset to the other. In particular, if the timer knows her forecasts are imperfect, one would not expect her to shift fully between markets. She presumably would moderate her positions. Suppose that she shifts a fraction v of the portfolio between T-bills \nand equities. In that case, Equation 24.7 can be generalized as follows:\n   M V(Imperfect timer )5v(P\n11P221)32N(sM\"T)214  \n If the shift is  v \u00a0 5 \u00a0.50 (50% of the portfolio), the timer\u2019s value will be one-half of the value \nwe would obtain for full shifting, for which  v \u00a0 5 \u00a01.0.    \n  26 In each year, we started with the correct forecast, but then used a random number generator to occasionally \nchange the timer\u2019s forecast to an incorrect prediction. We set the probability that the timer\u2019s forecast would be \ncorrect equal to .70 for both up and down markets.\n  27 Notice that Equation 24.7 implies that an investor with a value of  P \u00a0 5 \u00a00 who attempts to time the market \nwould add zero value. The shifts across markets would be no better than a random decision concerning asset \nallocation.\nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   860bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   860 7/25/13   3:13 AM7/25/13   3:13 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation 861\n   24.5 Style Analysis \nStyle analysis   was introduced by Nobel laureate William Sharpe.  28   The popularity of the \nconcept was aided by a well-known study  29   concluding that 91.5% of the variation in returns \nof 82 mutual funds could be explained by the funds\u2019 asset allocation to bills, bonds, and \nstocks. Later studies that considered asset allocation across a broader range of asset classes \nfound that as much as 97% of fund returns can be explained by asset allocation alone. \n Sharpe\u2019s idea was to regress fund returns on indexes representing a range of asset \nclasses. The regression coefficient on each index would then measure the fund\u2019s implicit \nallocation to that \u201cstyle.\u201d Because funds are barred from short positions, the regression \ncoefficients are constrained to be either zero or positive and to sum to 100%, so as to rep-\nresent a complete asset allocation. The  R -square of the regression would then measure the \npercentage of return variability attributable to style or asset allocation, while the remainder \nof return variability would be attributable either to security selection or to market timing \nby periodic changes in the asset-class weights. \n To illustrate Sharpe\u2019s approach, we use monthly returns on Fidelity Magellan\u2019s Fund \nduring the famous manager Peter Lynch\u2019s tenure between October 1986 and September \n1991, with results shown in  Table\u00a0 24.5 . While seven asset classes are included in this \nanalysis (of which six are represented by stock indexes and one is the T-bill alternative), \nthe regression coefficients are positive for only three, namely, large capitalization stocks, \nmedium cap stocks, and high P/E (growth) stocks. These portfolios alone explain 97.5% \nof the variance of Magellan\u2019s returns. In other words, a tracking portfolio made up of the \nthree style portfolios, with weights as given in  Table\u00a024.5 , would explain the vast majority \nof Magellan\u2019s variation in monthly performance. We conclude that the fund returns are \nwell represented by three style portfolios.  \n The proportion of return variability  not  explained by asset allocation can be attrib-\nuted to security selection within asset classes, as well as timing that shows up as periodic \nchanges in allocation.

(The  R -square of the regression can be 100%, and yet the intercept can be non-\nzero due to a superior risk-adjusted abnormal return.) For Magellan, the intercept was 32 \nbasis points per month, resulting in a cumulative abnormal return over the 5-year period of \n19.19%. The superior performance of Magellan is displayed in  Figure\u00a024.8 , which plots the \ncumulative impact of the intercept plus monthly residuals relative to the tracking portfolio \ncomposed of the style portfolios. Except for the period surrounding the crash of October \n1987, Magellan\u2019s return consistently increased relative to the benchmark portfolio.  \n Style analysis provides an alternative to performance evaluation based on the security \nmarket line (SML) of the CAPM. The SML uses only one comparison portfolio, the broad \nmarket index, whereas style analysis more freely constructs a tracking portfolio from a \nnumber of specialized indexes. To compare the two approaches, the security characteristic \nline (SCL) of Magellan was estimated by regressing its excess return on the excess return \nof a market index composed of all NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ stocks. The beta estimate \nof Magellan was 1.11 and the  R -square of the regression was .99. The alpha value (inter-\ncept) of this regression was \u201conly\u201d 25 basis points per month, reflected in a cumulative \nabnormal return of 15.19% for the period. \n How can we explain the higher  R -square of the regression with only one factor (the \nmarket index) relative to the style regression, which deploys six stock indexes? The answer \nis that style analysis imposes extra constraints on the regression coefficients: It forces them \nto be positive and to sum to 1.0. This \u201cneat\u201d representation may not be consistent with \nactual portfolio weights that are constantly changing over time. So which representation \nbetter gauges Magellan\u2019s performance over the period? There is no clear-cut answer. The \nSML benchmark is a better representation of performance relative to the theoretically pre-\nscribed passive portfolio, that is, the broadest market index available.

If \nthe strategy revealed by the style \nanalysis method is consistent with \nthe one stated in the fund prospec-\ntus, then the performance relative \nto this strategy is the correct mea-\nsure of the fund\u2019s success. \n  Figure\u00a0 24.9  shows the fre-\nquency distribution of average \nresiduals across 636 mutual funds \nfrom Sharpe\u2019s style analysis. The \ndistribution has the familiar bell \nshape with a slightly negative \nmean of  2 .074% per month. This \nshould remind you of Figure 11.7, \nwhere we presented the frequency \ndistribution of CAPM alphas for \na large sample of mutual funds. \nAs in Sharpe\u2019s study, these \nrisk-adjusted returns plot as a \nbell-shaped curve with slightly \nnegative mean.   \n   Style Analysis and Multifactor Benchmarks \n Style analysis raises an interesting question for performance evaluation. Suppose a growth-\nindex portfolio exhibited superior performance relative to a mutual fund benchmark such \nas the S&P 500 over some measurement period. Including this growth index in a style \nanalysis would eliminate this superior performance from the portfolio\u2019s estimated alpha \nvalue. Is this proper? Quite plausibly, the fund\u2019s analysts predicted that an active portfolio \nof growth stocks was underpriced and tilted the portfolio to take advantage of it. Clearly, \nthe contribution of this decision to an alpha value relative to the benchmark is a legitimate \npart of the overall alpha value of the fund, and should not be eliminated by style analysis. \nThis brings up a related question. \n Chapter 11 pointed out that the conventional performance benchmark today is a four-\nfactor model, which employs the three Fama-French factors (the return on the market \nindex, and returns to portfolios based on size and book-to-market ratio) augmented by \na momentum factor (a portfolio constructed based on prior-year stock return). Alphas \nestimated from these four factor portfolios control for a wide range of style choices that \nmay affect average returns. But using alpha values from a multifactor model presupposes \nthat a passive strategy would include the aforementioned factor portfolios. When is this \nreasonable? \n Use of any benchmark other than the fund\u2019s single-index benchmark is legitimate only \nif we assume that the factor portfolios in question are part of the fund\u2019s alternative passive \nstrategy. This assumption may be unrealistic in many cases where a single-index bench-\nmark is used for performance evaluation even if research shows a multifactor model better \nexplains asset returns.

This \nperformance attribution procedure starts with benchmark allocations to various indexes and attributes performance to asset allocation on the basis of deviation of actual from benchmark allocations. The performance benchmark may be and often is specified in advance without regard to any particular style portfolio.  \n  Style Analysis in Excel \n Style analysis has become very popular in the investment management industry and has spawned quite a few variations on Sharpe\u2019s methodology. Many portfolio managers utilize Web sites that help investors identify their style and stock selection performance. \n You can do style analysis with Excel\u2019s Solver. The strategy is to regress a fund\u2019s rate \nof return on those of a number of style portfolios (as in  Table\u00a024.5 ). The style portfolios are passive (index) funds that represent a style alternative to asset allocation. Suppose you choose three style portfolios, labeled 1\u20133. Then the coefficients in your style regression are alpha (the intercept that measures abnormal performance) and three slope coefficients, one for each style index. The slope coefficients reveal how sensitively the performance of the fund follows the return of each passive style portfolio. The residuals from this regres-sion,  e ( t ), represent \u201cnoise,\u201d that is, fund performance at each date,  t,  that is independent \nof any of the style portfolios. We cannot use a standard regression package in this analysis, however, because we wish to constrain each coefficient to be nonnegative and sum to 1.0, representing a portfolio of styles. \n To do style analysis using Solver, start with arbitrary coefficients (e.g., you can set \n a \u00a0 5 \u00a00 and set each  b \u00a0 5 \u00a01/3). Use these to compute the time series of residuals from the \nstyle regression according to\n    e(t)5R(t)23a1b\n1R1(t)1b2R2(t)1b3R3(t)4  (24.8)   \n where\n    R ( t )\u00a0 5 \u00a0Excess return on the measured fund for date  t   \n   R   i  ( t )\u00a0 5 \u00a0Excess return on the  i th style portfolio ( i \u00a0 5 \u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03)  \n   a \u00a0 5 \u00a0Abnormal performance of the fund over the sample period  \n   b   i  \u00a0 5 \u00a0Beta of the fund on the  i th style portfolio    \n Equation 24.8 yields the time series of residuals from your \u201cregression equation\u201d with \nthose arbitrary coefficients. Now square each residual and sum the squares. At this point, you call on the Solver to minimize the sum of squares by changing the value of the four coefficients. You will use the \u201cby changing variables\u201d command. You also add four con-straints to the optimization: three that force the betas to be nonnegative and one that forces them to sum to 1.0. \n Solver\u2019s output will give you the three style coefficients, as well as the estimate of the \nfund\u2019s unique, abnormal performance as measured by the intercept. The sum of squares also allows you to calculate the  R -square of the regression and  p -values as explained in Chapter\u00a08.    \n   24.6 Performance Attribution Procedures \n  Rather than focus on risk-adjusted returns, practitioners often want simply to ascertain which decisions resulted in superior or inferior performance. Superior investment perfor-mance depends on an ability to be in the \u201cright\u201d securities at the right time. Such timing and selection ability may be considered broadly, such as being in equities as opposed to \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   864bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   864 7/25/13   3:14 AM7/25/13   3:14 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation 865\nfixed-income securities when the stock market is performing well. Or it may be defined \nat a more detailed level, such as choosing the relatively better-performing stocks within a particular industry. \n Portfolio managers constantly make broad-brush asset allocation decisions as well as \nmore detailed sector and security allocation decisions within asset classes. Performance attribution studies attempt to decompose overall performance into discrete components that may be identified with a particular level of the portfolio selection process. \n Attribution studies start from the broadest asset allocation choices and progressively \nfocus on ever-finer details of portfolio choice. The difference between a managed port-folio\u2019s performance and that of a benchmark portfolio then may be expressed as the sum of the contributions to performance of a series of decisions made at the various levels of the portfolio construction process. For example, one common attribution system decom-poses performance into three components: (1) broad asset market allocation choices across equity, fixed-income, and money markets; (2) industry (sector) choice within each market; and (3) security choice within each sector. \n The attribution method explains the difference in returns between a managed portfo-\nlio,  P,  and a selected benchmark portfolio,  B,  called the    bogey    .   Suppose that the universe \nof assets for  P  and  B  includes  n  asset classes such as equities, bonds, and bills. For each \nasset class, a benchmark index portfolio is determined. For example, the S&P 500 may be chosen as a benchmark for equities. The bogey portfolio is set to have fixed weights in each asset class, and its rate of return is given by\n   r\nB5an\ni51wBirBi\n   where  w   Bi   is the weight of the bogey in asset class  i,  and  r   Bi   is the return on the benchmark \nportfolio of that class over the evaluation period. The portfolio managers choose weights \nin each class,  w   Pi  , based on their capital market expectations, and they choose a portfolio \nof the securities within each class based on their security analysis, which earns  r   Pi   over the \nevaluation period. Thus the return of the managed portfolio will be\n   rP5an\ni51wPirPi  \n The difference between the two rates of return, therefore, is\n    rP2rB5an\ni51wPirPi2an\ni51wBirBi5an\ni51(wPirPi2wBirBi)  (24.9)    \n Each term in the summation of Equation 24.9 can be rewritten in a way that shows how \nasset allocation decisions versus security selection decisions for each asset class contrib-\nuted to overall performance. We decompose each term of the summation into a sum of two terms as follows. Note that the two terms we label as contribution from asset allocation and contribution from security selection in the following decomposition do in fact sum to the total contribution of each asset class to overall performance.\n    Contribution from asset allocation (w\nPi2wBi)rBi\n1 Contribution from security selection wPi (rPi2rBi)\u00a0\n5 Total contribution from asset class iw PirPi2wBirBi  \n The first term of the sum measures the impact of asset allocation because it shows how deviations of the actual weight from the benchmark weight for that asset class multiplied \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   865bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   865 7/25/13   3:14 AM7/25/13   3:14 AMFinal PDF to printer\n8 6 6 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nby the index return for the \nasset class added to or sub-\ntracted from total perfor-\nmance. The second term \nof the sum measures the \nimpact of security selec-\ntion because it shows how \nthe manager\u2019s excess return \n within   the asset class com-\npared to the benchmark \nreturn for that class mul-\ntiplied by the portfolio \nweight for that class added \nto or subtracted from total \nperformance.  Figure\u00a0 24.10  \npresents a graphical inter-\npretation of the attribution \nof overall performance into \nsecurity selection versus \nasset allocation.  \n To illustrate this method, \nconsider the attribution \nresults for a hypothetical port-\nfolio. The portfolio invests \nin stocks, bonds, and money \nmarket securities. An attribution analysis appears in  Tables\u00a024.6  through  24.9 . The portfo-\nlio return over the month is 5.34%. \n The first step is to establish a benchmark level of performance against which perfor-\nmance ought to be compared. This benchmark, again, is called the bogey. It is designed to \nmeasure the returns the portfolio manager would earn if he or she were to follow a com-\npletely passive strategy. \u201cPassive\u201d in this context has two attributes. First, it means that \nthe allocation of funds across broad asset classes is set in accord with a notion of \u201cusual,\u201d \nor neutral, allocation across sectors. This would be considered a passive asset-market \nallocation. Second, it means that  within   each asset class, the portfolio manager holds an \nindexed portfolio such as the S&P 500 index for the equity sector. In such a manner, \nthe passive strategy used as a performance benchmark rules out asset allocation as well \nas security selection decisions. Any departure of the manager\u2019s return from the passive \nbenchmark must be due to either asset allocation bets (departures from the neutral alloca-\ntion across markets) or security selection bets (departures from the passive index within \nasset classes). \n While we have already discussed in earlier chapters the justification for indexing \nwithin sectors, it is worth briefly explaining the determination of the neutral alloca-\ntion of funds across the broad asset classes. Weights that are designated as \u201cneutral\u201d \nwill depend on the risk tolerance of the investor and must be determined in consulta-\ntion with the client. For example, risk-tolerant clients may place a large fraction of \ntheir portfolio in the equity market, perhaps directing the fund manager to set neutral \nweights of 75% equity, 15% bonds, and 10% cash equivalents. Any deviation from \nthese weights must be justified by a belief that one or another market will either \n Figure 24.10 Performance attribution of  i th asset class.

In contrast, more risk-averse cli-\nents may set neutral weights of 45%/35%/20% for the three markets. Therefore, their \nportfolios in normal circumstances will be exposed to less risk than that of the risk-\ntolerant client. Only intentional bets on market performance will result in departures \nfrom this profile. \n In  Table\u00a0 24.6 , the neutral weights have been set at 60% equity, 30% fixed income, \nand 10% cash (money market securities). The bogey portfolio, comprised of investments \nin each index with the 60/30/10 weights, returned 3.97%. The managed portfolio\u2019s mea-\nsure of performance is positive and equal to its actual return less the return of the bogey: \n5.34\u00a0 2 \u00a03.97\u00a0 5 \u00a01.37%. The next step is to allocate the 1.37% excess return to the separate \ndecisions that contributed to it.   \n   Asset Allocation Decisions \n Our hypothetical managed portfolio is invested in the equity, fixed-income, and money \nmarkets with weights of 70%, 7%, and 23%, respectively. The portfolio\u2019s performance \ncould have to do with the departure of this weighting scheme from the benchmark \n60/30/10 weights and/or to superior or inferior results  within   each of the three broad \nmarkets. \n To isolate the effect of the manager\u2019s asset allocation choice, we measure the perfor-\nmance of a hypothetical portfolio that would have been invested in the indexes for each \nmarket with weights 70/7/23. This return measures the effect of the shift away from the \nbenchmark 60/30/10 weights without allowing for any effects attributable to active man-\nagement of the securities selected within each market. \n Superior performance relative to the bogey is achieved by overweighting investments in \nmarkets that turn out to perform well and by underweighting those in poorly performing \nmarkets. The contribution of asset allocation to superior performance equals the sum over \nall markets of the excess weight (sometimes called the  active weight   in the industry) in \neach market times the return of the market index. \n Panel A of  Table\u00a024.7  demonstrates that asset allocation contributed 31 basis points to \nthe portfolio\u2019s overall excess return of 137 basis points. The major factor contributing to \nsuperior performance in this month is the heavy weighting of the equity market in a month \nwhen the equity market has an excellent return of 5.81%.  \n    Bogey Performance and Excess Return  \n  Component    Benchmark \nWeight    Return of Index \nduring Month (%)  \n Equity (S&P 500)  .60  5.81 \n Bonds (Barclays Aggregate Index)  .30  1.45 \n Cash (money market)  .10  0.48 \n Bogey\u00a0 5 \u00a0(.60\u00a0 3 \u00a05.81)\u00a0 1 \u00a0(.30\u00a0 3 \u00a01.45)\u00a0 1 \u00a0(.10\u00a0 3 \u00a00.48)\u00a0 5 \u00a03.97% \n    Return of managed portfolio 5.34%  \n2 Return of bogey portfolio 3.97\nExcess return of managed portfolio 1.37% Table 24.6 \n Performance of \nthe managed \nportfolio \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   867bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   867 7/25/13   3:14 AM7/25/13   3:14 AMFinal PDF to printer\n8 6 8 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  Sector and Security Selection Decisions \n If .31% of the excess performance ( Table\u00a024.7,  panel A) can be attributed to advantageous \nasset allocation across markets, the remaining 1.06% then must be attributable to sector \nselection and security selection within each market.  Table\u00a024.7,  panel B, details the contri-\nbution of the managed portfolio\u2019s sector and security selection to total performance. \n Panel B shows that the equity component of the managed portfolio has a return of \n7.28% versus a return of 5.81% for the S&P 500. The fixed-income return is 1.89% versus \n1.45% for the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index. The superior performance in both equity \nand fixed-income markets weighted by the portfolio proportions invested in each market \nsums to the 1.06% contribution to performance attributable to sector and security selection. \n  Table\u00a0 24.8  documents the sources of the equity market performance by each sector \nwithin the market. The first three columns detail the allocation of funds within the equity \nmarket compared to their representation in the S&P 500. Column (4) shows the rate of \nreturn of each sector. The contribution of each sector\u2019s allocation presented in column (5) \nequals the product of the difference in the sector weight and the sector\u2019s performance.  \n Note that good performance (a positive contribution) derives from overweighting well-\nperforming sectors such as consumer noncyclicals, as well as underweighting poorly per-\nforming sectors such as technology. The excess return of the equity component of the \nportfolio attributable to sector allocation alone is 1.29%.  Table\u00a024.7 , panel B, column (3), \nshows that the equity component of the portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 by 1.47%. We \nconclude that the effect of security selection  within   sectors must have contributed an addi-\ntional 1.47%\u00a0 2 \u00a01.29%, or .18%, to the performance of the equity component of the portfolio. \n A similar sector analysis can be applied to the fixed-income portion of the portfolio, but \nwe do not show those results here.  \nA.

Sector and security allocation \nwithin those markets contributes 106 basis points, for total excess portfolio performance \nof 137 basis points.  \n The sector and security allocation of 106 basis points can be partitioned further. Sector \nallocation within the equity market results in excess performance of 129 basis points, and \nsecurity selection within sectors contributes 18 basis points. (The total equity excess per-\nformance of 147 basis points is multiplied by the 70% weight in equity to obtain contribu-\ntion to portfolio performance.)

Appro-\npriate performance measures are as follows:\n     a .   Sharpe: when the portfolio represents the entire investment fund.  \n    b .   Information ratio: when the portfolio represents the active portfolio to be optimally mixed \nwith the passive portfolio.  \n    c.  Treynor or Jensen: when the portfolio represents one subportfolio of many.     \n    2 .   Many observations are required to eliminate the effect of the \u201cluck of the draw\u201d from the evalu-\nation process because portfolio returns commonly are very \u201cnoisy.\u201d  \n    3 .   Hedge funds or other active positions meant to be mixed with a passive indexed portfolio should \nbe evaluated based on their information ratio.

The shifting mean and variance of actively managed portfolios make it even harder to assess per-\nformance. A typical example is the attempt of portfolio managers to time the market, resulting in ever-changing portfolio betas.  \n    5 .   A simple way to measure timing and selection success simultaneously is to estimate an expanded security characteristic line, with a quadratic term added to the usual index model. Another way to evaluate timers is based on the implicit call option embedded in their performance.  \n    6 .   Style analysis uses a multiple regression model where the factors are category (style) portfolios such as bills, bonds, and stocks. A regression of fund returns on the style portfolio returns gener-ates residuals that represent the value added of stock selection in each period. These residuals can be used to gauge fund performance relative to similar-style funds.  \n    7 .   The Morningstar Star Rating method compares each fund to a peer group represented by a style portfolio within four asset classes. Risk-adjusted ratings (RAR) are based on fund returns relative to the peer group and used to award each fund one to five stars based on the rank of its RAR. The MRAR is the only manipulation-proof performance measure.  \n    8 .   Common attribution procedures partition performance improvements to asset allocation, sector selection, and security selection.

Is it possible that a positive alpha will be associated with inferior performance? Explain.  \n   3. We know that the geometric average (time-weighted return) on a risky investment is always lower \nthan the corresponding arithmetic average. Can the IRR (the dollar-weighted return) similarly be \nranked relative to these other two averages?     \n    4.  W e have seen that market timing has tremendous potential value. Would it therefore be wise to \nshift resources to timing at the expense of security selection?  \n   5.

Consider the following information regarding the performance of a money manager in a recent \nmonth. The table represents the actual return of each sector of the manager\u2019s portfolio in col-\numn 1, the fraction of the portfolio allocated to each sector in column 2, the benchmark or neu-tral sector allocations in column 3, and the returns of sector indices in column 4.\n    Actual Return    Actual Weight    Benchmark Weight    Index Return  \n Equity  2%  .70  .60  2.5% (S&P 500) \n Bonds  1  .20  .30  1.2 (Salomon Index) \n Cash  0.5  .10  .10  0.5 \n     a .

A global equity manager is assigned to select stocks from a universe of large stocks through-\nout the world. The manager will be evaluated by comparing her returns to the return on the MSCI World Market Portfolio, but she is free to hold stocks from various countries in whatever proportions she finds desirable.

Conventional wisdom says that one should measure a manager\u2019s investment performance over \nan entire market cycle. What arguments support this convention? What arguments contradict it?  \n   14. Does the use of universes of managers with similar investment styles to evaluate relative invest-\nment performance overcome the statistical problems associated with instability of beta or total variability?  \n   15. During a particular year, the T-bill rate was 6%, the market return was 14%, and a portfolio \nmanager with beta of .5 realized a return of 10%.\n     a .   Evaluate the manager based on the portfolio alpha.  \n    b .   Reconsider your answer to part ( a ) in view of the Black-Jensen-Scholes finding that the \nsecurity market line is too flat. Now how do you assess the manager\u2019s performance?     \n   16. Bill Smith is evaluating the performance of four large-cap equity portfolios: Funds  A,   B,   C,  and \n D.  As part of his analysis, Smith computed the Sharpe ratio and the Treynor measure for all four \nfunds.

Primo has been hearing more and \nmore about benchmark portfolios and is interested in trying this approach. As such, the com-pany hired Sally Jones, CFA, as a consultant to educate the managers on the best methods for constructing a benchmark portfolio, how best to choose a benchmark, whether the style of the fund under management matters, and what they should do with their global funds in terms of benchmarking. \n For the sake of discussion, Jones put together some comparative 2-year performance  numbers \nthat relate to Primo\u2019s current domestic funds under management and a potential benchmark. \n    Weight    Return  \n  Style Category    Primo    Benchmark    Primo    Benchmark  \n Large-cap growth  .60  .50  17%  16% \n Mid-cap growth  .15  .40  24  26 \n Small-cap growth  .25  .10  20  18 \n   As part of her analysis, Jones also takes a look at one of Primo\u2019s global funds.

On average, the British stocks outperformed the Dutch stocks. The euro appreciated 6% versus the U.S. dollar over the holding period while the pound depreciated 2% versus the dollar. In terms of the local return, Primo outperformed the benchmark with the Dutch investments, but underperformed the index with respect to the British stocks.     \n   17.

The market proxy and benchmark for performance measurement purposes is the S&P \n500. Although the Miranda portfolio generally mirrors the asset class and sector weightings of the S&P, Blakely is allowed a significant amount of leeway in managing the fund. Her portfolio holds only stocks found in the S&P 500 and cash. \n Blakely was able to produce exceptional returns last year (as outlined in the table below) \nthrough her market timing and security selection skills. At the outset of the year, she became extremely concerned that the combination of a weak economy and geopolitical uncertainties would negatively impact the market. Taking a bold step, she changed her market allocation. For the entire year her asset class exposures averaged 50% in stocks and 50% in cash. The S&P\u2019s allocation between stocks and cash during the period was a constant 97% and 3%, respectively. The risk-free rate of return was 2%.\nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   875bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   875 7/31/13   6:26 PM7/31/13   6:26 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm876 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nOne-Year Trailing Returns\nMiranda Fund S&P 500\nReturn 10.2% \u201322.5%\nStandard deviation 37% 44%\nBeta 1.10 1.00\n     a .

Carl Karl, a portfolio manager for the Alpine Trust Company, has been responsible since 2015 \nfor the City of Alpine\u2019s Employee Retirement Plan, a municipal pension fund. Alpine is a \ngrowing community, and city services and employee payrolls have expanded in each of the past \n10 years. Contributions to the plan in fiscal 2020 exceeded benefit payments by a three-to-one \nratio. \n The plan board of trustees directed Karl 5 years ago to invest for total return over the long \nterm. However, as trustees of this highly visible public fund, they cautioned him that volatile or \nerratic results could cause them embarrassment. They also noted a state statute that mandated that \nnot more than 25% of the plan\u2019s assets (at cost) be invested in common stocks. \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   876bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   876 7/25/13   3:14 AM7/25/13   3:14 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation 877\n At the annual meeting of the trustees in November 2020, Karl presented the following portfo-\nlio and performance report to the board: \nAlpine Employee Retirement Plan\nAsset Mix as of 9/30/20 At Cost (millions) At Market (millions)\nFixed-income assets:\n  Short-term securities $ 4.5 11.0% $ 4.5 11.4%\n  Long-term bonds and mortgages 26.5 64.7 23.5 59.5 \nCommon stocks  10.0   24.3  11.5  29.1\n$41.0 100.0% $39.5 100.0%\nInvestment Performance\nAnnual Rates of Return for \nP eriods Ending 9/30/20\n5 Years 1 Year\nTotal Alpine Fund:\n Time-weighted 8.2% 5.2%\n Dollar-weighted (internal) 7.7% 4.8%\nAssumed actuarial return 6.0% 6.0%\nU.S. Treasury bills 7.5% 11.3%\nLarge sample of pension funds (average 60% equities, \n 40% fixed income)10.1% 14.3%\nCommon stocks\u2014Alpine Fund 13.3% 14.3%\n Alpine portfolio beta coefficient 0.90 0.89\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index 13.8% 21.1%\nFixed-income securities\u2014Alpine Fund 6.7% 1.0%\nSalomon Brothers\u2019 bond index 4.0% 211.4%\n   Karl was proud of his performance and was chagrined when a trustee made the following critical \nobservations:\n     a .   \u201cOur 1-year results were terrible, and it\u2019s what you\u2019ve done for us lately that counts most.\u201d  \n    b .   \u201cOur total fund performance was clearly inferior compared to the large sample of other \npension funds for the last 5 years.

The Retired Fund is an open-ended mutual fund composed of $500 million in U.S. bonds and \nU.S. Treasury bills. This fund has had a portfolio duration (including T-bills) of between 3 and 9 years. Retired has shown first-quartile performance over the past 5 years, as measured by an independent fixed-income measurement service. However, the directors of the fund would like to \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   877bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   877 7/25/13   3:14 AM7/25/13   3:14 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm878 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nmeasure the market timing skill of the fund\u2019s sole bond investor manager. An external consulting \nfirm has suggested the following three methods:\n     a .   Method I examines the value of the bond portfolio at the beginning of every year, then calcu-\nlates the return that would have been achieved had that same portfolio been held throughout the year. This return would then be compared with the return actually obtained by the fund.  \n    b .   Method II calculates the average weighting of the portfolio in bonds and T-bills for each year. Instead of using the actual bond portfolio, the return on a long-bond market index and T-bill index would be used. For example, if the portfolio on average was 65% in bonds and 35% in T-bills, the annual return on a portfolio invested 65% in a long-bond index and 35% in T-bills would be calculated. This return is compared with the annual return that would have been generated using the indexes and the manager\u2019s actual bond/T-bill weighting for each quarter of the year.  \n    c.  Method III examines the net bond purchase activity (market value of purchases less sales) for each quarter of the year. If net purchases were positive (negative) in any quarter, the perfor-mance of the bonds would be evaluated until the net purchase activity became negative (posi-tive). Positive (negative) net purchases would be viewed as a bullish (bearish) view taken by the manager. The correctness of this view would be measured. \n   Critique  each  method with regard to market timing measurement problems. \n  Use the following data to solve CFA Problems 4\u20136:  The administrator of a large pension \nfund wants to evaluate the performance of four portfolio managers. Each portfolio manager invests only in U.S. common stocks. Assume that during the most recent 5-year period, the aver-age annual total rate of return including dividends on the S&P 500 was 14%, and the average nominal rate of return on government Treasury bills was 8%.

In measuring the performance of a portfolio, the time-weighted rate of return is superior to the \ndollar-weighted rate of return because:\n     a .   When the rate of return varies, the time-weighted return is higher.  \n    b .   The dollar-weighted return assumes all portfolio deposits are made on day 1.  \n    c.  The dollar-weighted return can only be estimated.  \n    d .   The time-weighted return is unaffected by the timing of portfolio contributions and \nwithdrawals.     \n   11. A pension fund portfolio begins with $500,000 and earns 15% the first year and 10% the second \nyear. At the beginning of the second year, the sponsor contributes another $500,000. What were the time-weighted and dollar-weighted rates of return?  \n   12. During the annual review of Acme\u2019s pension plan, several trustees questioned their investment \nconsultant about various aspects of performance measurement and risk assessment.\n     a .   Comment on the appropriateness of using each of the following benchmarks for perfor-\nmance evaluation:\n    \u2022 Market index.  \n   \u2022 Benchmark normal portfolio.  \n   \u2022 Median of the manager universe.     \n    b .   Distinguish among the following performance measures:\n    \u2022 The Sharpe ratio.  \n   \u2022 The Treynor measure.  \n   \u2022 Jensen\u2019s alpha.\n     i. Describe how each of the three performance measures is calculated.      ii.  State whether each measure assumes that the relevant risk is systematic, unsystematic, or \ntotal. Explain how each measure relates excess return and the relevant risk.           \n   13. Trustees of the Pallor Corp. pension plan ask consultant Donald Millip to comment on the fol-\nlowing statements. What should his response be?\n     a .   Median manager benchmarks are statistically unbiased measures of performance over long \nperiods of time.  \n    b .   Median manager benchmarks are unambiguous and are therefore easily replicated by man-agers wishing to adopt a passive/indexed approach.  \n    c.  Median manager benchmarks are not appropriate in all circumstances because the median manager universe encompasses many investment styles.     \n   14. James Chan is reviewing the performance of the global equity managers of the Jarvis University \nendowment fund. Williamson Capital is currently the endowment fund\u2019s only large-capitaliza-tion global equity manager. Performance data for Williamson Capital are shown in  Table\u00a024A . \n Chan also presents the endowment fund\u2019s investment committee with performance informa-\ntion for Joyner Asset Management, which is another large-capitalization global equity manager. Performance data for Joyner Asset Management are shown in  Table\u00a024B . Performance data for the relevant risk-free asset and market index are shown in  Table\u00a024C .\n     a .   Calculate the Sharpe ratio and Treynor measure for both Williamson Capital and Joyner \nAsset Management.  \n    b .   The Investment Committee notices that using the Sharpe ratio versus the Treynor measure produces different performance rankings of Williamson and Joyner. Explain why these crite-ria may result in different rankings.       \nbod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   879bod61671_ch24_835-881.indd   879 7/25/13   3:14 AM7/25/13   3:14 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm880 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n Table 24C \n Relevant risk-free asset and market index \n performance data, 1999\u20132010 Risk-Free Asset\nAverage annual rate of return 5.0%\nMarket IndexAverage annual rate of return 18.9%\nStandard deviation of returns 13.8%\n E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES \n Several popular finance-related Web sites offer mutual fund screeners.

U.S. equities rep-resent less than 40% of world equities and a far smaller fraction of total world wealth. In this chapter, we look beyond domestic markets to survey issues of international and extended diversification. In one sense, international investing may be viewed as no more than a straightforward generaliza-tion of our earlier treatment of portfolio selection with a larger menu of assets from which to construct a portfolio. Similar issues of diversification, security analysis, security selection, and asset allocation face the inves-tor. On the other hand, international invest-ments pose some problems not encountered in domestic markets. Among these are the presence of exchange rate risk, restrictions on capital flows across national boundar-ies, an added dimension of political risk and country-specific regulations, and differing accounting practices in different countries. Therefore, in this chapter we review the major topics covered in the rest of the book, emphasizing their international aspects. We start with the central concept of portfo-lio theory\u2014diversification. We will see that global diversification offers opportunities for improving portfolio risk\u2013return trade-offs. We also will see how exchange rate fluctuations and political risk affect the risk of international investments. We next turn to passive and active investment styles in the international context. We will consider some of the special problems involved in the inter-pretation of passive index portfolios, and we will show how active asset allocation can be generalized to incorporate country and currency choices in addition to traditional domestic asset class choices. Finally, we dem-onstrate performance attribution for inter-national investments.

[the sponsor of the British FTSE (Financial Times Share Exchange) stock market index] uses \n14 specific criteria to divide countries into \u201cdeveloped\u201d and \u201cemerging\u201d lists. Our list of developed countries \nincludes all 25 countries that appear on FTSE\u2019s list.   You can easily invest today in capital markets of nearly 100 countries and obtain \nup-to-date data about your investments in each of them. By 2011, 52 countries had stock markets with aggregate market capitalization above $1 billion. The data and discussion in this chapter are based on these countries. \n The investments industry commonly distinguishes between \u201cdeveloped\u201d and \u201cemerg-\ning\u201d markets. A typical emerging economy still is undergoing industrialization, is growing faster than developed economies, and has capital markets that usually entail greater risk. We use the FTSE  \n1   criteria, which emphasize capital market conditions, to classify markets \nas emerging or developed.    \n   Developed Countries \n To appreciate the myopia of an exclusive investment focus on U.S. stocks and bonds, consider the data in  Table\u00a025.1 . The U.S. accounts for less than 40% of world stock market capitaliza-tion. Clearly, active investors can attain better risk\u2013return trade-offs by extending their search for attractive securities to both developed and emerging markets. Developed countries made up 68% of world gross domestic product in 2010, and 85% of the world market capitalization.  \n The first two columns of  Table\u00a025.1  show market capitalization in 2000 and 2011. The first \nline shows capitalization for all world exchanges, showing total capitalization of corporate equity in 2011 as $38.2 trillion, of which U.S. stock exchanges made up $13.9 trillion, or 36.4%. The year-to-year changes in the figures in these columns demonstrate the volatility of these markets. \n The next three columns of  Table\u00a025.1  compare country equity capitalization as a per-\ncentage of the world\u2019s in 2000 and 2011, as well as the growth in capitalization over those 12 years. The two crises of the first dozen years of the 21st century, the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000\u20132001 and the financial crisis of 2008\u20132009, hit the developed coun-tries hardest. Average growth of developed-country equity markets over these years was an anemic 1.7%, compared with a world average of 2.8% and 16.3% for emerging markets. \n The last three columns of  Table\u00a025.1  show GDP, per capita GDP, and the equity capi-\ntalization as a percentage of GDP in 2010. Although per capita GDP in developed coun-tries is not as variable across countries as total GDP, which is determined in part by total population, market capitalization as a percentage of GDP is quite variable. This suggests widespread differences in economic structure even across developed countries.  \n  Emerging Markets \n For a passive strategy, one could argue that a portfolio of equities of just the six countries with the largest capitalization would make up 64% (in 2011) of the world portfolio and may be sufficiently diversified. However, this argument will not hold for active portfo-lios that seek to tilt investments toward promising assets. Active portfolios will naturally include many stocks or indexes of emerging markets. \n  Table\u00a0 25.2  makes the point. Surely, active portfolio managers must prudently scour \nstocks in markets such as China and Russia with annual growth rates so far in the 21st cen-tury in excess of 33% (\n1\u20443 per year!).  Table\u00a025.2  shows data from the 20 largest emerging \nmarkets. But managers also would not want to have missed other markets that exhibited marked, if not quite so dramatic, growth over the same years.  \n These 20 emerging markets make up 24% of the world GDP and, together with the 32 \ndeveloped markets in  Table\u00a025.1 , make up 92% of the world GDP.

As a corollary, we expect that development of equity markets will serve as a catalyst for enrichment of the population, that is, that countries with larger relative capi-talization of equities will tend to be richer. For rich countries, with already-large equity markets, this relationship will be weaker. \n  Figure\u00a025.1  depicts the relationship  \n2   between per capita GDP and market capitalization \n(where both variables have been transformed to log 10  scale).  Figure\u00a025.1 , panel A shows a scat-\nter diagram and regression line for 2000, while the situation in 2011 is shown in  Figure\u00a025.1 , panel B. While developed markets are mostly above the line and emerging markets mostly below it, the latter dramatically moved up in relative market capitalization over these years. This move was sufficient to greatly moderate the slope of the line. One can also easily see the upward shift of the whole world on the vertical axis that measures per capita GDP.   \n The regression slope coefficient measures the average percent change in per capita \nincome when market capitalization increases by 1%. In 2000, this value was .64, but it fell to .35 in 2011. The scatter around the regression line has also visibly grown, as reflected in an R-square of .52 in 2000 but only .10 in 2011.  \n  Home-Country Bias \n Home-country bias refers to the common tendency for investors to underweight foreign equities in their portfolio of risky assets. If investors allocated their stock investments across countries in proportion to outstanding equity, U.S. investors in 2011 would have placed only 36.4% of their equity in U.S. firms ( Table\u00a025.1 ) with the remaining 63.6% held in foreign markets. Non-U.S. investors would have held a greater share of U.S. equities than domestic investors. But in fact, most investors show a pronounced bias toward hold-ing stock in their home countries. \n U.S. investors\u2019 holdings of foreign stocks and long-term bonds and foreigners\u2019 holdings \nof U.S stocks and long-term bonds in 2001 and 2011 were:   \n Year  U.S. Investor \nHoldings Abroad  a    Foreign Investor \nHoldings in U.S.  b   \n 2001  2,170   3,932 \n 2011  6,481  11,870 \n   a Billions of dollars.  \n   b About 2/3 of these holding are in equities.  \n Source: Report on U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities as of 12/31/2011. \nDepartment of the Treasury, October 2012. \n Home-country bias remains in force but is far less pronounced today than it was 10\u00a0years\u00a0ago.    \n  2 This simple single-variable regression is put forward not as a causal model but simply as a way to describe the \nrelation between per capita GDP and the size of markets. \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   886bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   886 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 25 International Diversification 887\n Figure 25.1 Per capita GDP and market capitalization as percent of GDP.

Two risk factors that are unique to international investments are exchange \nrate risk and political risk, discussed in the next two sections.  \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   887bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   887 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n888 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n   Exchange Rate Risk \n It is best to begin with a simple example.  \n Using the data in Example 25.1, calculate the \nrate of return in dollars to a U.S. investor hold-ing the British bill if the year-end exchange rate is: ( a )  E  \n1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2.00/\u00a3; ( b )  E  1 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$2.20/\u00a3.  CONCEPT CHECK 25.1  We can generalize from  Example 25.1 . The $20,000 is exchanged for $20,000/ E  0  \npounds, where  E  0  denotes the original exchange rate ($2/\u00a3). The U.K. investment grows to \n(20,000/ E  0 )[1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  (UK)] British pounds, where  r   f  (UK) is the risk-free rate in the United \nKingdom. The pound proceeds ultimately are converted back to dollars at the subsequent \nexchange rate  E  1 , for total dollar proceeds of 20,000( E  1 / E  0 )[1\u00a0  1 \u00a0 r   f  (UK)]. The dollar-\ndenominated return on the investment in British bills, therefore, is   \n 1 1r(US)5311rf(UK)4E1/E0  (25.1)   \n We see in Equation 25.1 that the dollar-denominated return for a U.S. investor equals \nthe pound-denominated return times the exchange rate \u201creturn.\u201d For a U.S. investor, the \ninvestment in British bills is a combination of a safe investment in the United Kingdom and a risky investment in the performance of the pound relative to the dollar. Here, the pound fared poorly, falling from a value of $2 to only $1.80. The loss on the pound more than offset the earnings on the British bill. \n  Figure\u00a025.2  illustrates this point. It presents rates of \nreturns on stock market indexes in several countries for 2010. The colored bars depict returns in local currencies, while the dark bars depict returns in dollars, adjusted for exchange rate movements. It\u2019s clear that exchange rate fluctuations over this period had large effects on dollar-denominated returns in several countries.  \n \n Pure    exchange rate risk    is the risk borne by invest-\nments in foreign safe assets. The investor in U.K. bills of \nExample 25.1 bears the risk of the U.K./U.S. exchange rate only. We can assess the mag-nitude of exchange rate risk by examining historical rates of change in various exchange rates and their correlations. \n  Table\u00a0 25.3 , panel A shows historical exchange rate risk measured by the standard \ndeviation of monthly percent changes in the exchange rates of major currencies against the U.S. dollar over the period 2001\u20132011. The data show that currency risk is quite high. The annualized standard deviation of the percent changes in the exchange rate ranged from 9.13% (Japanese yen) to 13.87% (Australian dollar). The standard  deviation  Consider an investment in risk-free British government bills paying 10% annual interest \nin British pounds. While these U.K. bills would be the risk-free asset to a British inves-tor, this is not the case for a U.S. investor. Suppose, for example, the current exchange rate is $2 per pound, and the U.S. investor starts with $20,000. That amount can be exchanged for \u00a310,000 and invested at a riskless 10% rate in the United Kingdom to provide \u00a311,000 in 1 year. \n What happens if the dollar\u2013pound exchange rate varies over the year? Say that dur-\ning the year, the pound depreciates relative to the dollar, so that by year-end only $1.80 \nis required to purchase \u00a31. The \u00a311,000 can be exchanged at the year-end exchange rate for only $19,800 ( 5 \u00a0\u00a311,000\u00a0 3 \u00a0$1.80/\u00a3), resulting in a loss of $200 relative to the \ninitial $20,000 investment. Despite the positive 10% pound-denominated return, the dollar-denominated return is negative 1%.

Hence, exchange rate \nvolatility was roughly 70% that of the volatility on stocks. Clearly, an active investor \nwho believes that a foreign stock is underpriced but has no information about any mis-\npricing of its currency should consider hedging the currency risk exposure when tilt-\ning the portfolio toward the stock. Exchange rate risk of the major currencies has been \nrelatively high so far in this century. For example, a study by Solnik (1999) for the \nperiod 1971\u20131998 finds lower standard deviations, ranging from 4.8% (Canadian dollar) \nto 12% (Japanese yen).   \n In the context of international portfolios, exchange rate risk may be mostly diversifi-\nable. This is evident from the low correlation coefficients in  Table\u00a025.3 , panel B. (There \nare notable exceptions in the table, though, and this observation will be reinforced when \nwe compare the risk of hedged and unhedged country portfolios in a later section.) Thus, \npassive investors with well-diversified international portfolios need not be concerned with \nhedging exposure to foreign currencies. \n The effect of exchange rate fluctuations also shows up in  Table\u00a025.3 , panel C, which \npresents the returns on money market investments in different countries. While these invest-\nments are virtually risk-free in local currency, they are risky in dollar terms because of \nexchange rate risk. International investment flows by currency speculators should roughly \nequalize the expected dollar returns in various currencies, adjusted for risk. Moreover, \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   889bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   889 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n8 9 0 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nA.

The low yen-denominated LIBOR rate, .24%, compared to the U.S.-dollar LIBOR \nrate, 2.18%, suggests that investors expected the yen to appreciate against the dollar by \naround 1.94%, the interest rate differential across the two countries. But those expectations \nwere not realized; in fact, the yen actually appreciated against the dollar at an annual rate \nof 5.75%, leading to an annual dollar-denominated return on a yen investment of 5.99% \n(the .24% yen interest rate together with the realized exchange rate appreciation of 5.75%). \nHowever, such deviations between prior expectations and actual returns of this magnitude \nare not shocking. The \u201csurprise\u201d return in a yen LIBOR investment (converted into dollars) \nwas the difference between the actual return in dollars, 5.99%, and the dollar-denominated \nLIBOR rate of 2.18%, amounting to 3.81%. This surprise is actually considerably less than \nthe yen standard deviation of 9.13%. In fact, none of the six surprises exceeded the stan-\ndard deviation, which is actually the  surprising event here. \n Investors can hedge exchange rate risk using a forward or futures contract in foreign \nexchange.

In this case, to \nhedge her exposure to the British pound, the U.S. investor would agree to deliver pounds for dollars at a fixed exchange rate, thereby eliminating the future risk involved with con-version of the pound investment back into dollars.  \n You may recall that the hedge underlying Example 25.2 is the same type of hedging \nstrategy at the heart of the spot-futures parity relationship first discussed in Chapter 22. In\u00a0 both instances, futures or forward markets are used to eliminate the risk of holding another asset. The U.S. investor can lock in a riskless dollar-denominated return either by investing in United Kingdom bills and hedging exchange rate risk or by investing in risk-less U.S. assets. Because investments in two riskless strategies must provide equal returns, we conclude that [1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r  \n f  (UK)] F  0 / E  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a01\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f  (US), which can be rearranged to   \n F0\nE0511rf(US)\n11rf(UK)  (25.2)   \n This relationship is called the    interest rate parity relationship    or    covered interest \n arbitrage relationship    ,  which we first encountered in Chapter 23. \n Unfortunately, such perfect exchange rate hedging usually is not so easy. In our exam-\nple, we knew exactly how many pounds to sell in the forward or futures market because the \npound-denominated return in the United Kingdom was riskless. If the U.K. investment had not been in bills, but instead had been in risky U.K. equity, we would have known neither the ultimate value in pounds of our U.K. investment nor how many pounds to sell forward. The hedging opportunity offered by foreign exchange forward contracts would thus be imperfect. \n To summarize, the generalization of Equation 25.1 for unhedged investments is that   \n 1 1r(US)5311r(forei\ngn)4E1/E0  (25.3)   \n where  r (foreign) is the possibly risky return earned in the currency of the foreign investment. You can set up a per-fect hedge only in the special case that  r (foreign) is itself \na known number. In that case, you know you must sell in the forward or futures market an amount of foreign cur-rency equal to [1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r (foreign)] for each unit of that cur-\nrency you purchase today. \n  \n  Political Risk \n In principle, security analysis at the macroeconomic, industry, and firm-specific level is \nsimilar in all countries. Such analysis aims to provide estimates of expected returns and risk of individual assets and portfolios. However, to achieve the same quality of informa-tion about assets in a foreign country is by nature more difficult and hence more expensive. Moreover, the risk of coming by false or misleading information is greater.  If the forward exchange rate in Example 25.1 had been  F  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0$1.93/\u00a3 when the invest-\nment was made, the U.S. investor could have assured a riskless dollar-denominated \nreturn by arranging to deliver the \u00a311,000 at the forward exchange rate of $1.93/\u00a3. In this case, the riskless U.S. return would then have been 6.15%:   \n[1\u00a01\u00a0r\nf(UK)]F 0/E0\u00a05\u00a0(1.10)1.93/2.00\u00a05\u00a01.0615   Example 25.2 Hedging Exchange Rate Risk \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   891bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   891 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n8 9 2 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  Rank in \n  January 2011    Country    Composite  \n Risk Rating  \n January 2011    Composite  \n Risk Rating  \n February 2012    January 2011  \n versus  \n February 2010    Rank in  \n February 2010  \n      Very low risk           \n 1  Norway   90.5   90.00  0.50  1 \n 11  Germany   83.5   83.50  0.00  5 \n 13  Canada   82.8   82.75  0.00  6 \n 16  Qatar   82.0   81.25  0.75  11 \n 19  Japan   81.0   80.00  1.00  17 \n      Low risk           \n 31  United Kingdom   77.3   73.75  3.50  39 \n 32  United States   77.0   77.25   2 0.25  26 \n 39  China, People\u2019s Rep.   75.0   76.25   2 1.25  30 \n 44  Brazil   74.5   72.75  1.75  46 \n 68  Spain   70.0   71.00   2 1.00  58 \n      Moderate risk           \n 78  Indonesia   68.5   67.25  1.25  81 \n 86  India   67.3   70.50   2 3.25  62 \n 104  Egypt   64.5   66.50   2 2.00  84 \n 111  Turkey   63.3   63.50   2 0.25  100 \n      High risk           \n 124  Venezuela   59.5   53.75  5.75  133 \n 127  Iraq   58.5   59.25   2 0.75  119 \n 129  Pakistan   57.3   57.00  0.25  125 \n      Very high risk           \n 138  Haiti   48.5   49.75   2 1.25  137 \n 140  Somalia   41.5   36.75  4.75  140 \nTable 25.4\nComposite risk ratings for January 2011 versus February 2010\nSource: International Country Risk Guide,  January 2011, Table 1, The PRS Group, Inc.

Consider two investors: an American wishing to invest in Indonesian stocks and an \nIndonesian wishing to invest in U.S. stocks. While each would have to consider macro-\neconomic analysis of the foreign country, the task would be much more difficult for the \nAmerican investor. The reason is not that investment in Indonesia is necessarily riskier \nthan investment in the U.S. You can easily find many U.S. stocks that are, in the final \nanalysis, riskier than a number of Indonesian stocks. The difference lies in the fact that \nU.S. financial markets are more transparent than those of Indonesia. \n In the past, when international investing was novel, the added risk was referred to as \n  political risk    and its assessment was an art. As cross-border investment has increased and \nmore resources have been utilized, the quality of related analysis has improved. A lead-\ning organization in the field (which is quite competitive) is the PRS Group (Political Risk \nServices) and the presentation here follows the PRS methodology.  3    \n PRS\u2019s country risk analysis results in a country composite risk rating on a scale of 0 \n(most risky) to 100 (least risky). Countries are then ranked by the composite risk measure \nand divided into five categories: very low risk (100\u201380), low risk (79.9\u201370), moderate risk \n(69.9\u201360), high risk (59.9\u201350), and very high risk (less than 50).

It is not surprising to find Norway at the top of the very-low-risk \nlist, and small emerging markets at the bottom, with Somalia (ranked 140) closing the list. \nWhat may be surprising is the fairly mediocre ranking of the U.S. (ranked 32), comparable \nto Libya (20) and Bahrain (29), all three in the low-risk category.  \n The composite risk rating is a weighted average of three measures: political risk, finan-\ncial risk, and economic risk. Political risk is measured on a scale of 100\u20130, while financial \nrisk and economic risk are measured on a scale of 50\u20130. The three measures are added and \ndivided by 2 to obtain the composite rating. The variables used by PRS to determine the \ncomposite risk rating from the three measures are shown in  Table\u00a025.5 .  \n  Table\u00a025.6  shows the three risk measures for seven of the countries in  Table\u00a025.4 , in \norder of the January 2011 ranking of the composite risk ratings.

Used with permission. performance of the U.S. in this dimension was probably due to its exceedingly large gov-\nernment and balance-of-trade deficits, which put considerable pressure on its exchange \nrate. Exchange rate stability, foreign trade imbalance, and foreign indebtedness all enter \nPRS\u2019s computation of financial risk. The financial crisis that began in August of 2008 was \na striking vindication of PRS\u2019s judgment of assigning relatively low financial scores to the \nU.S. and other major markets.  \n Country risk is captured in greater depth by scenario analysis for the composite mea-\nsure and each of its components.  Table\u00a025.7  (panels A and B) shows 1- and 5-year worst-\ncase and best-case scenarios for the composite ratings and for the political risk measure. \nRisk stability is based on the difference in the rating between the best- and worst-case \nscenarios and is quite large in most cases. The worst-case scenario can move a country to a \nhigher risk category. For example,  Table\u00a025.7 , panel B, shows that in the worst-case 5-year \nscenario, China and Turkey were particularly vulnerable to deterioration in the political \nenvironment.  \n Finally,  Table\u00a0 25.8  shows ratings of political risk by each of its 12 components. \nCorruption (variable F) in Japan is rated better than in the U.S. In democratic  accountability \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   894bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   894 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 25 International Diversification 895\n(variable K), China ranked worst, and the United States, Canada, and India best, while \nChina ranked best in government stability (variable A). \n Each monthly issue of the  International Country Risk Guide   of the PRS Group includes \ngreat detail and holds some 250 pages.

Used with permission.\n   25.3 International Investing: Risk, Return, \nand Benefits from Diversification \n  U.S. investors have several avenues through which they can invest internationally. The \nmost obvious method, which is available in practice primarily to larger institutional inves-\ntors, is to purchase securities directly in the capital markets of other countries. However, \neven small investors now can take advantage of several investment vehicles with an inter-\nnational focus. \n Shares of several foreign firms are traded in U.S. markets either directly or in the form \nof American depository receipts, or ADRs. A U.S. financial institution such as a bank will \npurchase shares of a foreign firm in that firm\u2019s country, then issue claims to those shares in \nthe United States. Each ADR is then a claim on a given number of the shares of stock held \nby the bank. Some stocks trade in the U.S. both directly and as ADRs. \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   895bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   895 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n896 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n There is also a wide array of mutual funds with an international focus. In addition to \nsingle-country funds, there are several open-end mutual funds with an international focus. \nFor example, Fidelity offers funds with investments concentrated overseas, generally in Europe, in the Pacific Basin, and in developing economies in an emerging opportunities fund. Vanguard, consistent with its indexing philosophy, offers separate index funds for Europe, the Pacific Basin, and emerging markets. Finally, as noted in Chapter 4, there are many exchange-traded funds known as iShares or WEBS (World Equity Benchmark Shares) that are country-specific index products. \n U.S. investors also can trade derivative securities based on prices in foreign security \nmarkets. For example, they can trade options and futures on the Nikkei stock index of 225 stocks traded on the Tokyo stock exchange, or on FTSE (Financial Times Share Exchange) indexes of U.K. and European stocks.  \n   Risk and Return: Summary Statistics \n Illustrations for most of our discussions in the remaining part of this chapter derive from a database of country market-index returns. We use 10 years of monthly returns over 2002\u20132011 for 48 non-U.S. country market indexes as well as the U.S. S&P 500. This decade stretches from the beginning of the recovery from the bursting of the tech bubble in 2001, through the low\u2013interest rate boom period that followed and the ensu-ing financial crisis of 2008, and, finally, to the beginning of the slow recovery from that crisis. \n Analysis of risky assets typically focuses on  excess  returns over the risk-free rate. This \nalone adds a perplexing aspect to international investing, since the appropriate risk-free rate varies around the globe. Rates of return on identical indexes (as well as individual assets) will generate different excess returns when safe bonds are denominated in different currencies. Although our perspective is U.S.-based, our methodology would serve inves-tors in any country, yet the numbers may differ when applied to risk-free rates denomi-nated in other currencies. \n The tumultuous period we analyze resulted in unexpected low average excess returns, \nprimarily in developed markets, while most emerging markets continued unabated growth. This fact alone conveys an important lesson. It provides an extreme example of the general observation that realized returns are very noisy reflections of investor expectations and may not provide accurate forecasts of future returns. Past returns do, however, provide an indication of risk, at least for the near future. While the near-efficient market hypothesis applies to  expected returns  (to wit: future returns cannot be forecast from past returns), \nit does  not  apply to forecasting risk. Thus our exercise will allow us to demonstrate the \ndistinction between what you can and cannot learn from historical returns that evidently departed from prior expectations. \n While active-strategy managers engage in both individual-market asset allocation and \nsecurity selection, we will restrict our international diversification to country market-index portfolios, keeping us on the side of an enhanced passive strategy. Nevertheless, our analy-sis illustrates the essential features of extended active management as well. \n We begin with an investigation of the characteristics of individual markets and then \nproceed to analyze the benefits of diversification, using portfolios constructed from these individual markets. The market capitalization of individual-country indexes can be found in  Tables\u00a025.1  and  25.2 , and the aggregated results for the portfolios are shown in  Table\u00a025.9A . This table also displays the performance of two types of portfolios: portfo-lios aggregated from country indexes and regional-index portfolios. The performances of individual-country-index portfolios are shown in  Table\u00a025.9B .    \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   896bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   896 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n897 For the aggregated country-index portfolios, we examine a strategy that constructs \nvalue-weighted portfolios of developed and emerging markets based on market capital-\nizations at the beginning of 2002. These portfolios are rebalanced after 5 years, in 2007, based on capitalizations at the end of 2006, and held for another 5 years. (Dividends are reinvested throughout the 10-year experiment.) Such a strategy is feasible to a large degree, since many (although, admittedly, not all) country-index portfolios are investable as index funds or ETFs. Because not all country indexes are investable, this hypothetical strategy perhaps generates a bit more efficient diversification than is actually possible. On the other hand, if actually held, these value-weighted portfolios would automatically be rebalanced to value weights continually. In contrast, we rebalance only once after five years, which slightly attenuates diversification benefits. On balance, then, we expect these hypothesized portfolios to perform about as well as a feasible country-based, passive international strategy. Index Funds Called WEBS Reduce the Cost of \nInvesting Abroad\n With foreign markets generally stronger this year, a new \nway to invest abroad has appeared at a good time. WEBS, an acronym for World Equity Benchmark Shares, represents an investment in a portfolio of publicly traded foreign stocks in a selected country. Each WEBS Index Series seeks to generate investment results that generally correspond to the price and yield performance of a specific Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index. \n You sell these shares rather than redeeming them, but \nthere the similarity to closed-end country funds ends. WEBS \nare equity securities, not mutual funds. WEBS shares trade continuously like any other publicly traded U.S. stock. In contrast, mutual fund shares do not trade in the secondary market, and are normally bought and sold from the issu-ing mutual fund at prices determined only at the end of the day. The new funds create and redeem shares in large blocks as needed, thus preventing the big premiums or discounts to net asset value typical of closed-end country funds. As index portfolios, WEBS are passively managed, so their expenses run much lower than for current open- or closed-end country funds. \n WEBS shares offer U.S. investors portfolio exposure to \ncountry-specific equity markets, in a single, listed security \nyou can easily buy, sell, or short. Unlike American Deposi-tory Receipts (ADRs) that give you an investment in just one company, WEBS shares enable you to gain exposure to a broad portfolio of a desired foreign country\u2019s stocks. You gain broad exposure in the country or countries of your choice without the complications usually associated with buying, owning, or monitoring direct investments in for-eign countries. You also have the conveniences of trading on a U.S. exchange and dealing in U.S. dollars. \n Some investors may prefer the active management, \ndiversity, and flexibility of open-end international equity index funds as a way to limit currency and political risks \nof investing in foreign markets. As conventional open-end funds, however, the international funds are sometimes forced by net redemptions to sell stocks at inopportune times, which can be a particular problem in foreign mar-kets with highly volatile stocks. \n You pay brokerage commissions on the purchase and \nsale of WEBS, but since their portfolios are passively man-\naged, their management and administrative fees are relatively low and they eliminate most of the transaction charges typical of managed funds. \nFOREIGN INDEX BASKETS\nWEBSTicker \nSymbol WEBSTicker Symbol\nAustralia EWA Malaysia EWM\nAustria EWO Mexico EWWBelgium EWK Netherlands EWNCanada EWC Singapore EWSFrance EWQ Spain EWP\nGermany EWG Sweden EWDHong Kong EWH Switzerland EWLItaly EWI U.K. EWU\nJapan EWJ\n Sources: Modified from  The Outlook,  May 22, 1996, published by \nStandard and Poor\u2019s; and Amex website,   www.amex.com,   \nFebruary 2000.  \nReprinted by permission of Standard & Poor\u2019s, a division of \nThe McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Management\n The performance of these portfolios is contrasted with that of completely feasible \ninternational diversification by investing in regional-index funds, which are also shown \nin  Table\u00a025.9A . This comparison is based on standard performance statistics, namely, \naverage and standard deviation of excess returns (denominated in U.S. dollars), as well \nas beta and alpha estimated against a U.S.-only portfolio. We will assess these perfor-\nmance statistics after we first take a broad-brush look at the return behavior of developed \nversus emerging market indexes.  \n  Are Investments in Emerging Markets Riskier? \n In  Figure\u00a0 25.3 , developed countries and emerging markets are separately ordered from \nlowest to highest standard deviation. The standard deviations of investments in emerg-\ning markets are charted with those in developed countries. The graphs clearly show that, \nconsidered as total portfolios, emerging markets are generally riskier than developed coun-\ntries, at least when risk is measured by total volatility of returns. Still, you can find emerg-\ning markets that appear safer than some developed countries. However, if one considers \nadding a foreign country index to an indexed U.S. portfolio, the relevant risk measure is \nthe country\u2019s beta against the U.S.  4     \n  Figure\u00a025.4  ranks and charts the betas of country returns (in U.S. dollars) against the \nU.S. index. It shows that betas of six developed and eight emerging markets were estimated \nto be below 1. Notice, however, that this is only about one-third of all 48 foreign markets. \nThus we can foresee the conclusion: A well-diversified international portfolio may well be \nriskier than the U.S. alone, which has consistently exhibited the lowest standard  deviation \n02468101214\n0 5 10 15 20 25Standard Deviation (%/month)\nRank\nMarkets are ranked by SD of return, from low to high25\n24232221\n20191817 16\n151413 1211109 8\n7 65432\n124\n23 22 21\n20191817 1615141312 11109876 5\n4321Developed+World\nEmerging  1 U.S. Malaysia \n  2 Japan Morocco \n  3 Switzerland Jordan \n  4 U.K. Chile \n  5 Israel Mexico \n  6 New Zealand Philippines \n  7 Canada Taiwan \n  8 Hong Kong Czech Republic \n  9 Denmark South Africa\n10 Singapore China\n11 Portugal Thailand\n12 Australia Colombia\n13 France Korea\n14 Netherlands India\n15 Italy Peru\n16 Belgium Indonesia\n17 Spain Pakistan\n18 Ireland Poland\n19 Germany Egypt\n20 Sweden Russia\n21 Austria Hungary\n22 Finland Brazil\n23 Norway Sri Lanka\n24 Greece Argentina\n25 TurkeyRank Developed Emerging Rank Legend\n Figure 25.3 Monthly standard deviation of excess returns in developed and emerging markets, 2002\u20132011  \n4 A sufficient condition to reduce the standard deviation of a portfolio by adding an asset is that the beta of the \nasset on the portfolio be less than 1. \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   900bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   900 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 25 International Diversification 901\n252423 22\n21\n20\n19\n181716151413 12\n109\n87\n6\n5\n432\n12423 22 21\n20 19\n18 171615 14 13\n12\n111098\n7 6\n5432\n111\n\u20130.100.100.300.500.700.901.101.301.501.70Beta on U.S.\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nRank\nMarkets are sorted by beta, from low to highDeveloped+World\nEmerging  1 Japan Pakistan \n  2 Switzerland Jordan \n  3 Israel Morocco \n  4 New Zealand Sri Lanka \n  5 Hong Kong Malaysia \n  6 U.K. Philippines \n  7 U.S. Egypt \n  8 Portugal Chile \n  9 Singapore Colombia\n10 Denmark Thailand\n11 Canada Argentina\n12 Australia Czech Republic\n13 Italy Peru\n14 Belgium China\n15 Spain Taiwan\n16 France South Africa\n17 Ireland Indonesia\n18 Netherlands India\n19 Austria Mexico\n20 Greece Russia\n21 Finland Korea\n22 Sweden Hungary\n23 Germany Poland\n24 Norway Brazil\n25 TurkeyRank Developed Emerging Rank Legend\n Figure 25.4 Beta against the U.S. market of developed and emerging markets, 2002\u20132011  \nof all countries. This is not to say, however, that an international portfolio with higher vari-\nance would necessarily be inferior. In fact, when a risk-free asset is available, minimum-\nvariance portfolios are never efficient (they are dominated by the maximum Sharpe ratio, \nor tangency, portfolio on the efficient frontier). But, then, the international portfolio must \nshow a sufficiently larger average return to provide a larger Sharpe ratio.  \n Comparison between developed and emerging markets\u2019 betas in  Figure\u00a025.4  shows that, \nin contrast to the picture painted by standard deviation, emerging markets are not meaning-\nfully riskier to U.S. investors than developed markets. This is the most important lesson \nfrom this exercise.  \n  Are Average Returns Higher in Emerging Markets? \n  Figure\u00a025.5  repeats the previous exercise for average excess returns. The graph shows \nthat emerging markets generally provided higher average returns than developed markets \nover the period 2002\u20132011. The fact that only 2 (developed) of the 49 markets aver-\naged a lower rate than the risk-free alternative is quite unusual given the volatility of \nthese markets. However, this result is partially due to the weak U.S. dollar over these \nyears. When measured in local currencies, returns in eight countries, all developed, aver-\naged below U.S. T-bills over the 10-year period. Beyond that, we see that countries with \nrelatively low betas (e.g., Pakistan) earned higher returns than countries with relatively \nhigh betas, even the highest-beta country, Turkey. Further, average returns in emerging \nmarkets were generally higher than those in developed countries despite the fact that \nemerging market betas were not higher, implying that emerging markets provided better \ndiversification opportunities than developed markets in this period.  \n We shouldn\u2019t be too surprised by these results. Remember again that the SD of an average esti-\nmated over 120 months is approximately SD(10-year average)\u00a0 5\u00a0SD(1-month average)/   \"120 . \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   901bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   901 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n9 0 2 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nThus, the SD of the 10-year average monthly return for Pakistan would be about .92%, and that of \nTurkey about 1.20%. A departure from mean return of one SD in opposite directions for these two \nportfolios would span a distance of about 2.12%, while the difference in average returns is only \n.21%. The conclusion is one we\u2019ve noted before: We cannot read too much into realized averages \neven over periods as long as 10 years. \n Instinct calls for estimating alpha or information ratios for individual markets, to see \nwhether they are distributed around zero. Recall from our discussion of performance eval-\nuation in Chapter 18 that, without positive alpha, we cannot conclude that an asset has \nshown superior performance on any measure. The information ratio measures the potential \nincrease in the Sharpe ratio if the country index were to be added in an optimal proportion \nto the U.S index. \n  Figure\u00a025.6  verifies that information ratios in emerging markets were, on the whole, \nclearly better than those in developed markets. This is a result of inferior performance of \nthe eight markets most affected by the financial crisis, all developed countries, and four \nstellar emerging market performers. The performance of the other 36 markets cannot be \ndistinguished in terms of emerging versus developed. Here again, given the high volatili-\nties, finding four outperformers and eight underperformers in a group of 48 countries is not \nsurprising or significant.  \n One striking result is the inferior performance of the U.S. We see this in  Table\u00a025.9 A: \nAlthough the U.S. has the lowest standard deviation among all countries, it still ranks near \nthe bottom in terms of the Sharpe ratio. This may be explained by the financial crisis and/\nor by the steady decline in the international economic position of the U.S, as reflected \nby the steady decline in the value of the dollar.  5   To investigate the latter possibility, \n Figure 25.5 Average dollar-denominated excess returns of developed and emerging markets, 2002\u20132011  \n\u20131.0\u20130.50.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5\n0 51 0 1 5 2 0 2 5Average Excess Return (%/month)\nRank\nMarkets are sorted by average returns, from low to high25\n24\n23\n2221 20 19 18\n1716 15\n1413 12\n11 1098 765 4\n2\n124\n23\n2221 20\n191817\n16151413 1211109 87 6543\n21Developed+World\nEmerging  1 Greece Taiwan \n  2 Ireland Jordan \n  3 Finland Malaysia \n  4 U.S. Morocco \n  5 Italy Poland \n  6 Japan Hungary \n  7 Belgium Philippines \n  8 Portugal Mexico \n  9 France Argentina\n10 U.K. Korea\n11 Netherlands China\n12 Israel Chile\n13 Germany Russia\n14 Switzerland India\n15 Hong Kong South Africa\n16 Spain Turkey\n17 Austria Sri Lanka\n18 Sweden Pakistan\n19 New Zealand Thailand\n20 Denmark Czech Republic\n21 Canada Brazil\n22 Singapore Egypt\n23 Australia Peru\n24 Norway Indonesia\n25 ColombiaRank Developed Emerging Rank Legend\n3\n5 The decline of the U.S dollar has so far been sporadically interrupted by international crises.

Recall that \nU.S. investors can achieve such returns by hedging the currencies of the country portfolios \nin which they invest.   \n  Is Exchange Rate Risk Important in International Portfolios? \n  Table\u00a0 25.3  revealed that changes in exchange rates vary widely across country pairs. \nIn  Figures\u00a025.7  to 25.10 we compare results for SD, beta coefficients, average excess \nreturn, and information ratios for both developed and emerging markets using dollar and \n local-currency returns.  Figures\u00a025.7  and  25.8  look at the issue of risk. Both measures \nshow that returns in local currency are convincingly less risky than dollar-denominated \nreturns. The difference (at least over the recent 10 years) is greater when comparing \nbeta. Remember, however, that this result applies only to adding one country to the U.S. \nportfolio; relative contributions to risk could change if one were to consider broader \ndiversification.   \n Hedging currency risk when investing internationally is often undertaken to reduce \noverall portfolio risk. However, the decision of whether to hedge foreign currencies in \nan internationally diversified portfolio can also be made as part of active management. If \na portfolio manager believes the U.S. dollar is overvalued against a given currency, then \nhedging the exposure to that currency would, if correct, enhance the portfolio return in U.S. \ndollars. The potential gain from this decision depends on the weight of that currency in the \noverall portfolio. Such a decision applied to investments in only one country would have a \nsmall effect on overall risk. But what if the manager estimates that the dollar is generally \novervalued against most or all currencies? In this case, hedging the entire exposure would \nconstitute a bet with significant effect on total risk. At the same time, if the decision is \ncorrect, such a large position can provide handsome gains. \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   903bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   903 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n9 0 4 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n Figure 25.8 Market beta against U.S. using dollar-denominated and local-currency excess returns, 2002\u20132011  \n123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748\n12\n345\n678\n910\n111213\n14\n151617\n181920\n2122\n23\n2425\n2627\n2829\n3031323334353637\n38394041\n42434445\n46\n4748\n00.10.30.50.70.91.11.31.51.7\n51 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0Beta of Dollar-Denominated and\n Local-Currency Excess Returns\nRank\nBetas are ranked from low to highBeta for Local CurrencyBeta for U.S. $Rank Country Rank CountryRank Legend\n  1 Pakistan  27 Indonesia \n  2 Jordan  28 Australia \n  3 Morocco  29 India \n  4 Sri Lanka  30 Mexico \n  5 Japan  31 Italy \n  6 Malaysia  32 Belgium \n  7 Philippines  33 Spain \n  8 Switzerland  34 France \n  9 Israel  35 Ireland\n10 Egypt  36 Netherlands\n11 New Zealand  37 Russia\n12 Chile  38 Korea\n13 Hong Kong  39 Austria\n14 U.K.  40 Greece\n15 Colombia  41 Finland\n16 Thailand  42 Sweden\n17 Argentina   43 Germany\n18 Portugal  44 Norway\n19 Czech Republic  45 Hungary\n20 Peru  46 Poland\n21 Singapore  47 Brazil\n22 China  48 Turkey\n23 Denmark\n24 Canada\n25 Taiwan\n26 South Africa\n  Figures\u00a0 25.9  and  25.10  show that dollar-denominated average excess returns and \ninformation ratios are a bit better than those denominated in local currencies.

First, notice the strong trend \nof increasing correlation. Of the 16 countries, only four show stable correlation from the \nlate 1960s through 2011. The rest show significant increases. In the most recent decade, \nthe correlation of the portfolio of tradeable world country portfolios excluding the U.S. \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   905bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   905 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n9 0 6 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nwith that of the U.S. is .90 (see also the nearby box). Hence, the benefits of diversification \ncan be expected to emanate from countries with relatively lower correlations (admittedly, \namong themselves, as well as with the U.S.).  Table\u00a025.9 B shows that such low correlations \nare found mostly in the emerging markets.  \n To assess the value of international diversification, we return to  Table\u00a025.9 A, where \nwe first viewed portfolio standard deviation. We find that whether we diversify from \nU.S.-only investments either to the entire world or to emerging markets only, the stan-\ndard deviation of the portfolio increases. This results from higher standard deviations \nof foreign markets that are not offset by the relatively low correlations of emerging \nmarkets. \n Nevertheless, the objective of diversification is  not  merely risk reduction. Rather, it \nis to increase the Sharpe ratio. Here we see that, in any configuration, the Sharpe ratio \nof internationally diversified portfolios is higher than that of the U.S. alone. Even with-\nout any notion about emerging versus developed markets, holding the world portfolio \nresults in a significantly higher Sharpe ratio. Using the more revealing  M2  measure (see \nChapter 24), the advantage of the world countries portfolio amounts to 284 basis points \nannually. Even the less diversified world ETF portfolio earned an annual risk-adjusted \npremium of 107 basis points. \n Thus the data clearly indicate that despite increasing correlations, even a passive \nstrategy of holding a world ETF is still superior to the U.S.-only portfolio.

These benefits \naccrue not from reduction in standard devia-\ntion but rather from improved risk-adjusted \nperformance.    \n  Misleading Representation \nof\u00a0Diversification Benefits \n The baseline technique for constructing effi-\ncient portfolios is the efficient frontier. A useful \nefficient frontier is constructed from  expected\nreturns and an estimate of the covariance matrix \nof returns. This frontier combined with cash \nassets generates the capital allocation line, the \nset of efficient complete portfolios, as elabo-\nrated in Chapter 7. The benefit from this effi-\ncient diversification is reflected in the curvature \nof the efficient frontier. Other things equal, the \nlower the covariance across stocks, the greater \nthe curvature of the efficient frontier and \nthe greater the risk reduction for any desired \nexpected   return. So far, so good. But suppose \nwe replace  expected   returns with  realized   aver-\nage returns from a sample period to construct \nan efficient frontier; what is the possible use of \nthis graph? \n The ex post efficient frontier (derived from \nrealized returns) describes the portfolio of only \none investor\u2014the clairvoyant who actually predicted the precise averages of realized \nreturns on all assets and estimated a covariance matrix that materialized, precisely, in the   Investors\u2019 Challenge: Markets Seem Too Linked \n It\u2019s one of the golden rules of investing: Reduce risk by \ndiversifying your money into a variety of holdings\u2014stock \nfunds, bonds, commodities\u2014that don\u2019t move in lockstep \nwith one another. And it\u2019s a rule that\u2019s getting tougher \nto obey. \n According to recent research, an array of investments \nwhose prices used to rise and fall independently are now \nincreasingly correlated. For an example, look no fur-\nther than the roller coaster in emerging-markets stocks \nof recent weeks. The MSCI EAFE index, which measures \nemerging markets, now shows .96 correlation to the S&P, \nup from just .32 six years ago. \n For investors, that poses a troubling issue: how to main-\ntain a portfolio diversified enough so all the pieces don\u2019t \ntank at once. \n The current correlation trend doesn\u2019t mean investors \nshould go out and ditch their existing investments. It\u2019s just \nthat they may not be \u201cgetting the same diversification\u201d they thought if the investment decisions were made \nsome time ago, says Mr. Ezrati, chief economist at money-\nmanagement firm Lord Abbett & Co. He adds that over \nlong periods of time, going back decades, sometimes \nvaried asset classes tend to converge. \n One explanation for today\u2019s higher correlation is \nincreased globalization, which has made the economies \nof various countries more interdependent. International \nstocks, even with their higher correlations at present, \ndeserve some allocation in a long-term investor\u2019s hold-\nings, says Jeff Tjornehoj, an analyst at data firm Lipper Inc. \nMr. Tjornehoj is among those who believe these correla-\ntions are a temporary phenomenon, and expects that the \ndiversity will return some time down the line\u2014a year or \nfew years.  \nSource:   Shefali Anand, \u201cInvestors Challenge: Markets Seem Too \nLinked,\u201d  The Wall Street Journal,   June 2, 2006, p.

Obviously, we are talking \nabout a slim to empty set of investors. For all other, less-than-clairvoyant investors, such a \nfrontier may have value only for purposes of performance evaluation. \n In the world of volatile stocks, some stocks are bound to realize large,  unexpected\naverage returns. This will be reflected in ex post efficient frontiers of enormous apparent \n\u201cpotential.\u201d They will, however, suggest exaggerated diversification benefits. Such (elu-\nsive) potential was enumerated in Chapter 24 on performance evaluation. It has no mean-\ning as a tool to discuss the potential for future investments for real-life investors.  \n  Realistic Benefits from International Diversification \n While recent realized returns can be highly misleading estimates of expected future returns, \nthey are more useful for measuring prospective risk. There are two compelling reasons for \nthis. First, market efficiency (or even near efficiency) implies that stock prices will be \ndifficult to predict with any accuracy, but no such implication applies to risk measures. \nSecond, it is a statistical fact that errors in estimates of standard deviation and correlation \nfrom realized data are of a lower order of magnitude than estimates of expected returns. \nFor these reasons, using risk estimates from realized returns does not bias assessments of \nthe potential benefits from diversification. \n  Figure\u00a025.12  shows the efficient frontier using realized average monthly returns on the \nstock indexes of the 25 developed countries, with and without short sales. Even when \nthe (ex post) efficient frontier is constrained to preclude short sales, it greatly exagger-\nates the benefits from diversification. Unfortunately, such misleading efficient frontiers are \nstill presented in articles and texts on the benefits of diversification.  \n A more realistic description of diversification is achievable only when we input rea-\nsonable equilibrium expected returns. Absent superior information, such expected returns \nare best based on appropriate risk measures of the assets. The capital asset pricing model \n(CAPM) suggests using the beta of the stock against the world portfolio.

We obtain the expected excess return on each asset \nby multiplying the beta of the asset by the world portfolio expected excess return. This \nprocedure presupposes that the world portfolio will lie on the efficient frontier, at the point \nof tangency with the world capital market line. The curvature of the efficient frontier will \nnot be affected by the estimate of the world portfolio excess return. A higher estimate will \nsimply shift the curve upward. \n We perform this procedure with risk measures estimated from actual returns and further \nimpose the likely applicable constraint on short sales. We use the betas to compute the \nexpected return on individual markets, assuming the expected excess return on the world \nportfolio is .6% per month. This excess return is in line with the average return over the \nprevious 50 years. Varying this estimate would not qualitatively affect the results shown \nin  Figure\u00a025.13  (which is drawn on the same scale as  Figure\u00a025.12 ). The figure shows a \nrealistic assessment that reveals modest but significant benefits from international diver-\nsification using only developed markets. Incorporating emerging markets would further \nincrease these benefits.   \n  Are Benefits from International Diversification \nPreserved in Bear Markets? \n Some studies suggest that correlation in country portfolio returns increases during peri-\nods of turbulence in capital markets.  6   If so, benefits from diversification would be lost \n  6 F.

For example, a study by Roll of the crash of \nOctober 1987 shows that all 23 country indexes studied declined over the crash period \nof October 12\u201326.  7   This correlation is reflected in the movements of regional indexes \ndepicted in   Figure\u00a025.14 . Roll found that the beta of a country index on the world index \n(estimated prior to the crash) was the best predictor of that index\u2019s response to the \nOctober crash of the U.S. stock market. This suggests a common factor underlying the \nmovement of stocks around the world. This model predicts that a macroeconomic shock \nwould affect all countries and that diversification can only mitigate country-specific \nevents.    \n The 2008 crash of stock markets around the world allows us to test Roll\u2019s prediction. \nThe data in  Figure\u00a0 25.15  include average monthly rates of return for both the 10-year \nperiod 1999\u20132008 and the crisis period corresponding to the last 4 months of 2008, as well \nas the beta on the U.S. market and monthly standard deviation for several portfolios.

Their objective is \nto maximize diversification with limited expense and effort. Passive investment is simple: \nRely on market efficiency to guarantee that a broad stock portfolio will yield the best pos-\nsible Sharpe ratio. Estimate the mean and standard deviation of the optimal risky portfolio, \nand select a capital allocation to achieve the highest expected return at a level of risk you \nare willing to bear. But now, a passive investor must also decide whether to add an interna-\ntional component to the more convenient home-country index portfolio. \n Suppose the passive investor could rely on efficient markets as well as a world \nCAPM. Then the world capitalization\u2013weighted portfolio would be optimal. Abiding \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   911bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   911 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n912 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nby this theoretically simple solution is also practical. A world index fund would do \nthe trick. Over the decade ending in 2011, the performance of the world portfolio and that of a U.S.-only portfolio can be summarized (using statistics from  Table\u00a025.9 ) as follows: \nPortfolio World U.S. Only\nAverage monthly return (%) .31 .21\nStandard deviation (%) 4.90 4.63\n These results are instructive. First, we see that U.S. stocks make for a relatively low-risk portfolio. While the U.S. portfolio may lie inside the world efficient frontier, and thus may offer a lower Sharpe ratio than the world portfolio, it nevertheless may have lower volatil-ity than the better-diversified world portfolio. \n Things are more complicated when we recognize that the data do not support the \nvalidity of the world CAPM, and hence we cannot be certain that the world portfolio is the most efficient risky portfolio. We do observe that higher country standard devia-tions tend to be rewarded with higher average returns. A passive investor may therefore wish to examine simple rules of thumb for including a small number of countries (via international index funds of various combinations) in an attempt to dull the effect of high individual-country standard deviations and yet improve the Sharpe ratio of the overall portfolio. In all three of these rules, we assume the perspective of a U.S. investor, using dollar-denominated returns. We include countries on the basis of market capitalization for two reasons: (1) the resultant portfolio will be at least reasonably close to the theo-retically efficient portfolio, and (2) the weights of any foreign country will not be too large. We estimate the risk of progressively more diversified portfolios relative to the number of foreign countries included, and the total portfolio weight of the international component. \n The three rules of thumb are to include country indexes in order of:\n    1 .   Market capitalization (from high to low).  This rule is motivated by a world CAPM \nconsideration in which the optimal portfolio is capitalization weighted.  \n   2.  Beta against the U.S. (from low to high).  This rule concentrates on diversifying the \nrisk associated with investments in higher-risk countries.  \n   3 .   Country index standard deviation (from high to low).  This rule is motivated \nby the observation that higher country standard deviations (SDs) are correlated \nwith higher average returns. It relies on diversification to mitigate individual-country risk.    \n These alternatives illustrate the potential risks and rewards of international diversifi-\ncation. Results of this exercise appear in  Table\u00a025.11  and  Figure\u00a025.16 . First turn to panel A of  Figure\u00a025.16 , which vividly shows how portfolio SD progresses as we diversify the U.S. portfolio using the three rules. Clearly, adding countries in order of beta (or covari-ance with the U.S. market), from low to high, quickly reduces portfolio risk despite the fact that the standard deviations of all 12 included countries are higher than those of the U.S. However, once we have adequate diversification, adding these higher-volatility indexes eventually begins to increase portfolio standard deviation. Adding countries in order of standard deviation (but this time, from high to low to improve expected returns, which are correlated with volatility) incurs the greatest increase in portfolio SD, as we would expect.   \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   912bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   912 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n913\n  Portfolio Composition    Weight in World Portfolio    Weight of U.S. in Portfolio    Std Dev    Average Return  \n  A.

Average returns also increase with beta, at least for low-beta countries, \nsuggesting that at a qualitative level, world-systematic risk affects asset pricing, consistent \nwith an international CAPM. \n Broadly speaking, these results are consistent with logic of the previous chapters. First, \ndiversification pays, and risk is rewarded. Second, even with strong home-country bias, \n Figure 25.16 Risks and rewards of international portfolios, 2000\u20132009.  \nPanel A,   Standard deviations for international portfolios;  Panel B,   Average return \nof international portfolios. \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   915bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   915 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n916 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\ncovariance risk still plays a role internationally. We also see that when confined to domes-\ntic markets, risk aversion across the world is not too different: Higher country standard deviations match up with higher average returns. \n In panel D of  Table\u00a025.11 , we examine risk and reward from fuller international diversi-\nfication. Observe first that an equally weighted portfolio of all countries is the riskiest in the group. At the same time, because this portfolio assigns much larger weights to the smaller, high-volatility\u2013high-return countries, it also provides a higher average return. At the other extreme, consider the minimum-variance portfolios, with and without short-sale constraints. Without the short-sale restriction, the minimum-variance portfolio attains the amazingly low SD of 2.21%, less than half that of the lowest-SD country (the U.S.). However, this portfolio is probably not practical, including 22 short positions, the largest being  2 15% (in Sweden). \nWhen short sales are disallowed, the minimum SD is far higher, 4.14%, offering much less improvement over the capitalization-weighted portfolio. Moreover, these portfolio weights also would be impractical, with the largest weight in Malaysia (29%), and only 7% in the U.S. \n One puzzling and instructive feature of the results in  Table\u00a025.11  is the lower average \nreturn on the actual world portfolio (ACWI) compared with the 44-country portfolios. The difference arises because MSCI country-index portfolios are not capitalization-weighted portfolios. MSCI uses industry-weighted portfolios, which places greater weights on the larger stocks in each country. Since small stocks performed better over 2000\u20132009, the ACWI portfolio had a lower average return. This pattern is not guaranteed, or necessarily even likely, to apply to future returns.   \n   25.5 International Investing and \nPerformance Attribution \n  The benefits from international diversification may be modest for passive investors, but for \nactive managers international investing offers greater opportunities. International investing calls for specialization in additional fields of analysis: currency, country and worldwide industry, as well as a greater universe for stock selection.  \n   Constructing a Benchmark Portfolio of Foreign Assets \n Active international investing, as well as passive, requires a benchmark portfolio (the bogey). One widely used index of non-U.S. stocks is the    European, Australasia, Far \nEast (EAFE) index    computed by Morgan Stanley. Additional indexes of world equity \nperformance are published by Capital International Indices, Salomon Brothers, Credit Suisse First Boston, and Goldman Sachs. Portfolios designed to mirror or even replicate the country, currency, and company representation of these indexes would be the obvious generalization of the purely domestic passive equity strategy. \n An issue that sometimes arises in the international context is the appropriateness of \nmarket-capitalization weighting schemes in the construction of international indexes. Capitalization weighting is far and away the most common approach. However, some argue that it might not be the best weighting scheme in an international context. This is in part because different countries have differing proportions of their corporate sector orga-nized as publicly traded firms. \n  Table\u00a025.12  shows 1998 and 2011 data for market-capitalization weights versus GDP \nweights for countries in the EAFE index. These data reveal substantial disparities between \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   916bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   916 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 25 International Diversification 917\n    2011    1998  \n  Country    % of EAFE Market \nCapitalization    % of EAFE GDP    % of EAFE Market \nCapitalization    % of EAFE GDP  \n Japan  21.1%  23.7%  26.8%  29.1% \n United Kingdom  17.9  9.8  22.4  10.5 \n France  9.3  11.1  7.2  10.7 \n Germany  7.5  14.2  8.9  15.8 \n Switzerland  6.8  2.3  6.0  1.9 \n Italy  2.9  8.9  3.9  8.8 \n Netherlands  2.4  3.4  5.9  2.9 \n Hong Kong  8.8  1.0  4.0  1.2 \n Australia  6.7  4.0  2.9  2.7 \n Spain  3.5  6.1  2.7  4.3 \n Sweden  2.8  2.0  2.4  1.8 \n Finland  0.9  1.0  0.7  1.0 \n Belgium  1.4  2.0  1.4  1.8 \n Singapore  2.7  0.9  1.1  0.6 \n Denmark  1.1  1.3  0.9  1.3 \n Norway  1.5  1.8  0.6  1.1 \n Ireland  0.4  0.9  0.5  0.6 \n Greece  0.2  1.3  0.3  0.9 \n Portugal  0.4  1.0  0.6  0.8 \n Austria  0.5  1.6  0.4  1.6 \n New Zealand  0.2  0.6  0.4  0.4 \n Table 25.12 \n Weighting schemes for EAFE countries \n Source: Datastream,   online.thomsonreuters.com/datastream   .  \nthe relative sizes of market capitalization and GDP. Since market capitalization is a stock \nfigure (the value of equity at one point in time), while GDP is a flow figure (production \nof goods and services during the entire year), we expect capitalization to be more volatile \nand the relative shares to be more variable over time. Some discrepancies are persistent, \nhowever. For example, Hong Kong\u2019s share of capitalization in 2011 is about eight times its \nshare of GDP, while Germany\u2019s share of capitalization is much less than its share of GDP. \nThese disparities indicate that a greater proportion of economic activity is conducted by \npublicly traded firms in Hong Kong than in Germany.  \n Some argue that it would be more appropriate to weight international indexes by GDP \nrather than market capitalization. The justification for this view is that an internationally \ndiversified portfolio should purchase shares in proportion to the broad asset base of each \ncountry, and GDP might be a better measure of the importance of a country in the inter-\nnational economy than the value of its outstanding stocks. Others have even suggested \nweights proportional to the import share of various countries. The argument is that inves-\ntors who wish to hedge the price of imported goods might choose to hold securities in \nforeign firms in proportion to the goods imported from those countries.   \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   917bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   917 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n918  International Investing Raises Questions \n As Yogi Berra might say, the problem with international \ninvesting is that it\u2019s so darn foreign. \n Currency swings? Hedging? International diversifica-\ntion? What\u2019s that? \n Here are answers to five questions that I\u2019m often asked:\n    \u2022  Foreign stocks account for some 60% of world stock \nmarket value, so shouldn\u2019t you have 60% of your stock market money overseas?    \n The main reason to invest abroad isn\u2019t to replicate the \nglobal market or to boost returns. Instead, \u201cwhat we\u2019re \ntrying to do by adding foreign stocks is to reduce volatil-ity,\u201d explains Robert Ludwig, chief investment officer at money manager SEI Investments. \n Foreign stocks don\u2019t move in sync with U.S. shares and, \nthus, they may provide offsetting gains when the U.S. mar-\nket is falling. But to get the resulting risk reduction, you don\u2019t need anything like 60% of your money abroad. \n    \u2022  So, how much foreign exposure do you need to get \ndecent diversification?   \n \u201cBased on the volatility of foreign markets and the cor-\nrelation between markets, we think an optimal portfolio \nis 70% in the U.S., 20% in developed foreign markets, and 10% in emerging markets,\u201d Mr. Ludwig says. \n Even with a third of your stock market money in foreign \nissues, you may find that the risk-reduction benefits aren\u2019t \nall that reliable. Unfortunately, when U.S. stocks get really pounded, it seems foreign shares also tend to tumble. \n    \u2022  Can U.S. companies with global operations give you \ninternational diversification?   \n \u201cWhen you look at these multinationals, the factor that \ndrives their performance is their home market,\u201d says Mark \nRiepe, a vice president with Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago research firm. \n How come? U.S. multinationals tend to be owned by \nU.S. investors, who will be swayed by the ups and downs \nof the U.S. market. In addition, Mr. Riepe notes that while multinationals may derive substantial profits and revenue abroad, most of their costs\u2014especially labor costs\u2014will be incurred in the U.S.     \u2022  Does international diversification come from the for-eign stocks or the foreign currency?   \n \u201cIt comes from both in roughly equal pieces,\u201d Mr. Riepe \nsays. \u201cThose who choose to hedge their foreign currency \nraise the correlation with U.S. stocks, and so the diversifica-tion benefit won\u2019t be nearly as great.\u201d \n Indeed, you may want to think twice before investing \nin a foreign-stock fund that frequently hedges its currency \nexposure in an effort to mute the impact of\u2014and make money from\u2014changes in foreign-exchange rates. \n \u201cThe studies that we\u2019ve done show that stock managers \nhave hurt themselves more than they\u2019ve helped themselves \nby actively managing currencies,\u201d Mr. Ludwig says. \n    \u2022  Should you divvy up your money among foreign coun-\ntries depending on the size of each national stock market?   \n At issue is the nagging question of how much to put in \nJapan. If you replicated the market weightings of Morgan \nStanley Capital International\u2019s Europe, Australasia and Far East index, you would currently have around a third of your overseas money in Japan. \n That\u2019s the sort of weighting you find in interna-\ntional funds, which seek to track the performance of the \nEAFE or similar international indexes. Actively managed foreign-stock funds, by contrast, pay less attention to market weights and on average, these days have just 14% in Japan. \n If your focus is risk reduction rather than performance, \nthe index\u2014and the funds that track it\u2014are the clear win-\nners. Japan performs quite unlike the U.S. market, so it provides good diversification for U.S. investors, says Tricia Rothschild, international editor at Morningstar Mutual Funds, a Chicago newsletter. \n \u201cBut correlations aren\u2019t static,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere\u2019s \nalways a problem with taking what happened over the \npast 20 years and projecting it out over the next 20 years.\u201d  \n  Source:  Jonathan Clements, \u201cInternational Investing Raises \nQuestions on Allocation, Diversification, Hedging,\u201d  The Wall Street \nJournal,  July 29, 1997.

Currency selection    measures the contribution to total portfolio performance attrib-\nutable to exchange rate fluctuations relative to the investor\u2019s benchmark currency, which we will take to be the U.S. dollar. We might use a benchmark like the EAFE index to compare a portfolio\u2019s currency selection for a particular period to a passive benchmark. EAFE currency selection would be computed as the weighted average of the currency appreciation of the currencies represented in the EAFE portfolio using as weights the fraction of the EAFE portfolio invested in each currency.  \nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   918bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   918 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n  eXcel  APPLICATIONS:    International Portfolios \n  T his Excel model provides an efficient frontier analysis \nsimilar to that in Chapter 6.

Country selection    measures the contribution to performance attributable to invest-\ning in the better-performing stock markets of the world. It can be measured as the \nweighted average of the equity  index  returns of each country using as weights the \nshare of the manager\u2019s portfolio in each country. We use index returns to abstract from the effect of security selection within countries. To measure a manager\u2019s contribution relative to a passive strategy, we might compare country selection to the weighted average across countries of equity index returns using as weights the share of the EAFE portfolio in each country.  \n   3.    Stock selection    ability may, as in Chapter 24, be measured as the weighted aver-\nage of equity returns  in excess of the equity index  in each country. Here, we would \nuse local currency returns and use as weights the investments in each country.  \n   4.    Cash/bond selection    may be measured as the \nexcess return derived from weighting bonds and bills differently from some benchmark weights.    \n \n  Table\u00a025.13  gives an example of how to measure the \ncontribution of the decisions an international portfolio manager might make.      Using the data in  Table\u00a025.13 , compute the man-\nager\u2019s country and currency selection if portfo-\nlio weights had been 40% in Europe, 20% in Australia, and 40% in the Far East.

The Windsor Foundation, a U.S.-based, not-for-profit charitable organization, has a diversified \ninvestment portfolio of $100 million. Windsor\u2019s board of directors is considering an initial invest-ment in emerging market equities. Robert Houston, treasurer of the foundation, has made the following four comments:\n     a .   \u201cFor an investor holding only developed market equities, the existence of stable emerging \nmarket currencies is one of several preconditions necessary for that investor to realize strong emerging market performance.\u201d  \n    b .   \u201cLocal currency depreciation against the dollar has been a frequent occurrence for U.S. inves-tors in emerging markets. U.S. investors have consistently seen large percentages of their returns erased by currency depreciation. This is true even for long-term investors.\u201d  \n    c.  \u201cHistorically, the addition of emerging market stocks to a U.S. equity portfolio such as the S&P 500 index has reduced volatility; volatility has also been reduced when emerging market stocks are combined with an international portfolio such as the MSCI EAFE index.\u201d  \n    d .   \u201cAlthough correlations among emerging markets can change over the short term, such correla-tions show evidence of stability over the long term. Thus, an emerging markets portfolio that lies on the efficient frontier in one period tends to remain close to the frontier in subsequent periods.\u201d    \n   Discuss whether  each  of Houston\u2019s four comments is correct or incorrect.  \n   8. After much research on the developing economy and capital markets of the country of Otunia, \nyour firm, GAC, has decided to include an investment in the Otunia stock market in its Emerging Markets Commingled Fund. However, GAC has not yet decided whether to invest actively or by indexing. Your opinion on the active versus indexing decision has been solicited. The following is a summary of the research findings:\nbod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   923bod61671_ch25_882-925.indd   923 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm924 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  Otunia\u2019s economy is fairly well diversified across agricultural and natural \nresources, manufacturing (both consumer and durable goods), and a grow-ing finance sector. Transaction costs in securities markets are relatively large in Otunia because of high commissions and government \u201cstamp taxes\u201d on securi-ties trades. Accounting standards and disclosure regulations are quite detailed, resulting in wide public availability of reliable information about companies\u2019 financial performance. \n Capital flows into and out of Otunia, and foreign ownership of Otunia secu-\nrities is strictly regulated by an agency of the national government. The settle-\nment procedures under these ownership rules often cause long delays in settling trades made by nonresidents. Senior finance officials in the government are working to deregulate capital flows and foreign ownership, but GAC\u2019s political consultant believes that isolationist sentiment may prevent much real progress in the short run.  \n     a .   Briefly discuss aspects of the Otunia environment that favor investing actively, and aspects that favor indexing.  \n    b .   Recommend whether GAC should invest in Otunia actively or by indexing. Justify your rec-ommendation based on the factors identified in part ( a ) .        \n E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES \n A common misconception is that investors can earn excess returns by investing in foreign \nbonds with higher interest rates than are available in the U.S. Interest rate parity implies that any such interest rate differentials will be offset by premiums or discounts in the for-ward or futures market for foreign currency. \n Interest rates on government bonds in the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany, Brazil, and \nAustralia can be found at   www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html   .  \n Spot exchange rates on international currencies can be found at   www.bloomberg.\ncom/markets/currencies/fxc.html   .  \n Forward exchange rates on currency futures contracts can be found at   www.cmegroup.\ncom/trading/fx/index.html   .  \n    1. Select one of these countries and record the yield on a short-term government security \nfrom the Bloomberg Web site. Also make note of the U.S. Treasury yield on an instru-\nment with the same maturity.  \n   2. Record the spot exchange rate from the Bloomberg site and the futures contract \nexchange rate from the CME Web site for the date closest to the maturity of the invest-ment you chose in the previous step.  \n   3. Calculate the rate of return available on the foreign government security, converting the \nforeign currency transactions into dollars at the current and forward exchange rates.  \n   4. How well does interest rate parity seem to hold? Are there bargains to be found in \nother currencies?

Like mutual funds, hedge funds allow private investors to pool assets to be invested by a fund manager. Unlike mutual funds, however, they are commonly organized as private partnerships and thus not subject to many SEC regulations. They typically are open only to wealthy or institutional investors. \n Hedge funds touch on virtually every \nissue discussed in the earlier chapters of the \ntext, including liquidity, security analysis, market efficiency, portfolio analysis, hedg-ing, and option pricing. For example, these funds often bet on relative mispricing of specific securities, but hedge broad market exposure. This sort of pure \u201calpha seeking\u201d behavior requires a procedure for optimally mixing a hedge fund position with a more traditional portfolio. Other funds engage in aggressive market timing; their risk profiles can shift rapidly and substantially, raising dif-ficult questions for performance evaluation. Many hedge funds take extensive deriva-tives positions. Even those funds that do not trade derivatives charge incentive fees that resemble the payoff to a call option; an option-pricing background therefore is neces-sary to interpret both hedge fund strategies and costs. In short, hedge funds raise the full range of issues that one might confront in active portfolio management. \n We begin with a survey of various hedge \nfund orientations. We devote considerable \nattention to the classic \u201cmarket-neutral\u201d or hedged strategies that historically gave hedge funds their name. We move on to evidence on hedge fund performance, and the difficul-ties in evaluating that performance. Finally, we consider the implications of their unusual fee structure for investors in and managers of such funds.

Investors \nbuy shares in these funds, which then invest the pooled assets on their behalf. The net \nasset value of each share represents the value of the investor\u2019s stake in the portfolio. In this regard, hedge funds operate much like mutual funds. However, there are important differ-ences between the two.  \n       \n  Transparency   Mutual funds are subject to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Invest-\nment Company Act of 1940 (designed to protect unsophisticated investors), which require transparency and predictability of strategy. They periodically must provide the public with information on portfolio composition. In contrast, hedge funds usually are set up as limited liability partnerships, and provide minimal information about portfolio composition and strategy to their investors only.  \n  Investors   Hedge funds traditionally have no more than 100 \u201csophisticated\u201d investors, \nin practice usually defined by minimum net worth and income requirements. They gener-ally do not advertise to the general public, and minimum investments usually are between $250,000 and $1 million.  \n  Investment Strategies   Mutual funds lay out their general investment approach (e.g., \nlarge, value stock orientation versus small-cap growth orientation) in their prospectus. They \nface pressure to avoid  style drift  (departures from their stated investment orientation), espe-\ncially given the importance of retirement funds such as 401(k) plans to the industry, and the demand of such plans for predictable strategies. Most mutual funds promise to limit their use of short-selling and leverage, and their use of derivatives is highly restricted. In recent years, some so-called 130/30 mutual funds  \n1   have opened, primarily for institutional clients, \nwith prospectuses that explicitly allow for more active short-selling and derivatives posi-tions, but even these have less flexibility than hedge funds. In contrast, hedge funds may effectively partake in any investment strategy and may act opportunistically as conditions evolve. For this reason, viewing hedge funds as anything remotely like a uniform asset class would be a mistake. Hedge funds by design are empowered to invest in a wide range of investments, with various funds focusing on derivatives, distressed firms, currency specula-tion, convertible bonds, emerging markets, merger arbitrage, and so on. Other funds may jump from one asset class to another as perceived investment opportunities shift.\n   \n  Liquidity   Hedge funds often impose    lock-up periods,      that is, periods as long as several \nyears in which investments cannot be withdrawn. Many also employ redemption notices that require investors to provide notice weeks or months in advance of their desire to redeem funds. These restrictions limit the liquidity of investors but in turn enable the funds to invest in illiquid assets where returns may be higher, without worrying about meeting unanticipated demands for redemptions.  \n  Compensation Structure   Hedge funds also differ from mutual funds in their fee struc-\nture. Whereas mutual funds assess management fees equal to a fixed percentage of assets, \nfor example, between .5% and 1.5% annually for typical equity funds, hedge funds charge a management fee, usually between 1% and 2% of assets,  plus  a substantial  incentive fee      26.1 Hedge Funds versus Mutual Funds  \n  1 These are funds that may sell short up to 30% of the value of their portfolios, using the proceeds of the sale to \nincrease their positions in invested assets. So for every $100 in net assets, the fund could sell short $30, investing \nthe proceeds to increase its long positions to $130. This gives rise to the 130/30 moniker. \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   927bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   927 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n9 2 8 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nequal to a fraction of any investment profits beyond some benchmark. The incentive fee \nis often 20%. The threshold return to earn the incentive fee is often a money market rate \nsuch as LIBOR. Indeed, some observers only half-jokingly characterize hedge funds as \u201ca \ncompensation scheme masquerading as an asset class.\u201d      \nConvertible arbitrage Hedged investing in convertible securities, typically long convertible bonds and short stock.\nDedicated short bias Net short position, usually in equities, as opposed to pure short exposure.\nEmerging markets Goal is to exploit market inefficiencies in emerging markets. Typically long-only \nbecause short-selling is not feasible in many of these markets.\nEquity market neutral Commonly uses long/short hedges.

Commonly involves leverage.\nEvent driven Attempts to profit from situations such as mergers, acquisitions, restructuring, \nbankruptcy, or reorganization.\nFixed-income arbitrage Attempts to profit from price anomalies in related interest rate securities. Includes \ninterest rate swap arbitrage, U.S. versus non-U.S. government bond arbitrage, \nyield-curve arbitrage, and mortgage-backed arbitrage.\nGlobal macro Involves long and short positions in capital or derivative markets across the world. Port-\nfolio positions reflect views on broad market conditions and major economic trends.\nLong/short equity hedge Equity-oriented positions on either side of the market (i.e., long or short), depend-\ning on outlook. Not meant to be market neutral. May establish a concentrated focus \nregionally (e.g., U.S. or Europe) or on a specific sector (e.g., tech or health care \nstocks). Derivatives may be used to hedge positions.\nManaged futures Uses financial, currency, or commodity futures. May make use of technical \ntrading rules or a less structured judgmental approach.\nMultistrategy Opportunistic choice of strategy depending on outlook.\nFund of funds Fund allocates its cash to several other hedge funds to be managed.\n Table 26.1 \n Hedge fund styles \n CS/TASS (Credit Suisse/Tremont Advisors Shareholder Services) maintains one of the most comprehensive databases on hedge fund \nperformance. It categorizes hedge funds into these 11 different investment styles.   Table\u00a026.1  lists most of the common investment themes found in the hedge fund industry. \nThe list contains a wide diversity of styles and suggests how hard it can be to speak generi-\ncally about hedge funds as a group. We can, however, divide hedge fund strategies into two \ngeneral categories: directional and nondirectional.   \n   Directional and Nondirectional Strategies \n    Directional strategies    are easy to understand. They are simply bets that one sector or \nanother will outperform other sectors of the market. \n In contrast,    nondirectional strategies    are usually designed to exploit temporary misalign-\nments in security valuations. For example, if the yield on corporate bonds seems abnormally \nhigh compared to that on Treasury bonds, the hedge fund would buy corporates and short sell    26.2 Hedge Fund Strategies  \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   928bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   928 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 26 Hedge Funds 929\nTreasury securities. Notice that the fund is  not  betting on broad movements in the entire bond \nmarket: It buys one type of bond and sells another. By taking a long corporate\u2013short Treasury \nposition, the fund hedges its interest rate exposure while making a bet on the  relative  valua-\ntion across the two sectors. The idea is that when yield spreads revert back to their \u201cnormal\u201d relationship, the fund will profit from the realignment regardless of the general trend in the level of interest rates. In this respect, it strives to be    market neutral,      or hedged with respect \nto the direction of interest rates, which gives rise to the term \u201chedge fund.\u201d \n Nondirectional strategies are sometimes further divided into  convergence  or  relative \nvalue  positions. The difference between convergence and relative value is a time horizon at which one can say with confidence that any mispricing ought to be resolved. An example of a convergence strategy would entail mispricing of a futures contract that must be cor-rected by the time the contract matures. In contrast, the corporate versus Treasury spread we just discussed would be a relative value strategy, because there is no obvious horizon during which the yield spread would \u201ccorrect\u201d from unusual levels. \n \n We can illustrate a market-neutral position with a strategy used extensively by several \nhedge funds, which observed that newly issued or \u201con-the-run\u201d 30-year Treasury bonds regularly sell at higher prices (lower yields) than 29\u00bd-year bonds with almost identi-cal duration. The yield spread presumably is a premium due to the greater liquidity of the on-the-run bonds. Hedge funds, which have relatively low liquidity needs, therefore buy the 29\u00bd-year bond and sell the 30-year bond. This is a hedged, or market-neutral, position that will generate a profit whenever the yields on the two bonds converge, as typically happens when the 30-year bonds age, are no longer the most liquid on-the-run bond, and are no longer priced at a premium. \n Notice that this strategy should generate profits regardless of the general direction of \ninterest rates. The long-short position will return a profit as long as the 30-year bonds \nunderperform the 29\u00bd-year bonds, as they should when the liquidity premium dissi-pates. Because the pricing discrepancies between these two securities almost necessarily  must  disappear at a given date, this strategy is an example of convergence arbitrage. \nWhile the convergence date in this application is not quite as definite as the maturity of \na futures contract, one can be sure that the currently on-the-run T-bonds will lose that status by the time the Treasury next issues 30-year bonds.  Example 26.1 Market-Neutral Positions \n Long-short positions such as in Example 26.1 are characteristic of hedged strategies. They \nare designed to  isolate  a bet on some mispricing without taking on market exposure. Profits \nare made regardless of broad market movements once prices \u201cconverge\u201d or return to their \n\u201cproper\u201d levels. Hence, use of short positions and derivatives is part and parcel of the industry. \n A more complex long-short strategy is  convertible bond arbitr age,  one of the more \nprominent sectors of the hedge-fund universe. Noting that a convertible bond may be viewed as a straight bond plus a call option on the underlying stock, the market-neutral strategy in this case involves a position in the bond offset by an opposite position in the stock. For example, if the convertible is viewed as underpriced, the fund will buy it and offset its resultant exposure to declines in the stock price by shorting the stock. \n Although these market-neutral positions are hedged, they are  not  risk-free arbitrage \nstrategies. Rather they should be viewed as    pure plays,      that is, bets on  particular  \n(perceived) mispricing between two sectors or securities, with extraneous sources of risk such as general market exposure hedged away. Moreover, because the funds often operate with considerable leverage, returns can be quite volatile. \n  \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   929bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   929 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n930 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  Statistical Arbitrage \n Statistical arbitrage is a version of a market-neutral strategy, but one that merits its own \ndiscussion. It differs from pure arbitrage in that it does not exploit risk-free positions based on unambiguous mispricing (such as index arbitrage). Instead, it uses quantitative and often automated trading systems that seek out many temporary and modest misalign-ments in prices among securities. By taking relatively small positions in many of these opportunities, the law of averages would make the probability of profiting from the col-lection of ostensibly positive-value bets very high, ideally almost a \u201cstatistical certainty.\u201d Of course, this strategy presumes that the fund\u2019s modeling techniques can actually identify reliable, if small, market inefficiencies. The law of averages will work for the fund only if the expected return is positive! \n Statistical arbitrage often involves trading in hundreds of securities a day with holding \nperiods that can be measured in minutes or less. Such rapid and heavy trading requires extensive use of quantitative tools such as automated trading and mathematical algorithms to identify profit opportunities and efficient diversification across positions. These strategies try to profit from the smallest of perceived mispricing opportunities, and require the fastest trading technology and the lowest possible trading costs. They would not be possible with-out the electronic communication networks discussed in Chapter 3. \n A particular form of statistical arbitrage is    pairs trading,      in which stocks are paired up \nbased on an analysis of either fundamental similarities or market exposures (betas). The gen-eral approach is to pair up similar companies whose returns are highly correlated but where one company seems to be priced more aggressively than the other.  \n2   Market-neutral positions \ncan be formed by buying the relatively cheap firm and selling the expensive one. Many such pairs comprise the hedge fund\u2019s overall portfolio. Each pair may have an uncertain outcome, but with many such matched pairs, the presumption is that the large number of long-short bets will provide a very high probability of a positive abnormal return. More general versions of pairs trading allow for positions in clusters of stocks that may be relatively mispriced.\n  \n Statistical arbitrage is commonly associated with    data mining,      which refers to sort-\ning through huge amounts of historical data to uncover systematic patterns in returns that can be exploited by traders. The risk of data mining, and statistical arbitrage in general, is that historical relationships may break down when fundamental economic conditions change or, indeed, that the apparent patterns in the data may be due to pure chance. Enough analysis applied to enough data is sure to produce apparent patterns that do not reflect real relationships that can be counted on to persist in the future.     Classify each of the following strategies as directional or nondirectional. \n     a.  The fund buys shares in the India Investment Fund, a closed-end fund that is selling at a discount to \nnet asset value, and sells the MSCI India Index Swap.  \n    b.  The fund buys shares in Petrie Stores and sells Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, which is a major component of Petrie\u2019s balance sheet.  \n    c.  The fund buys shares in Generic Pharmaceuticals betting that it will be acquired at a premium by Pfizer.    CONCEPT CHECK 26.1 \n  2 Rules for deciding relative \u201caggressiveness\u201d of pricing may vary. In one approach, a computer scans for stocks \nwhose prices historically have tracked very closely but have recently diverged. If the differential in cumulative \nreturn typically dissipates, the fund will buy the recently underperforming stock and sell the outperforming one. In other variants, pricing aggressiveness may be determined by evaluating the stocks based on some measure of price to intrinsic value. \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   930bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   930 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 26 Hedge Funds 931\n An important implication of the market-neutral pure play is the notion of    portable alpha.      \nSuppose that you wish to speculate on a stock that you think is underpriced, but you think \nthat the market is about to fall. Even if you are right about the stock being  relatively  under-\npriced, it still might decline in response to declines in the broad market. You would like to separate the stock-specific bet from the implicit asset allocation bet on market perfor-mance that arises because the stock\u2019s beta is positive. The solution is to buy the stock and eliminate the resultant market exposure by selling enough index futures to drive beta to zero. This long stock\u2013short futures strategy gives you a pure play or, equivalently, a  market-neutral  position on the stock. \n More generally, you might wish to separate asset allocation from security selection. The \nidea is to invest wherever you can \u201cfind alpha.\u201d You would then hedge the systematic risk \nof that investment to isolate its alpha from the asset market where it was found. Finally, you establish exposure to desired market sectors by using passive products such as indexed mutual funds, ETFs, or index futures. In other words, you have created portable alpha that can be mixed with an exposure to whatever sector of the market you choose. This proce-dure is also called    alpha transfer,      because you transfer alpha from the sector where you \nfind it to the asset class in which you ultimately establish exposure. Finding alpha requires skill. By contrast, beta, or market exposure, is a \u201ccommodity\u201d that can be supplied cheaply through index products and offers little value added.  \n   An Example of a Pure Play \n Suppose you manage a $1.4 million portfolio. You believe that the alpha of the portfolio is positive,  a \u00a0.\u00a00, but also that the market is about to fall, that is, that  r  \n M  \u00a0,\u00a00. You would \ntherefore try to establish a pure play on the perceived mispricing. \n The return on portfolio over the next month may be described by Equation 26.1, which \nstates that the portfolio return will equal its \u201cfair\u201d CAPM return (the first two terms on the \nright-hand side), plus firm-specific risk reflected in the \u201cresidual,\u201d  e,  plus an alpha that \nreflects perceived mispricing:\n    rportfolio5rf1b(rM2rf)1e1a  (26.1)   \n To be concrete, suppose that  b \u00a0 5 \u00a0 1.20,\u00a0  a \u00a0 5 \u00a0 .02,\u00a0  r   f  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 .01, the current value of the \nS&P 500 index is  S  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a01,344, and, for simplicity, that the portfolio pays no dividends. You \nwant to capture the positive alpha of 2% per month, but you don\u2019t want the positive beta \nthat the stock entails because you are worried about a market decline. So you choose to hedge your exposure by selling S&P 500 futures contracts. \n Because the S&P contracts have a multiplier of $250, and the portfolio has a beta of \n1.20, your stock position can be hedged for 1 month by selling five futures contracts:  \n3      \nHedge ratio 5$1,400,000\n1,3443$25031.2055 contracts     26.3 Portable Alpha  \n  3 We simplify here by assuming that the maturity of the futures contract precisely equals the hedging horizon, in \nthis case, 1 month. If the contract maturity were longer, one would have to slightly reduce the hedge ratio in a \nprocess called \u201ctailing the hedge.\u201d \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   931bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   931 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n932 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  A warning: Even market-neutral positions are still bets, and they can go wrong. This \nis not true arbitrage because your profits still depend on whether your analysis (your per-\nceived alpha) is correct. Moreover, you can be done in by simple bad luck, that is, your analysis may be correct but a bad realization of idiosyncratic risk (negative values of  e  in \nEquation 26.1 or 26.2) can still result in losses.

In other words, you have reduced beta to zero. Your investment is $1.4 million, so your total monthly rate of return is 3% plus the remain-ing nonsystematic risk (the second term of Equation 26.2). The fair or equilibrium expected rate of return on such a zero-beta position is the risk-free rate, 1%, so you have preserved your alpha of 2%, while eliminating the market exposure of the stock portfolio. \n This is an idealized example of a pure play. In particular, it simplifies by assuming a \nknown and fixed portfolio beta, but it illustrates that the goal is to speculate on the stock while hedging out the undesired market exposure. Once this is accomplished, you can establish any desired exposure to other sources of systematic risk by buying indexes or entering index futures contracts in those markets. Thus, you have made alpha portable. \n  Figure\u00a026.1  is a graphical analysis of this pure play. Panel A shows the excess returns to \nbetting on a positive-alpha stock portfolio \u201cnaked,\u201d that is, unhedged. Your  expected  return \nis better than an equilibrium return given your risk, but because of your market exposure you still can lose if the market declines. Panel B shows the characteristic line for the posi-tion with systematic risk hedged out. There is no market exposure. \n What would be the dollar value and rate of return on the market-neutral posi-\ntion if the value of the residual turns out to be  2 4%? If the market return in that \nmonth is 5%, where would the plot of the strategy return lie in each panel of \n Figure 26.1 ?

Most incidents of relative mispricing are fairly minor, and \nthe hedged nature of long-short strategies makes overall volatility low. The hedge funds \nrespond by scaling up their bets. This amplifies gains when their bets work out, but also \namplifies losses. In the end, the volatility of the funds is not small.

While the 30- versus 29\u00bd-year \nmaturity T-bond strategy (see Example 26.1) worked well over several years, it blew up \nwhen Russia defaulted on its debt, triggering massive investment demand for the safest, \nmost liquid assets that drove up the price of the 30-year Treasury relative to its 29\u00bd-year \ncounterpart. The big losses that ensued illustrate that even the safest bet\u2014one based \non convergence arbitrage\u2014carries risks. Although the T-bond spread had to converge \neventually, and in fact it did several weeks later, Long Term Capital Management and \nother hedge funds suffered large losses on their positions when the spread widened \ntemporarily. The ultimate convergence came too late for LTCM, which was also facing \nmassive losses on its other positions and had to be bailed out.  4     Example 26.2 The Risks of Pure Plays \n4 This timing problem is a common one for active managers. We saw other examples of this issue when we dis-\ncussed limits to arbitrage in Chapter 12. More generally, when security analysts think they have found a mispriced \nstock, they usually acknowledge that it is hard to know how long it will take for price to converge to intrinsic value.  While the classic hedge fund strategy may have focused on market-neutral opportunities, \nas the market has evolved, the freedom to use derivatives contracts and short positions \nmeans that hedge funds can in effect follow any investment strategy.

In these cases, the fund makes an outright bet, for example, on currency movements, the outcome of a takeover attempt, or the performance of an investment sector. These funds are most certainly not hedged, despite their name. \n In Chapter 24, we introduced you to style analysis, which uses regression analysis \nto measure the exposure of a portfolio to various factors or asset classes. The analysis thus measures the implicit asset class exposure of a portfolio. The betas on a series of factors measure the fund\u2019s exposure to each source of systematic risk. A market-neutral fund will have no sensitivity to an index for that market. In contrast, directional funds will exhibit significant betas, often called  loadings  in this context, on whatever factors \nthe fund tends to bet on. Observers attempting to measure investment style can use these factor loadings to impute exposures to a range of variables. \n We present a simple style analysis for the hedge fund indexes in  Table\u00a026.2 . The four \nsystematic factors we consider are:\n     \u2022  Interest rates: the return on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds.  \n   \u2022  Equity markets: the return on the S&P 500.  \n   \u2022  Credit conditions: the difference in the return on Baa-rated bonds over Treasury bonds.  \n   \u2022  Foreign exchange: the percentage change in the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies.   \nThe returns on hedge fund index  i  in month  t  may be statistically described by  \n5     \n Rit5ai1bi1 Factor1 t1c1bi4 Factor4 t1eit  (26.3)   \nThe betas (equivalently, factor loadings) measure the sensitivity to each factor. As usual, the residual,  e  \n it  , measures nonsystematic risk that is uncorrelated with the set of explana-\ntory factors, and the intercept,  a   i  , measures average performance of fund  i  net of the impact \nof these systematic factors. \n  Table\u00a026.2  presents factor exposure estimates for 13 hedge fund indexes. The results \nconfirm that most funds are in fact directional with very clear exposures to one or more \nof the four factors. Moreover, the estimated factor betas seem reasonable in terms of the funds\u2019 stated style. For example:\n    \u2022  The equity market\u2013neutral funds have uniformly low and statistically insignificant factor betas, as one would expect of a market-neutral posture.  \n   \u2022  Dedicated short bias funds exhibit substantial negative betas on the S&P index.  \n   \u2022  Distressed-firm funds have significant exposure to credit conditions (more positive credit spreads in this table indicate better economic conditions) as well as to the S&P 500. This exposure arises because restructuring activities often depend on access to borrowing, and successful restructuring depends on the state of the economy.  \n   \u2022  Global macro funds show negative exposure to a stronger U.S. dollar, which would make the dollar value of foreign investments less valuable.   \nWe conclude that, by and large, most hedge funds are making very explicit directional bets on a wide array of economic factors.    \n  5 This analysis differs in two important respects from style analysis for mutual funds introduced in Chapter 24. \nFirst, in this application, factor loadings are not constrained to be non-negative. This is because, unlike mutual \nfunds, hedge funds easily can take on short positions in various asset classes. Second, portfolio weights are not constrained to sum to 1.0. Again, unlike mutual funds, hedge funds can operate with considerable leverage. \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   934bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   934 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 26 Hedge Funds 935\nFund Group* Alpha S&P 500 Long T-Bond Credit Premium U.S. Dollar\nAll funds 0.0052\n3.34870.2718\n5.01130.0189\n0.30640.1755\n2.046220.1897\n22.1270\nMarket neutral 0.0014\n0.19900.1677\n0.691720.0163\n20.05890.3308\n0.863120.5097\n21.2790\nShort bias 0.0058\n1.338120.9723\n26.36840.1310\n0.75270.3890\n1.611320.2630\n21.0476\nEvent driven 0.0071\n5.11550.2335\n4.7858      0.0000\n20.00020.2056\n2.664220.1165\n0.1520\nRisk arbitrage 0.0034\n3.06780.1498\n3.86200.0130\n0.044220.0006\n20.009720.2130\n23.3394\nDistressed 0.0068\n5.76970.2080\n4.99850.0032\n0.06790.2521\n3.831820.1156\n21.6901\nEmerging markets 0.0082\n2.88670.3750\n3.74520.2624\n2.29950.4551\n2.874820.2169\n21.3173\nFixed Income 0.0018\n1.01490.1719\n2.81390.2284\n3.28060.5703\n5.903220.1714\n21.7063\nConvertible arb 0.0005\n0.21970.2477\n3.10660.2109\n2.32140.5021\n3.982520.0972\n20.7414\nGlobal macro 0.0079\n3.52170.0746\n0.94370.0593\n0.65870.1492\n1.193820.2539\n21.9533\nLong-short equity 0.0053\n2.56930.4442\n6.142520.0070\n20.08500.0672\n0.587420.1471\n21.2372\nManaged futures 0.0041\n0.88530.2565\n1.594420.2991\n21.631020.5223\n22.052820.2703\n21.0217\nMultistrategy 0.0075\n4.21800.2566\n4.128420.0048\n20.06840.1781\n1.811620.1172\n21.1471\n Table 26.2 \n Style analysis for a sample of hedge fund indexes \n  *Fund definitions are given in  Table\u00a026.1 .  \n  Note: Top line of each entry is the estimate of the factor beta.

We report for each index the beta relative to the S&P 500, the serial cor-\nrelation of returns, the Sharpe ratio, and the alpha. Betas tend to be considerably less than \none; not surprisingly, the beta of the short bias index is large and negative. The market-\nneutral index has a beta near zero.  \n By and large, hedge fund performance is impressive. Most of the alpha estimates are \npositive, and the average alpha is substantial, 0.17% per month. Similarly, most Sharpe \nratios exceed that of the S&P 500, and the average Sharpe ratio across hedge fund groups, \n0.123, is four times that of the S&P 500. What might be the source of such performance? \n One possibility, of course, is the obvious one: These results may reflect a high degree of \nskill among hedge fund managers. Another possibility is that funds maintain some expo-\nsure to omitted risk factors that convey a positive risk premium. One likely candidate \nfor such a factor would be liquidity, and we will see shortly that liquidity and liquidity \nrisk are associated with average returns. Moreover, several other factors make hedge fund \nperformance difficult to evaluate, and these too are worth considering.  \n   Liquidity and Hedge Fund Performance \n One explanation for apparently attractive hedge fund performance is liquidity. Recall from \nChapter 9 that one of the more important extensions of the CAPM is a version that allows \nfor the possibility of a return premium for investors willing to hold less liquid assets. \nHedge funds tend to hold more illiquid assets than other institutional investors such as \nmutual funds. They can do so because of restrictions such as the lock-up provisions that \ncommit investors to keep their investment in the fund for some period of time. Therefore, \nit is important to control for liquidity when evaluating performance. If it is ignored, what \n Table 26.3 \n Index model regressions for hedge fund indexes \n  Estimation period: January 2005\u2013November 2011  \n Source: Authors\u2019 calculations using data downloaded from Hedge Fund Research Inc.,  www.hedgefundresearch.com  , March 2012.

Aragon\u2019s work suggests that the typical \u201calpha\u201d exhibited by hedge funds may be interpreted as an equilibrium liquidity premium rather than a sign of stock-picking ability, in other words a \u201cfair\u201d reward for providing liquidity to other investors.\n  \n One symptom of illiquid assets is serial correlation in returns. Positive serial correla-\ntion means that positive returns are more likely to be followed by positive than by negative returns. Such a pattern is often taken as an indicator of less liquid markets for the following reason. When prices are not available because an asset is not actively traded, the hedge fund must estimate its value to calculate net asset value and rates of return. But such proce-dures are at best imperfect and, as demonstrated by Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov, tend to result in serial correlation in prices as firms either smooth out their value estimates or only gradually mark prices to true market values.  \n7   Positive serial correlation is therefore often \ninterpreted as evidence of liquidity problems; in nearly efficient markets with frictionless trading, we would expect serial correlation or other predictable patterns in prices to be minimal. Most mutual funds show almost no evidence of such correlation in their returns, and the serial correlation of the S&P 500 in most periods is just about zero.  \n8   \n Hasanhodzic and Lo find that hedge fund returns in fact exhibit significant serial cor-\nrelation. This suggestion of smoothed prices has two important implications. First, it lends further support to the hypothesis that hedge funds are holding less liquid assets and that their apparent alphas may in fact be liquidity premiums. Second, it implies that their risk-adjusted performance measures are upward-biased, because any smoothing in the estimates of portfolio value will reduce total volatility (increasing the Sharpe ratio) as well as covari-ances and therefore betas with systematic factors (increasing risk-adjusted alphas). In fact,  Figure\u00a0 26.2  shows that both the alphas and Sharpe ratios of the hedge fund indexes in  Table\u00a026.3  increase with the serial correlation of returns. These results are consistent with the fund-specific results of Hasanhodzic and Lo and suggest that price smoothing may account for some part of the apparently superior average hedge fund performance.  \n Whereas Aragon focuses on the average  level  of liquidity, Sadka addresses the liquidity \n risk  of hedge funds.  \n9   He shows that exposure to unexpected declines in market liquidity is \nan important determinant of average hedge fund returns, and that the spread in average \nreturns across the funds with the highest and lowest liquidity exposure may be as much \n  6 George O.

This aberration arises from the period of the financial \ncrash, when the return on the S&P 500 was strongly negative in sequential months (September through November 2008, and then again in January and February of 2009). These sequences of large, consecutive negative returns resulted in positive serial correlation over the sample period, a highly unusual outcome for the index. Note, how-ever, that even in this period, the average serial correlation of the hedge fund indexes is nearly twice that of the S&P 500. \n  \n9 Ronnie Sadka, \u201cLiquidity Risk and the Cross-Section of Hedge-Fund Returns,\u201d  Journal of Financial Economics,  \n98 (October, 2010), 54\u201371. \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   937bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   937 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n9 3 8 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n\u22120.2\u22120.100.10.20.30.40.5\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\nSerial Correlation of ReturnsAlphaA\n\u22120.2\u22120.100.10.20.30.40.5\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\nSerial Correlation of ReturnsSharpe RatioB\n Figure 26.2 Hedge funds with higher serial correlation in returns, an indicator \nof illiquid portfolio holdings, exhibit higher alphas ( panel A ) and higher Sharpe \nratios ( panel B ).   \n Source: Plotted from data in  Table\u00a026.3  .\nas 6% annually.

Average return clearly rises with exposure to changes in \nmarket liquidity.   \n Returns can be even more difficult to interpret if a hedge fund takes advantage of illiquid \nmarkets to manipulate returns by purposely misvaluing illiquid assets. In this regard, it is \nworth noting that, on average, reported hedge fund returns in December are substantially \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   938bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   938 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 26 Hedge Funds 939\ngreater than average returns \nin other months.  10   The pattern \nis stronger for lower-liquidity \nfunds and funds that are near \nor beyond the threshold return \nat which performance incen-\ntive fees kick in. It appears that \nsome funds use their discre-\ntion in valuing assets to move \nreturns to December when that \nwill enhance their annual incen-\ntive fees. It also appears that \nsome hedge funds attempt to \nmanipulate their measured per-\nformance by buying additional \nshares in stocks they already \nown in an effort to push up their \nprices.  11   The buying takes place \njust before market close at the \nend of the month when hedge \nfund performance is reported. \nMoreover, the effort is concen-\ntrated in less liquid stocks where the price impact would be expected to be greater. If, as \nthese papers suggest, funds take advantage of illiquid markets to manage returns, then accu-\nrate performance measurement becomes almost impossible.    \n  Hedge Fund Performance and Survivorship Bias \n We already know that survivorship bias (when only successful funds are included in a \ndatabase) can affect the estimated performance of a sample of mutual funds. The same \nproblems, as well as related ones, apply to hedge funds.    Backfill bias    arises because hedge \nfunds report returns to database publishers only if they choose to. Funds started with seed \ncapital will open to the public and therefore enter standard databases only if their past \nperformance is deemed sufficiently successful to attract clients. Therefore, the prior per-\nformance of funds that are eventually included in the sample may not be representative of \ntypical performance.    Survivorship bias    arises when unsuccessful funds that cease opera-\ntion stop reporting returns and leave a database, leaving behind only the successful funds. \nMalkiel and Saha find that attrition rates for hedge funds are far higher than for mutual \nfunds\u2014in fact, commonly more than double the attrition rate of mutual funds\u2014making \nthis an important issue to address.  12   Estimates of survivorship bias in various studies are \ntypically substantial, in the range of 2%\u20134%.  13    \n10 Vikas Agarwal, Naveen D.

But hedge funds are designed to be \nopportunistic and have considerable flexibil-\nity to change that profile. This too can make \nperformance evaluation tricky. If risk is not \nconstant, then estimated alphas will be biased \nif we use a standard, linear index model. And \nif the risk profile changes in systematic man-\nner with the expected return on the market, \nperformance evaluation is even more difficult. \n To see why, look at  Figure\u00a026.4 , which \nillustrates the characteristic line of a per-\nfect market timer (see Chapter 24, Section \n24.4) who engages in no security selection \nbut moves funds from T-bills into the market \nportfolio only when the market will outper-\nform bills. The characteristic line is non-\nlinear, with a slope of 0 when the market\u2019s \nexcess return is negative, and a slope of 1 \nwhen it is positive. But a na\u00efve attempt to \nestimate a regression equation from this pat-\ntern would result in a fitted line with a slope \nbetween 0 and 1, and a positive alpha. Nei-\nther statistic accurately describes the fund. \n  As we noted in Chapter 24, and as is evi-\ndent from  Figure\u00a026.4 , an ability to conduct \nperfect market timing is much like obtaining \na call option on the underlying portfolio with-\nout having to pay for it. Similar nonlinearities \nwould arise if the fund actually buys or writes \noptions.  Figure\u00a0 26.5 , panel A illustrates the \ncase of a fund that holds a stock portfolio and \nwrites put options on it, and panel B illustrates \nthe case of a fund that holds a stock portfo-\nlio and writes call options. In both cases, the \ncharacteristic line is steeper when portfolio \nreturns are poor\u2014in other words, the fund \nhas greater sensitivity to the market when it is \nfalling than when it is rising. This is the oppo-\nsite profile that would arise from timing abil-\nity, which is much like acquiring rather than \nwriting options, and therefore would give the \nfund greater sensitivity to market advances.  14     \nReturn to Perfect Market Timer\nFitted Regression LinePortfolio Return\nMarket Return rf\n Figure 26.4 Characteristic line of a perfect market timer. \nThe true characteristic line is kinked, with a shape like that \nof a call option.

Many showed effectively symmetric up- and \ndown-market betas. However,  Figure\u00a026.6 , panel A shows that the asymmetry affects hedge funds taken as group. \n  16 Nassim N. Taleb,  Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets  (New York: \nTEXERE (Thomson), 2004); Nassim N. Taleb,  The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable  (New \nYork: Random House, 2007).   Figure 26.6  presents evidence on these sorts of nonlinearities. A nonlinear regression \nline is fitted to the scatter diagram of returns on hedge fund indexes plotted against returns \non the S&P 500. The fitted lines in each panel suggest that these funds have higher down-market betas (higher slopes) than up-market betas.  \n15    \n This is precisely what investors do  not  want: higher market sensitivity when the market \nis weak. This is evidence that funds may be  writing  options, either explicitly or implicitly \nthrough dynamic trading strategies (see Chapter 21, Section 21.5, for a discussion of such dynamic strategies). \n Just as hedge fund betas may be unstable, so may be other aspects of their risk profile, for \nexample, total volatility of returns. Because they have great discretion to use leverage and to trade in derivatives, these funds have tremendous capacity to alter their risk exposures. Recall from Chapter 24 that when portfolio managers can change risk within any measurement period, they can also manipulate standard measures of risk-adjusted return. Thus, one would like them to compute and report manipulation-proof performance measures such as Morning-star\u2019s risk-adjusted return.  \n  Tail Events and Hedge Fund Performance \n Imagine a hedge fund whose entire investment strategy is to hold an S&P 500 index fund and write deep out-of-the-money put options on the index. Clearly the fund manager brings no skill to his job. But if you knew only his investment results over limited periods, and not his underlying strategy, you might be fooled into thinking that he is extremely talented. For if the put options are written sufficiently out-of-the-money, they will only rarely end up imposing a loss, and such a strategy can appear over long periods\u2014even over many years\u2014to be consistently profitable. In most periods, the strategy brings in a modest premium from the written puts and therefore outperforms the S&P 500, yielding the impression of con-sistently superior performance. The huge loss that might be incurred in an extreme market decline might not be experienced even over periods as long as years. Every so often, such as in the market crash of October 1987, the strategy may lose multiples of its entire gain over the last decade. But if you are lucky enough to avoid these rare but extreme  tail events   \n(so named because they fall in the far-left tail of the probability distribution), the strategy might appear to be gilded. \n The evidence in  Figure\u00a026.6  indicating that hedge funds are at least implicitly option \nwriters should make us nervous about taking their measured performance at face value. The problem in interpreting strategies with exposure to extreme tail events (such as short options positions) is that these events by definition occur very infrequently, so  decades   \nof results may be needed to fully appreciate their true risk and reward attributes. In two influential books, Nassim Taleb, who is a hedge fund operator himself, argues that many hedge funds are analogous to our hypothetical manager, racking up fame and fortune through strategies that make money  most  of the time but expose investors to rare but \nextreme losses.  \n16   \n Taleb uses the metaphor of the black swan to discuss the importance of highly improb-\nable, but highly impactful, events. Until the discovery of Australia, Europeans believed that all swans were white: they had never encountered swans that were not white. In their experi-ence, the black swan was outside the realm of reasonable possibility, in statistical jargon, an extreme outlier relative to their sample of observations. Taleb argues that the world is filled \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   941bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   941 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n942\n942\n Figure 26.6 Monthly return on hedge fund indexes versus return on the S&P 500, 2008\u20132012.

While we can\u2019t predict which black swans to expect, we nevertheless know that some black swan may be making an appearance at any moment. The October 1987 crash, when the market fell by more than 20% in 1 day, might be viewed as a black swan\u2014an event that had never taken place before, one that most market observers would have dismissed as impossible and certainly not worth modeling, but with high impact. These sorts of events seemingly come out of the blue, and they caution us to show great humility when we use past experience to evaluate the future risk of our actions. With this in mind, consider again the example of Long Term Capital Management. \n \n In the late 1990s, Long Term Capital Management was widely viewed as the most \nsuccessful hedge fund in history. It had consistently provided double-digit returns to its investors, and it had earned hundreds of millions of dollars in incentive fees for its managers. The firm used sophisticated computer models to estimate correlations across assets and believed that its capital was almost 10 times the annual standard deviation of its portfolio returns, presumably enough to withstand any \u201cpossible\u201d shock to capital (at least, assuming normal distributions!). But in the summer of 1998, things went badly. On August 17, 1998, Russia defaulted on its sovereign debt and threw capital markets into chaos. LTCM\u2019s  1-day  loss on August 21 was $550 million (approximately nine times \nits estimated  monthly  standard deviation). Total losses in August were about $1.3 bil-\nlion, despite the fact that LTCM believed that most of its positions were market-neutral relative-value trades. Losses accrued on virtually all of its positions, flying in the face of the presumed diversification of the overall portfolio. \n How did this happen? The answer lies in the massive flight to quality and, even \nmore so, to liquidity that was set off by the Russian default. LTCM was typically a seller \nof liquidity (holding less liquid assets, selling more liquid assets with lower yields, and earning the yield spread) and suffered huge losses. This was a different type of shock from those that appeared in its historical sample/modeling period. In the liquidity crisis that engulfed asset markets, the unexpected commonality of liquidity risk across usually uncorrelated asset classes became obvious. Losses that seemed statistically impossible on past experience had in fact come to pass; LTCM fell victim to a black swan.  Example 26.3 Tail Events and Long-Term Capital Management \n However,  Figure\u00a026.6  shows that the broad hedge fund index did not exhibit notice-\nably greater tail risk than other stock investments during the financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. \nWhile equity returns were generally dismal in that period, typical hedge fund returns were actually less negative than those of the S&P 500. This, of course, is consistent with the generally low betas of these funds.    \n The typical hedge fund fee structure is a management fee of 1% to 2% of assets plus an    incentive fee    equal to 20% of investment profits beyond a stipulated benchmark perfor-\nmance, annually. Incentive fees are effectively call options on the portfolio with a strike price equal to current portfolio value times 1\u00a0 1 \u00a0benchmark return. The manager gets the \nfee if the portfolio value rises sufficiently, but loses nothing if it falls.  Figure\u00a026.7  illustrates the incentive fee for a fund with a 20% incentive fee and a hurdle rate equal to the money mar-ket rate,  r  \n f   . The current value of the portfolio is denoted  S  0  and the year-end value is  S   T  . The \nincentive fee is equivalent to .20 call options on the portfolio with exercise price  S  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f   ).      26.6 Fee Structure in Hedge Funds  \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   943bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   943 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n9 4 4 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n Suppose the standard deviation of a hedge fund\u2019s annual rate of return is 30% and the \nincentive fee is 20% of any investment return over the risk-free money market rate. If \nthe portfolio currently has a net asset value of $100 per share, and the effective annual \nrisk-free rate is 5% (or 4.88% expressed as a continuously compounded rate), then \nthe implicit exercise price on the incentive fee is $105. The Black-Scholes value of a call \noption with  S  0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0100,\u00a0 X \u00a0 5 \u00a0105,\u00a0 s \u00a0 5 \u00a0.30,\u00a0 r \u00a0 5 \u00a0.0488,\u00a0 T \u00a0 5 \u00a01 year is $11.92, just a shade \nbelow 12% of net asset value. Because the incentive fee is worth 20% of the call option, \nits value is just about 2.4% of net asset value. Together with a typical management fee \nof 2% of net asset value, the investor in the fund pays fees with a total value of 4.4%.  Example 26.4 Black-Scholes Valuation of Incentive Fees \n The major complication to this description of the typical \ncompensation structure is the    high water mark.      If a fund \nexperiences losses, it may not be able to charge an incentive \nfee unless and until it recovers to its previous higher value. \nWith large losses, this may be difficult. High water marks \ntherefore give managers an incentive to shut down funds that \nhave performed poorly, and likely are a cause of the high attri-\ntion rate for funds noted above. \n One of the fastest-growing sectors in the hedge fund uni-\nverse has been in    funds of funds,      which are hedge funds \nthat invest in one or more other hedge funds. Funds of funds \nare also called  feeder funds,   because they feed assets from \nthe original investor to the ultimate hedge fund. They are \nmarketed as providing investors the capability to diver-\nsify across funds, and also as providing the due diligence \ninvolved in screening funds for investment worthiness. In \nprinciple, this can be a valuable service because many hedge \nfunds are opaque and feeder funds may have greater insight \nthan typical outsiders. \n However, when Bernard Madoff was arrested in December 2008 after admitting to \na massive Ponzi scheme, many large feeder funds were found to be among his biggest \nclients, and their \u201cdue diligence\u201d may have been, to put it mildly, lacking. At the head \nof the list was Fairfield Greenwich Advisors, with exposure reported at $7.5 billion, but \nseveral other feeder funds and asset management firms around the world were also on \nthe hook for amounts greater than $1 billion. In the end, it appears that some funds had \nin effect become little more than marketing agents for Madoff. The nearby box presents \nfurther discussion of the Madoff affair.  \n The option-like nature of compensation can have a big impact on expected fees in funds \nof funds. This is because the fund of funds pays an incentive fee to each underlying fund \nthat outperforms its benchmark, even if the aggregate performance of the fund of funds is \npoor. In this case, diversification can hurt you!  17     \nS0(1 + rf) STIncentive Fee\nSlope = .20\n Figure 26.7 Incentive fees as a call option. \nThe current value of the portfolio is \ndenoted  S  0  and its year-end value is  S   T  . \nThe incentive fee is equivalent to .20 call \noptions on the portfolio with exercise price \n S  0 (1\u00a0 1 \u00a0 r   f   ).  \n  17 S.

For simplicity, we will ignore the asset-value-based portion of fees (the manage-ment fee) and focus only on the incentive fee. Suppose that the hurdle rate for the incentive fee is a zero return, so each fund charges an incentive fee of 20% of total return. The following table shows the performance of each underlying fund over a year, the gross rate of return, and the return realized by the fund of funds net of the incentive fee. Funds 1 and 2 have positive returns, and therefore earn an incentive fee, but Fund 3 has terrible performance, so its incentive fee is zero.  Example 26.5 Incentive Fees in Funds of Funds  The Bernard Madoff Scandal \n Bernard Madoff seemed like one of the great success \nstories in the annals of finance. His asset management firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, reported to its clients that their investments of around $20 billion were worth about $65 billion in 2008. But that Decem-ber, Madoff reportedly confessed to his two sons that he had for years been operating a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud in which a manager col-lects funds from clients, claims to invest those funds on the clients\u2019 behalf, reports extremely favorable investment returns, but in fact uses the funds for his own purposes. (The schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, whose suc-cess with this scheme in the early 1900s made him notori-ous throughout the United States.) Early investors who ask to redeem their investments are paid back with the funds coming in from new investors rather than with true earn-ings. The scheme can continue as long as new investors provide enough funds to cover the redemption requests of the earlier ones\u2014and these inflows are attracted by the superior returns \u201cearned\u201d by early investors and their apparent ability to redeem funds as requested. \n As a highly respected member of the Wall Street estab-\nlishment, Madoff was in a perfect position to perpetrate \nsuch a fraud. He was a pioneer in electronic trading and had served as chairman of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Aside from its trading operations, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC also acted as a money manager, and it claimed to achieve highly consistent annual returns, between 10% and 12% in good markets as well as bad. Its strategy was supposedly based on option hedging strate-gies, but Madoff was never precise about his approach. Still, his stature on Wall Street and the prestige of his cli-ent list seemed to testify to his legitimacy. Moreover, he played hard to get, and the appearance that one needed connections to join the fund only increased its appeal. The scheme seems to have operated for decades, but in the 2008 stock market downturn, several large clients requested redemptions totaling around $7 billion. With less than $1 billion of assets left in the firm, the scheme collapsed. \n Not everyone was fooled, and in retrospect, several red \nflags should have aroused suspicion. For example, some \ninstitutional investors shied away from the fund, objecting to its unusual opacity. Given the magnitude of the assets supposedly under management, the option hedging trades purportedly at the heart of Madoff\u2019s investment strategy should have dominated options market trading volume, yet there was no evidence of their execution. Moreover, Madoff\u2019s auditor, a small firm with only three employees (including only one active accountant!), seemed grossly inadequate to audit such a large and complex operation. In addition, Madoff\u2019s fee structure was highly unusual. Rather than acting as a hedge fund that would charge a per-centage of assets plus incentive fees, he claimed to profit instead through trading commissions on the account\u2014if true, this would have been a colossal price break to clients. Finally, rather than placing assets under management with a custodial bank as most funds do, Madoff claimed to keep the funds in house, which meant that no one could inde-pendently verify their existence. In 2000, the SEC received a letter from an industry professional named Harry Mar-kopolos concluding that \u201cMadoff Securities is the world\u2019s largest Ponzi scheme,\u201d but Madoff continued to operate unimpeded. \n Even today, several questions remain unanswered. How \nmuch help did Madoff receive from others? Exactly how \nmuch money was lost? Most of the \u201clost\u201d funds represented fictitious profits that had never actually been earned, but some money was returned to early investors. How much was skimmed off to support Madoff\u2019s lifestyle? And most important, why didn\u2019t the red flags and early warnings prompt a more aggressive response from regulators?  WORDS FROM THE STREET \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   945bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   945 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkmVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkmVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm946 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n The idea behind funds of funds is to spread risk across several different funds. However, \ninvestors need to be aware that these funds of funds operate with considerable leverage, \non top of the leverage of the primary funds in which they invest, which can make returns highly volatile. Moreover, if the various hedge funds in which these funds of funds invest have similar investment styles, the diversification benefits of spreading investments across several funds may be illusory\u2014but the extra layer of steep management fees paid to the manager of the fund of funds certainly is not.  \n18       Fund 1 Fund 2 Fund 3 Fund of Funds\nStart of year (millions) $1.00 $1.00 $1.00 $3.00\nEnd of year (millions) $1.20 $1.40 $0.25 $2.85\nGross rate of return 20% 40% 275% 25%\nIncentive fee (millions) $0.04 $0.08 $0.00 $0.12\nEnd of year, net of fee $1.16 $1.32 $0.25 $2.73\nNet rate of return 16% 32% 275% 29%\n Even though the return on the aggregate portfolio of the fund of funds is  negative  \n5%, it still pays incentive fees of $.12 for every $3 invested because incentive fees are \npaid on the first two well-performing funds. The incentive fees amount to 4% of net asset value. As demonstrated in the last column, this reduces the rate of return earned by the fund of funds from  2 5% to  2 9%. \n  18 One small silver lining: while funds of funds pay incentive fees to each of the underlying funds, the incentive \nfees they charge their own investors tend to be lower, typically around 10% rather than 20%. \n    1 .  Like mutual funds, hedge funds pool the assets of several clients and manage the pooled assets on their behalf. However, hedge funds differ from mutual funds with respect to disclosure, investor base, flexibility and predictability of investment orientation, regulation, and fee structure.  \n   2 .  Directional funds take a stance on the performance of broad market sectors. Nondirectional funds establish market-neutral positions on relative mispricing. However, even these hedged positions still present idiosyncratic risk.  \n   3 .  Statistical arbitrage is the use of quantitative systems to uncover many perceived misalignments in relative pricing and ensure profits by averaging over all of these small bets. It often uses data-mining methods to uncover past patterns that form the basis for the established investment positions.  \n   4 .  Portable alpha is a strategy in which one invests in positive-alpha positions, then hedges the sys-tematic risk of that investment, and, finally, establishes market exposure where desired by using passive indexes or futures contracts.  \n   5 .  Performance evaluation of hedge funds is complicated by survivorship bias, by the potential instability of risk attributes, by the existence of liquidity premiums, and by unreliable market valuations of infrequently traded assets. Performance evaluation is particularly difficult when the fund engages in option positions. Tail events make it hard to assess the true performance of posi-tions involving options without extremely long histories of returns.

Hedge funds typically charge investors both a management fee and an incentive fee equal to a \npercentage of profits beyond some threshold value.

Reconsider the hedge fund in the previous problem. Suppose it is January 1, the standard devia-\ntion of the fund\u2019s annual returns is 50%, and the risk-free rate is 4%.

Each month it holds $100 million of an \nS&P 500 index fund and writes out-of-the-money put options on $100 million of the index with exercise price 5% lower than the current value of the index. Suppose the premium it receives for writing each put is $.25 million, roughly in line with the actual value of the puts.\n    a. Calculate the Sharpe ratio the fund would have realized in the period October 1982\u2013September \n1987. Compare its Sharpe ratio to that of the S&P 500. Use the data from the previous prob-\nlem, available at the Online Learning Center, and assume the monthly risk-free interest rate over this period was .7%.  \n   b. Now calculate the Sharpe ratio the fund would have realized if we extend the sample period \nby 1 month to include October 1987.

Suppose initially that a fund of funds (FF) manager buys equal amounts of each of these funds, and also charges its investors a 20% incentive fee. For simplicity, assume also that management fees other than incentive fees are zero for all funds.  \nHedge \nFund 1Hedge \nFund 2Hedge \nFund 3\nStart of year value (millions) $100 $100 $100\nGross portfolio rate of return 20% 10% 30%\n    a. Compute the rate of return after incentive fees to an investor in the fund of funds.  \n   b. Suppose that instead of buying shares in each of the three hedge funds, a stand-alone (SA) \nhedge fund purchases the same  portfolio  as the three underlying funds. The total value and \ncomposition of the SA fund is therefore identical to the one that would result from aggregat-ing the three hedge funds. Consider an investor in the SA fund. After paying 20% incentive fees, what would be the value of the investor\u2019s portfolio at the end of the year?  \n   c. Confirm that the investor\u2019s rate of return in SA is higher than in FF by an amount equal to \nthe extra layer of fees charged by the fund of funds.  \n   d. Now suppose that the return on the portfolio held by hedge fund 3 were  2 30% rather than \n 1 30%. Recalculate your answers to parts ( a ) and ( b ). Will either FF or SA charge an incentive \nfee in this scenario? Why then does the investor in FF still do worse than the investor in SA?        \n \n E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES \n Log on to  www.hedgeindex.com , a site run by Credit Suisse/Tremont, which maintains \nthe TASS Hedge Funds Data Base of the performance of more than 2,000 hedge funds, \nand produces indexes of investment performance for several hedge fund classes. Click the Downloads tab (free registration is required for access to this part of the Web site). From the Downloads page, you can access historical rates of return on each of the hedge fund subclasses (e.g., market neutral, event-driven, dedicated short bias, and so on). Download 5 years of monthly returns for each subclass and download returns on the S&P 500 for the same period from  finance.yahoo.com . Calculate the beta of the equity-market-neutral \nand dedicated short bias funds. Do the results seem reasonable in terms of the orienta-tion of these funds? Next, look at the year-by-year performance of each hedge fund class. How does the variability of performance results in different years compare to that of the S&P 500? \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   949bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   949 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkmVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm950 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS \n   1 .      a.   Nondirectional. The shares in the fund and the short position in the index swap constitute a \nhedged position. The hedge fund is betting that the discount on the closed-end fund will shrink \nand that it will profit regardless of the general movements in the Indian market.  \n  b . Nondirectional. The value of both positions is driven by the value of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. The hedge \nfund is betting that the market is undervaluing Petri relative to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and that as the  relative  values of the two positions come back into alignment, it will profit regardless of \nthe movements in the underlying shares.  \n  c . Directional. This is an outright bet on the price that Generic Pharmaceuticals will eventually \ncommand at the conclusion of the predicted takeover attempt.     \n   2. The expected rate of return on the position (in the absence of any knowledge about idiosyncratic risk \nreflected in the residual) is 3%. If the residual turns out to be  2 4%, then the position will lose 1% \nof its value over the month and fall to $1.188 million. The excess return on the market in this month over T-bills would be 5%\u00a0  2 \u00a0 1%\u00a0  5  \u00a0 4%, while the excess return on the hedged strategy would be \n 2 1%\u00a0 2  \u00a01%\u00a0 5  \u00a0 2 2%, so the strategy would plot in panel A as the point (4%,\u00a0 2 2%). In panel B, which \nplots  total  returns on the market and the hedge position, the strategy would plot as the point (5%,\u00a0 2 1%).  \n   3. Fixed-income arbitrage portfolios show positive exposure to the long bond and to the credit \nspread. This pattern suggests that these are  not  hedged arbitrage portfolios, but in fact are \ndirectional portfolios.                \nbod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   950bod61671_ch26_926-950.indd   950 7/25/13   2:04 AM7/25/13   2:04 AMFinal PDF to printer\n     2 77\n  THIS CHAPTER CONSIDERS\u00a0 practical com-\nplexities in the process of constructing opti-\nmal portfolios. It might seem that the word \u201ctheory\u201d in the chapter title is inconsistent with this practical goal, and that the forego-ing chapters must already have exhausted the insight that theory can impart to portfo-lio management in the field\u2014the rest surely must rely on learning by doing. \n We will see, however, that theory has a \nsignificant contribution to offer even when \nit comes to the daily grind of putting it all together. We begin with the Treynor-Black model that we first encountered in Chapter\u00a08, now showing how to handle limited  precision in the forecasts of alpha values and the extreme portfolio positions often prescribed by the model. Armed with these insights, we present a prototype organizational chart and discuss the efficacy of fitting the organization to the theoretical underpinning of portfolio management. \n In the next section, we present the Black-\nLitterman model that allows flexible views \nabout the expected returns of asset classes to improve asset allocation. Finally, we look into the potential profitability of security analysis and end with concluding remarks. An appen-dix to the chapter presents the mathematics underlying the Black-Litterman model.   PART VII  The Theory of Active \nPortfolio Management  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN \n    27.1 Optimal Portfolios and Alpha Values \n  In Chapter 8 we showed how to form an optimal risky portfolio with a single-index model. \n Table\u00a027.1  summarizes the steps in this optimization, commonly known as the Treynor-Black model.  \n1   The outlined procedure uses the index model that ignores nonzero cova-\nriance values across residuals. This is sometimes called the  diagonal model,  because it \nassumes that the covariance matrix of residuals has nonzero entries only on the diagonals. Moreover, we saw that despite significant correlation between some pairs of residuals in the portfolio construction example we used in Chapter 8, for example, between Shell and BP, the efficient frontiers formed from the index model and the Markowitz model were barely distinguishable (see Figure 8.5 of Chapter 8).   \n1 We know from Chapter 10 that a multiple-index model such as that of Fama and French may better describe \nsecurity returns. In that case, the passive market-index portfolio will be augmented with positions in the addi-\ntional factor portfolios (for example, the size and value portfolios in the FF model). However, the rest of the Treynor-Black procedure will remain unchanged. \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   951bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   951 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n9 5 2 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n For illustration, in this chapter we continue with the example employed in Chapter\u00a08. \n Spreadsheet\u00a027.1  recaps the data and results of this exercise. Table D in the spreadsheet \nshows the improvement in the Sharpe ratio over the    passive market-index portfolio  \noffered by adding the    active portfolio    to the mix. To better appreciate this improvement \nwe have included the  M -square measure of performance.  M -square is the incremental \nexpected return of the optimized portfolio compared to the passive alternative once the \nactive portfolio is mixed with bills to provide the same total volatility as the index portfolio \n(for a review, see Chapter 24).  \n   Forecasts of Alpha Values and Extreme Portfolio Weights \n The overriding impression from  Spreadsheet\u00a027.1  is the apparently meager performance \nimprovement: Table D of the spreadsheet shows that  M -square increases by only 19 basis \npoints (equivalent to an improvement of .0136 in the Sharpe ratio). Notice that the Sharpe \nratio of the active portfolio is inferior to that of the passive portfolio (due to its large \nstandard deviation) and hence its  M -square is actually negative. But the active portfolio \nis mixed with the passive portfolio, so total volatility is not its appropriate measure of \nrisk. When combined with the passive portfolio, it does offer some improvement in per-\nformance, albeit quite modest. This is the best that can be had given the    alpha values  \n Table 27.1 \n Construction and \nproperties of the \noptimal risky \nportfolio   1.

Notice that the position in the active port-\nfolio amounts to 17%, financed in part by a combined short position in Dell and Walmart \nof about 10%. Because the figures in  Spreadsheet\u00a027.1  are annualized, this performance is \nequivalent to a 1-year holding-period return (HPR).  \n The alpha values we used in  Spreadsheet\u00a027.1  are actually small by the standard of \ntypical analysts\u2019 forecasts. On June 1, we downloaded the current prices of the six stocks \nin the example, as well as analysts\u2019 1-year target prices for each firm. These data and the \nimplied annual alpha values are shown in  Table\u00a027.2 . Notice that all alphas are positive, \nindicating an optimistic view for this group of stocks.  Figure\u00a027.1  shows the graphs of the \nstock prices, as well as the S&P 500 index (ticker\u00a0 5 \u00a0GSPC), for the previous year. The \ngraph shows that the optimistic views in  Table\u00a027.2  are not a result of extrapolating rates \nfrom the past.   \n Spreadsheet 27.1\nActive portfolio management with a universe of six stocks          \u03c32(e)\n\u03b1/\u03c32(e)\nw0(i)\n[w0(i)]2\n\u03b1A\n\u03c32(eA)\nw0\nw*1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49AC D E F G H I J\nTable A: Risk Parameters of the Investable Universe (annualized)\nSD of \nExcess \nReturn BetaSD of \nSystematic \nComponent SD of \nResidualCorrelation \nwith the S&P\n500\nS&P 500 0.1358 1.00 0.1358 0 1\nHP 0.3817 2.03 0.2762 0.2656 0.72\nDELL 0.2901 1.23 0.1672 0.2392 0.58\nWMT 0.1935 0.62 0.0841 0.1757 0.43\nTARGET 0.2611 1.27 0.1720 0.1981 0.66\nBP 0.1822 0.47 0.0634 0.1722 0.35\nSHELL 0.1988 0.67 0.0914 0.1780 0.46\nTable B: The Index Model Covariance Matrix\nSP 500 HP DELL WMT TARGET BP SHELL\nBeta 1.00 2.03 1.23 0.62 1.27 0.47 0.67\nS&P 500 1.00 0.0184 0.0375 0.0227 0.0114 0.0234 0.0086 0.0124\nHP 2.03 0.0375 0.1457 0.0462 0.0232 0.0475 0.0175 0.0253\nDELL 1.23 0.0227 0.0462 0.0842 0.0141 0.0288 0.0106 0.0153\nWMT 0.62 0.0114 0.0232 0.0141 0.0374 0.0145 0.0053 0.0077\nTARGET 1.27 0.0234 0.0475 0.0288 0.0145 0.0682 0.0109 0.0157\nBP 0.47 0.0086 0.0175 0.0106 0.0053 0.0109 0.0332 0.0058\nSHELL 0.67 0.0124 0.0253 0.0153 0.0077 0.0157 0.0058 0.0395\nTable C: Macro Forecast (S&P 500) and Forecasts of Alpha Values\nSP 500 HP DELL WMT TARGET BP SHELL\nAlpha 0 0.0150 \u22120.0100 \u22120.0050 0.0075 0.012 0.0025\nRisk premium 0.0600 0.1371 0.0639 0.0322 0.0835 0.0400 0.0429\nTable D: Computation of the Optimal Risky Portfolio\nS&P 500 Active Pf A HP DELL WMT TARGET BP SHELL\n0.0705 0.0572 0.0309 0.0392 0.0297 0.0317\n0.5505 0.2126 \u22120.1748 \u22120.1619 0.1911 0.4045 0.0789\n1.0000 0.3863 \u22120.3176 \u22120.2941 0.3472 0.7349 0.1433\n0.1492 0.1009 0.0865 0.1205 0.5400 0.0205\n0.0222\n0.0404\n0.1691 Overall\n0.8282 0.1718 Portfolio 0.0663 \u22120.0546 \u22120.0505 0.0596 0.1262 0.0246\nBeta 1 1.0922 1.0158 0.0663 \u22120.0546 \u22120.0505 0.0596 0.1262 0.0246\nRisk premium 0.06 0.0878 0.0648 0.0750 0.1121 0.0689 0.0447 0.0880 0.0305\nSD 0.1358 0.2497 0.1422 0.3817 0.2901 0.1935 0.2611 0.1822 0.1988\nSharpe ratio 0.44 0.35 0.4556\nM-square 0 \u22120.0123 0.0019\nBenchmark risk 0.0346B\neXcel\nPlease visit us at \nwww.mhhe.com/bkm\nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   953bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   953 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n9 5 4 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  Table\u00a0 27.3  shows the optimal portfolio using the analysts\u2019 forecasts rather than the \n original alpha values in Table D in  Spreadsheet\u00a027.1 . The difference in performance is \nstriking. The Sharpe ratio of the new optimal portfolio has increased from the bench-\nmark\u2019s .44 to 2.32, amounting to a huge risk-adjusted return advantage. This shows up \nin an  M -square of 25.53%! However, these results also expose a potential major problem \nwith the Treynor-Black model. The optimal portfolio calls for extreme long/short positions \nthat may be infeasible for a real-world portfolio manager. For example, the model calls for \na position of 5.79 (579%) in the active portfolio, largely financed by a short position of \n2 4.79 in the S&P 500 index. Moreover, the standard deviation of this optimal portfolio \nis 52.24%, a level of risk that only extremely aggressive hedge funds would be willing to \nbear. It is important to notice that this risk is largely nonsystematic because the beta of the \nactive portfolio, at .95, is less than 1.0, and the beta of the overall risky portfolio is even \nlower, only .73, because of the short position in the passive portfolio. Only hedge funds \nmay still be interested in this portfolio.  \n One approach to this problem is to restrict extreme portfolio positions, beginning with \nshort sales. When the short position in the S&P 500 index is eliminated, forcing us to con-\nstrain the position in the active portfolio to be no more than 1.0, the position in the passive \nportfolio (the S&P 500) is zero, and the active portfolio comprises the entire risky posi-\ntion.  Table\u00a027.4  shows that the optimal portfolio now has a standard deviation of 15.68%, \nnot overwhelmingly greater than the SD of the passive portfolio (13.58%). The beta of \nthe overall risky portfolio is now that of the active portfolio (.95), still a slightly defensive \nportfolio in terms of systematic risk. Despite this severe restriction, the optimization pro-\ncedure is still powerful, and the  M -square of the optimal risky portfolio (now the active \nportfolio) is a very large 16.42%.  \n  Stock    HP    Dell    WMT    Target    BP    Shell  \n Current price  32.15  25.39  48.14  49.01  70.8  68.7 \n Target price  36.88  29.84  57.44  62.8  83.52  71.15 \n Implied alpha   0.1471   0.1753   0.1932   0.2814   0.1797   0.0357  Table 27.2 \n Stock prices and analysts\u2019 \ntarget prices \n Figure 27.1 Rates of return on the S&P 500 (GSPC) and the six stocks  \n+60\nHP\nBP\nRDS-B\nGSPC\nWMT\nTGT\nDELL+40\n+20\n\u221220\n\u221240\n\u221260\nJuly SeptemberRate of Return (%)\nNovember January March May0\nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   954bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   954 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 27 The Theory of Active Portfolio Management 955\n    S&P 500    Active Pf A       HP    Dell    WMT    Target    BP    Shell  \n        s  2 ( e )  0.0705  0.0572  0.0309  0.0392  0.0297  0.0317 \n     25.7562   a / s  2 ( e )  2.0855  3.0641  6.2544  7.1701  6.0566  1.1255 \n      1.0000   w  0 ( i )  0.0810  0.1190  0.2428  0.2784  0.2352  0.0437 \n       [ w  0 ( i )] 2   0.0066  0.0142  0.0590  0.0775  0.0553  0.0019 \n  a   A       0.2018               \n  s  2 ( e   A  )     0.0078               \n  w  0      7.9116               \n  w  *   0.0000   1.0000    0.0810  0.1190  0.2428  0.2784  0.2352  0.0437 \n        Overall \nPortfolio              \n Beta  1   0.9538  0.9538  0.0810  0.1190  0.2428  0.2784  0.2352  0.0437 \n Risk premium  0.06   0.2590  0.2590  0.2692  0.2492  0.2304  0.3574  0.2077  0.0761 \n SD  0.1358   0.1568  0.1568  0.3817  0.2901  0.1935  0.2611  0.1822  0.1988 \n Sharpe ratio  0.44   1.65  1.6515             \n  M -square  0   0.1642  0.1642             \n Benchmark risk      0.0887             \n Table 27.4 \n The optimal risky portfolio with constraint on the active portfolio ( w   A  \u00a0#\u00a01) \n Table 27.3 \n The optimal risky portfolio with the analysts\u2019 new forecasts   \n  S&P 500    Active \nPf A      HP    Dell    WMT    Target    BP    Shell  \n        s  2 ( e )    0.0705    0.0572    0.0309    0.0392    0.0297    0.0317 \n     25.7562   a / s  2 ( e )    2.0855    3.0641    6.2544    7.1701    6.0566    1.1255 \n      1.0000   w  0 ( i )    0.0810    0.1190    0.2428    0.2784    0.2352    0.0437 \n       [ w  0 ( i )] 2     0.0066    0.0142    0.0590    0.0775    0.0553    0.0019 \n  a   A       0.2018               \n  s  2 ( e   A  )     0.0078               \n  w  0      7.9116               \n  w  *    2 4.7937   5.7937    0.4691163  0.6892459  1.4069035  1.6128803  1.3624061  0.2531855 \n        Overall \nPortfolio              \n Beta   1   0.9538   0.7323    0.4691    0.6892    1.4069    1.6129    1.3624    0.2532 \n Risk premium   0.06   0.2590   1.2132    0.2692    0.2492    0.2304    0.3574    0.2077    0.0761 \n SD   0.1358   0.1568   0.5224    0.3817    0.2901    0.1935    0.2611    0.1822    0.1988 \n Sharpe ratio   0.44   1.65   2.3223             \n  M -square   0   0.1642   0.2553             \n Benchmark risk       0.5146             \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   955bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   955 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n956 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n Is this a satisfactory solution? This would depend on the organization. For hedge funds, \nthis may be a dream portfolio. For most mutual funds, however, the lack of diversifica-\ntion would rule it out. Notice the positions in the six stocks: Walmart, Target, and British Petroleum alone account for 76% of the portfolio. \n Here we have to acknowledge the limitations of our example. Surely, when the invest-\nment company covers more securities, the problem of lack of diversification would largely vanish. But it turns out that the problem with extreme long/short positions typically per-sists even when we consider a larger number of firms, and this can gut the practical value of the optimization model. Consider this conclusion from an important article by Black and Litterman  \n2   (whose model we will present in Section 27.3):  \n  the mean-variance optimization used in standard asset allocation models is extremely \nsensitive to expected return assumptions the investor must provide .\u00a0.\u00a0. The optimal port-folio, given its sensitivity to the expected returns, often appears to bear little or no rela-tion to the views the investor wishes to express. In practice, therefore, despite obvious conceptual attractions of a quantitative approach, few global investment managers regu-larly allow quantitative models to play a major role in their asset allocation decisions.  \n This statement is more complex than it reads at first blush, and we will analyze it in \ndepth in Section 27.3. We bring it up in this section, however, to point out the general con-\nclusion that \u201cfew global investment managers regularly allow quantitative models to play a major role in their asset allocation decisions.\u201d In fact, this statement also applies to many portfolio managers who avoid the mean-variance optimization process altogether for other reasons. We return to this issue in Section 27.4.  \n  Restriction of Benchmark Risk \n Black and Litterman point out a related important practical issue. Many investment man-agers are judged against the performance of a    benchmark,    and a benchmark index is pro-\nvided in the mutual fund prospectus. Implied in our analysis so far is that the passive portfolio, the S&P 500, is that benchmark. Such commitment raises the importance of    tracking error.    Tracking error is estimated from the time series of differences between \nthe returns on the overall risky portfolio and the benchmark return, that is,  T  \n E  \u00a0 5 \u00a0 R   P  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 R   M  . \nThe portfolio manager must be mindful of benchmark risk, that is, the standard deviation \nof the tracking error. \n The tracking error of the optimized risky portfolio can be expressed in terms of the beta \nof the portfolio and thus reveals the benchmark risk:\n   T r a c k i n g error5TE5RP2RM\nRP5w*AaA1312w*A(12bA)4RM1w*AeA\nTE5w*AaA2w*A(12bA)RM1w*AeA\nVar (TE)53w*A(12bA)42 Var (RM)1Var (w*AeA)53w*A(12bA)42sM213w*As(eA)42\nBenchmark risk 5s(TE)5w*A\"(12bA)2sM213s(eA)42  (27.1)\n   \n Equation 27.1 shows us how to calculate the volatility of tracking error and how to set the \nposition in the active portfolio,    w*A,  to restrict tracking risk to any desired level.

We must shift weight \nfrom the active to the passive portfolio.  Figure\u00a027.2  illustrates the cost. The portfolio opti-\nmization would lead us to portfolio  T,  the tangency of the capital allocation line (CAL), \nwhich is the ray from the risk-free rate to the efficient frontier formed from  A  and  M.\nReducing risk by shifting weight from  T  to  M  takes us down the efficient frontier, instead \nof along the CAL, to a lower risk position, reducing the Sharpe ratio and  M -square of the \nconstrained portfolio.  \n Notice that the standard deviation of tracking error using the \u201cmeager\u201d alpha fore-\ncasts in  Spreadsheet\u00a027.1  is only 3.46% because the weight in the active portfolio is only \n17%. Using the larger alphas based on analysts\u2019 forecasts with no restriction on portfolio \nweights, the standard deviation of tracking error is 51.46% (see  Table\u00a027.3 ), more than \nany real-life manager who is evaluated against a benchmark would be willing to bear. \nHowever, with weight of 1.0 on the active portfolio, the benchmark risk falls to 8.87% \n( Table\u00a027.4 ). \n Finally, suppose a manager wishes to restrict benchmark risk to the same level as it was \nusing the original forecasts, that is, to 3.46%. Equations 27.2 and 27.3 instruct us to invest \nWA5 \u00a0.43 in the active portfolio. We obtain the results in  Table\u00a027.5 . This portfolio is mod-\nerate, yet superior in performance: (1) its standard deviation is only slightly higher than \nthat of the passive portfolio, 13.85%; (2) its beta is .98; (3) the standard deviation of track-\ning error that we specified is extremely low, 3.85%; (4) given that we have only six securi-\nties, the largest position of 12% (in Target) is quite low and would be lower still if more \nsecurities were covered; yet (5) the Sharpe ratio is a whopping 1.06, and the  M -square is \nan impressive 8.35%. Thus, by controlling benchmark risk we can avoid the flaws of the \nunconstrained portfolio and still maintain superior performance.     \n Figure 27.2 Reduced efficiency when benchmark risk is lowered  \nMCAL\nTA\n5678910111213\n12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26\nPf Standard DeviationPortfolio Mean\nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   957bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   957 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n9 5 8 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n   27.2 The Treynor-Black Model and Forecast Precision \n  Suppose the risky portfolio of your 401(k) retirement fund is currently in an S&P 500 index \nfund, and you are pondering whether you should take some extra risk and allocate some \nfunds to Target\u2019s stock, the high-performing discounter. You know that, absent research \nanalysis, you should assume the alpha of any stock is zero. Hence, the mean of your    prior \ndistribution    of Target\u2019s alpha is zero. Downloading return data for Target and the S&P 500 \nreveals a residual standard deviation of 19.8%. Given this volatility, the prior mean of zero, \nand an assumption of normality, you now have the entire prior distribution of Target\u2019s alpha. \n One can make a decision using a prior distribution, or refine that distribution by expend-\ning effort to obtain additional data. In jargon, this effort is called  the experiment.   The \nexperiment as a stand-alone venture would yield a probability distribution of possible out-\ncomes. The optimal statistical procedure is to combine one\u2019s prior distribution for alpha \nwith the information derived from the experiment to form a    posterior distribution    that \nreflects both. This posterior distribution is then used for decision making. \n A \u201ctight\u201d prior, that is, a distribution with a small standard deviation, implies a high \ndegree of confidence in the likely range of possible alpha values even before looking at \nthe data. In this case, the experiment may not be sufficiently convincing to affect your \nbeliefs, meaning that the posterior will be little changed from the prior.  3   In the context of \nthe present discussion, an active forecast of alpha and its precision provides the experiment \nthat may induce you to update your prior beliefs about its value. The role of the portfolio \nmanager is to form a posterior distribution of alpha that serves portfolio construction.   \n    S&P 500    Active Pf A       HP    Dell    WMT    Target    BP    Shell  \n  s  2 ( e )  0.0705  0.0572  0.0309  0.0392  0.0297  0.0317 \n     25.7562   a / s  2 ( e )  2.0855  3.0641  6.2544  7.1701  6.0566  1.1255 \n      1.0000   w  0 ( i )  0.0810  0.1190  0.2428  0.2784  0.2352  0.0437 \n       [ w  0 ( i )] 2   0.0066  0.0142  0.0590  0.0775  0.0553  0.0019 \n  a   A       0.2018               \n  s  2 ( e   A  )     0.0078               \n  w  0      7.9116               \n  w  *   0.5661   0.4339    0.0351  0.0516  0.1054  0.1208  0.1020  0.0190 \n      Overall \nPortfolio              \n Beta  1   0.9538  0.9800  0.0351  0.0516  0.1054  0.1208  0.1020  0.0190 \n Risk premium  0.06   0.2590  0.1464  0.0750  0.1121  0.0689  0.0447  0.0880  0.0305 \n Standard \ndeviation  0.1358   0.1568  0.1385  0.3817  0.2901  0.1935  0.2611  0.1822  0.1988 \n Sharpe ratio  0.44   1.65  1.0569             \n  M -square  0   0.1642  0.0835             \n Benchmark risk      0.0385             \n Table 27.5 \n The optimal risky portfolio with the analysts\u2019 new forecasts (benchmark risk constrained to 3.85%) \n3 In application to debates about social issues, you might define a fanatic as one who enters the debate with a prior \nthat is so tight that no argument will influence his posterior, making the debate altogether a waste of time. \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   958bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   958 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 27 The Theory of Active Portfolio Management 959\n   Adjusting Forecasts for the Precision of Alpha \n Imagine that you have just downloaded from Yahoo! Finance the analysts\u2019 forecasts we \nused in the previous section, implying that Target\u2019s alpha is 28.1%. Should you conclude that the optimal position in Target, before adjusting for beta, is  a / s  \n2 ( e )\u00a0 5 \u00a0.281/.198 2 \u00a0 5 \u00a0\n7.17\u00a0(717%)? Naturally, before committing to such an extreme position, any reasonable manager would first ask: \u201cHow accurate is this forecast?\u201d and \u201cHow should I adjust my position to take account of forecast imprecision?\u201d \n Treynor and Black  \n4   asked this question and supplied an answer. The logic of the answer \nis quite straightforward; you must quantify the uncertainty about this forecast, just as you would the risk of the underlying asset or portfolio. A Web surfer may not have a way to assess the precision of a downloaded forecast, but the employer of the analyst who issued the forecast does. How? By examining the    forecasting record    of previous forecasts issued \nby the same forecaster.  \n Suppose that a security analyst provides the portfolio manager with forecasts of \nalpha at regular intervals, say, the beginning of each month. The investor portfolio is updated using the forecast and held until the update of next month\u2019s forecast. At the end of each month,  T,  the realized abnormal return of Target\u2019s stock is the sum of alpha plus \na residual:\n    u(T)5R\nTGT(T)2bTGTRM(T)5a(T)1e(T)  (27.4)   \n where beta is estimated from Target\u2019s security characteristic line (SCL) using data for peri-\nods prior to  T, \n    SCL:       \u00a0RTGT(t)5a1bTGTRM(t)1e(t),\u00a0\u00a0      t,T  (27.5)   \n The 1-month, forward-looking forecast  a   f  ( T ) issued by the analyst at the beginning of \nmonth  T  is aimed at the abnormal return,  u ( T ), in Equation 27.4. In order to decide how to \nuse the forecast for month  T,  the portfolio manager uses the analyst\u2019s forecasting record. \nThe analyst\u2019s record is the paired time series of all past forecasts,  a   f  ( t ), and realizations, \n u ( t ). To assess forecast accuracy, that is, the relationship between forecast and realized \nalphas, the manager uses this record to estimate the regression:\n    u(t)5a01a1af(t)1e(t)  (27.6)   \n Our goal is to adjust alpha forecasts to properly account for their imprecision. We will \nform an    adjusted alpha    forecast  a ( T  ) for the coming month by using the original fore-\ncasts  a   f  ( T ) and applying the estimates from the regression Equation 27.6, that is,\n    a(T)5a01a1af(T)  (27.7)   \n The properties of the regression estimates assure us that the adjusted forecast is the \n\u201cbest linear unbiased estimator\u201d of the abnormal return on Target in the coming month,  T.  \n \u201cBest\u201d in this context means it has the lowest possible variance among unbiased fore-\ncasts that are linear functions of the original forecast. We show in Appendix A that the value we should use for  a  \n1  in Equation 27.7 is the  R -square of the regression Equation \n27.6. Because  R -square is less than 1, this implies that we \u201cshrink\u201d the forecast toward \nzero. The lower the precision of the original forecast (the lower its  R -square), the more \nwe shrink the adjusted alpha back toward zero. The coefficient  a  0  adjusts the forecast \nupward if the forecaster has been consistently pessimistic, and downward for consistent optimism.  \n  4 Jack Treynor and Fischer Black, \u201cHow to Use Security Analysis to Improve Portfolio Selection,\u201d  Journal of \nBusiness,  January 1973. \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   959bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   959 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n9 6 0 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  Distribution of Alpha Values \n Equation 27.7 implies that the quality \nof security analysts\u2019 forecasts, as mea-\nsured by the  R -square in regressions of \nrealized abnormal returns on their fore-\ncasts, is a critical issue for construction \nof optimal portfolios and resultant per-\nformance. Unfortunately, these num-\nbers are usually impossible to come by. \n Kane, Kim, and White  5   obtained a \nunique database of analysts\u2019 forecasts \nfrom an investment company specializ-\ning in large stocks with the S&P 500 as \na benchmark portfolio. Their database \nincludes a set of 37 monthly pairs of \nforecasts of alpha and beta values for \nbetween 646 and 771 stocks over the \nperiod December 1992 to December \n1995\u2014in all, 23,902 forecasts. The \ninvestment company policy was to \ntruncate alpha forecasts at  1 14% and \n 2 12% per month.  6   The histogram of \nthese forecasts is shown in  Figure\u00a027.3 . Returns of large stocks over these years were about \naverage, as shown in the following table, including one average year (1993), one bad year \n(1994), and one good year (1995):    \n The histogram shows that the distribution of alpha forecasts was positively skewed, \nwith a larger number of pessimistic forecasts. The adjusted  R -square in a regression of \nthese forecasts with actual alphas was .001134, implying a tiny correlation coefficient of \n.0337. As it turned out, the optimistic forecasts were of superior quality to the pessimistic \nones. When the regression allowed separate coefficients for positive and negative fore-\ncasts, the  R -square increased to .001536, and the correlation coefficient to .0392. \n These results contain \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d news. The \u201cgood\u201d news is that after adjusting \neven the wildest forecast, say, an alpha of 12% for the next month, the value to be used by \na forecaster when  R -square is .001 would be .012%, just 1.2 basis points per month. On \nan annual basis, this would amount to .14%, which is of the order of the alpha forecasts \nof the example in  Spreadsheet\u00a027.1 . With forecasts of this small magnitude, the problem \nof extreme portfolio weights would never arise. The bad news arises from the same data: \nthe performance of the active portfolio will be no better than in our example\u2014implying an \n M -square of only 19 basis points. \n An investment company that delivers such limited performance will not be able to cover \nits cost.

As we show in Section 27.5, even small information ratios of individual stocks can \nadd up (see line 11 in  Table\u00a027.1 ). Thus, when many forecasts of even low precision are used to form a large active portfolio, large profits can be made. \n So far we have assumed that forecast errors of various stocks are independent, an \nassumption that may not be valid. When forecasts are correlated across stocks, precision is measured by a covariance matrix of forecasting errors, which can be estimated from past forecasts. While the necessary adjustment to the forecasts in this case is algebraically messy, it is just a technical detail. As we might guess, correlations among forecast errors will call for us to further shrink the adjusted forecasts toward zero.  \n  Organizational Structure and Performance \n The mathematical property of the optimal risky portfolio reveals a central feature of invest-ment companies, namely, economies of scale. From the Sharpe measure of the optimized portfolio shown in  Table\u00a027.1 , it is evident that performance as measured by the Sharpe ratio and  M -square grows monotonically with the squared information ratio of the active \nportfolio (see Equation 8.22, Chapter 8, for a review), which in turn is the sum of the squared information ratios of the covered securities (see Equation 8.24). Hence, a larger force of security analysts is sure to improve performance, at least before adjustment for cost. Moreover, a larger universe will also improve the diversification of the active port-folio and mitigate the need to hold positions in the neutral passive portfolio, perhaps even allowing a profitable short position in it. Additionally, a larger universe allows for an increase in the size of the fund without the need to trade larger blocks of single securities. Finally, as we will show in some detail in Section 27.5, increasing the universe of securi-ties creates another diversification effect, that of forecasting errors by analysts. \n The increases in the universe of the active portfolio in pursuit of better performance \nnaturally come at a cost, because security analysts of quality do not come cheap. However, the other units of the organization can handle increased activity with little increase in cost. All this suggests economies of scale for larger investment companies provided the organi-zational structure is efficient. \n Optimizing the risky portfolio entails a number of tasks of different nature in terms of \nexpertise and need for independence. As a result, the organizational chart of the portfolio management outfit requires a degree of decentralization and proper controls.  Figure\u00a027.4  shows an organizational chart designed to achieve these goals. The figure is largely self-explanatory and the structure is consistent with the theoretical considerations worked out in previous chapters. It can go a long way in forging sound underpinnings to the daily work of portfolio management. A few comments are in order, though.  \n The control units responsible for forecasting records and determining forecast adjust-\nments will directly affect the advancement and bonuses of security analysts and estimation experts. This implies that these units must be independent and insulated from organiza-tional pressures. \n An important issue is the conflict between independence of security analysts\u2019 opinions \nand the need for cooperation and coordination in the use of resources and contacts with corporate and government personnel. The relative size of the security analysis unit will further complicate the solution to this conflict. In contrast, the macro forecast unit might become  too  insulated from the security analysis unit. An effort to create an interface and \nchannels of communications between these units is warranted. \n Finally, econometric techniques that are invaluable to the organization have seen a \nquantum leap in sophistication in recent years, and this process seems still to be accelerat-ing. It is critical to keep the units that deal with estimation updated and on top of the latest developments.    \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   961bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   961 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n9 6 2 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n   27.3 The Black-Litterman Model \nProduct\nFinal Risky PortfolioCustomers\nControl\nIs \ufb01nal portfolio\nsuper-ef\ufb01cient?\nProduct\nActive PortfolioProduct\nPassive PortfolioData\nFeedbackFeedback\nFeedback\nControl\nIs alpha positive?Data\nFeedback\nDataPassive Portfolio Manager\nForm passive portfolio\nat minimum  costFeedback\nControl\nIs correlation\nwith market 1?Feedback\nFeedbackData\nMacro Analyst\nEstimate\nE(RM), \u03c3(M)Forecasts\nQuality Control\n1.

Merton,  Finance Theory,   Chapter 12, Harvard Business School. \n  Fischer Black, famous for the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula as well as the Treynor-\nBlack model, teamed up with Robert Litterman to produce another useful model of port-\nfolio construction. The Black-Litterman (BL) model allows portfolio managers to quantify \ncomplex forecasts (which they call    views   ) and apply these views to portfolio construction.  7\nWe begin the discussion of the BL model with an illustration of a simple problem of asset \nallocation. Although we devote the next section to a comparison of the two models, some \ncomments on commonalities of the models will help us better understand the BL model.   \n   Black-Litterman Asset Allocation Decision \n Consider a portfolio manager laboring over    asset allocation    to bills, bonds, and stocks \nfor the next month. The risky portfolio will be constructed from bonds and stocks so as to \nmaximize the Sharpe ratio. So far this is no more than the problem described in Section\u00a07.3 \n7 Black and Litterman, \u201cGlobal Portfolio Optimization.\u201d \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   962bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   962 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 27 The Theory of Active Portfolio Management 963\nof Chapter 7. There, we were concerned with optimizing the portfolio given a set of data \ninputs. In real life, however, optimization using a given dataset is the least of the manager\u2019s problems. The real issue that dogs any portfolio manager is how to come by that input data. Black and Litterman propose an approach that uses past data, equilibrium considerations, and the private views of the portfolio manager about the near future. \n Data enters the BL model from two sources: history and forecasts, called  views,  about \nthe future. The historical sample is used to estimate the covariance matrix of the asset classes involved in the asset allocation decision. The estimated covariance matrix, com-bined with a model of equilibrium returns (for example, the CAPM) is used to produce baseline forecasts that would be the basis of a passive strategy. In the next step, views are introduced and quantified. The views represent a departure from the baseline forecast and result in a revised set of expected returns. With the new set of inputs (just as with alpha forecasts in the Treynor-Black model), an optimal risky portfolio is designed to replace the (no-longer-efficient) passive portfolio.  \n  Step 1: The Covariance Matrix from Historical Data \n This straightforward task is the first in the chain that makes up the BL model. Suppose step\u00a01 results in the following annualized covariance matrix, estimated from recent his-torical excess returns:  \n Notice that step 1 is common to both the BL and the Treynor-Black (TB) models. This \nactivity appears in the organizational chart in  Figure\u00a027.4 .  \n  Step 2: Determination of a Baseline Forecast \n Because past data are of such limited use in inferring expected returns for the next month, BL propose an alternative approach. They start with a    baseline forecast    derived from the \nassumption that the market is in equilibrium where current prices of stocks and bonds reflect all available information and, as a result, the theoretical market portfolio with weights equal to market-value proportions is efficient. Suppose that current market values of outstanding bonds and stocks imply that the weight of bonds in the baseline portfolio is  w  \n B  \u00a0 5 \u00a0.25, and the weight of stocks is  w   S  \u00a0 5 \u00a0.75. When we apply these portfolio weights to \nthe covariance matrix from step 1, the variance of the baseline portfolio emerges as\n     V a r (RM)5wB2 Var(RB)1wS2 Var(RS)12wBwS Cov (RB, RS) (27.8)\n 5.2523.00643.7523.0289123.253.753.00408 5.018186    \n The CAPM equation (Equation 9.2 in Chapter 9) gives the relationship between the \nmarket portfolio risk (variance) and its risk premium (expected excess return) as\n    E(RM)5A3Var(RM)  (27.9)   \n where    A  is the average coefficient of risk aversion. Assuming    A53  yields the equilibrium \nrisk premium of the baseline portfolio as:  E ( R   M  )\u00a0 5 \u00a03\u00a0 3 \u00a0.018186\u00a0 5 \u00a0.0546\u00a0 5 \u00a05.46%.

This is a statement about the  precision  of these forecasts, which is different from \nthe covariance matrix of realized excess returns on the bond and stock portfolios. We are looking for the precision of the  estimate  of expected return, as opposed to the volatility of \nactual returns. A conventional rule of thumb in this application is to use a standard devia-tion that is 10% of the standard deviation of returns (or equivalently, a variance that is 1% of the return variance). To illustrate, imagine that the covariance matrix of actual return was estimated from the returns of the last 100 months. The variance of the average return (which is the forecast of the expected return) would then be 1% of the variance of the actual return. Hence in this case it would be correct to use .01 times the covariance matrix of returns for the expected return. Thus step 2 ends with a forecast and covariance matrix:  \n Now that we have backed out market expectations, it is time to integrate the manager\u2019s \nprivate views into our analysis.  \n  Step 3: Integrating the Manager\u2019s Private Views \n The BL model allows the manager to introduce any number of views about the baseline forecasts into the optimization process. Appended to the views, the manager specifies his degree of confidence in them. Views in the BL model are expressed as values of various linear combinations of excess returns, and confidence in them as a covariance matrix of errors in these values.

The manager\u2019s view is really  Q \u00a0 1 \u00a0\u00e1, where \u00e1 represents zero-mean \nerror in the view with a standard deviation that reflects the manager\u2019s less than perfect \nconfidence. Noticing that the standard deviation of the difference between the expected rates on stocks and bonds is 1.65% (calculated below in Equation 27.13), suppose that the manager assigns a value of  s (\u00e1)\u00a0 5 \u00a01.73%.  \n9   To summarize, if we denote the array of returns \nby  R \u00a0 5 \u00a0( R   B  ,\u00a0 R   S  ), then the manager\u2019s view,  P,  applied to these returns is  10  \n    PRT5Q1e\n P5(1, 21)\n R5(RB, RS)\n Q5.5%5.005\n  s2(e)5.017325.0003  (27.11)\n    \n  Step 4: Revised (Posterior) Expectations \n The baseline forecasts of expected returns derived from market values and their covari-\nance matrix comprise the prior distribution of the rates of return on bonds and stocks. The manager\u2019s view, together with its confidence measure, provides the probability distribution arising from the \u201cexperiment,\u201d that is, the additional information that must be optimally integrated with the prior distribution. The result is the posterior: a new set of expected returns, conditioned on the manager\u2019s views. \n To acquire intuition about the solution, consider what the baseline expected returns \nimply about the view. The expectations derived from market data were that the expected return on bonds is 1.40% and on stocks 6.81%. Therefore, the baseline view is that  E ( R  \n B  )\u00a0 2  \n E ( R   S  )\u00a0 5 \u00a0 2 5.41%. In contrast, the manager thinks this difference is  Q \u00a0 5 \u00a0 R   B  \u00a0 2 \u00a0 R   S  \u00a0 5 \u00a0.5%. \nUsing the BL linear-equation notation for market expectations:\n    QE5PRET\n P5(1, 21)\n RE53E(RB), E(RS)45(1.40%, 6.81% )\n  QE51.4026.8152 5.41%   (27.12)\n   \n  8 A simpler view that bonds will return 3% is also legitimate. In that case  P \u00a0 5 \u00a0(1,\u00a00) and the view is really like an \nalpha forecast in the Treynor-Black model. If all views were like this simple one, there would be no difference \nbetween the TB and BL models. \n  9 Absent specific information shedding light on the SD of the view, for example, the track record of the source of \nthe view, the SD calculated from the covariance matrix of the baseline forecasts is commonly used. In that case, \nthe SD would be that of  Q   E   in Equation 27.13:    s(QE)5\".0002714 5.0165 (1.65% ).  \n  10 Notice that the view is expressed as a row vector with as many elements as there are risky assets (here, two) \napplied to the row vector of returns. The manager\u2019s view ( Q ) is obtained from the vector,  P,  marking the assets \nincluded in the view, times their actual returns. We denote the return row vector,  R,  with a superscript \u201c T \u201d (for \ntranspose\u2014turning a row vector into a column), and therefore compute the \u201csumproduct\u201d of the two vectors.  More generally, any view that is a linear combination of the relevant excess returns \ncan be presented as an array (in Excel, an array would be a column of numbers) that  multiplies another array (column) of excess returns. In this case, the array of weights is \n P \u00a0 5 \u00a0(1,\u00a0 2 1) and the array of excess returns is ( R  \n B  ,\u00a0 R   S  ). The value of this linear combina-\ntion, denoted  Q,  reflects the manager\u2019s view. In this case,  Q \u00a0 5 \u00a0.5% must be taken into \naccount in optimizing the portfolio.  8    \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   965bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   965 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n966 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n Thus, the baseline \u201cview\u201d is  2 5.41% (i.e., stocks will outperform bonds), which is vastly \ndifferent from the manager\u2019s view.

The difference between the expected returns on stocks and bonds is reduced from 5.41% to 2.60%. While this is a very large change, we also realize that the manager\u2019s private view that  Q  5 .5% has been greatly \ntempered by the prior distribution to a value roughly halfway between his private view and the baseline view. In general, the degree of compromise between views will depend on the precision assigned to them. \n The example we have described contains only two assets and one view. It can easily be \ngeneralized to any number of assets with any number of views about future returns. The views can be more complex than a simple difference between a pair of returns. Views can assign a value to  any  linear combination of the assets in the universe, and the confidence \nlevel (the covariance matrix of the set of \u00e1 values of the views) can allow for dependence across views. This flexibility gives the model great potential by quantifying a rich set of information that is unique to a portfolio manager. Appendix B to the chapter presents the general BL model.  \n  Step 5: Portfolio Optimization \n At this point, the portfolio optimization follows the Markowitz procedure of Chapter 7, with an input list that replaces baseline expectations with the conditional expectations  arising from the manager\u2019s view. \n  Spreadsheet\u00a027.2  presents the calculations of the BL model.

The weight in bonds declines as the confidence in the view falls (the SD of \nthe view increases). With no confidence in the view (SD very large), the weight in bonds falls to 0.3, determined by the baseline forecast. At this point, the portfolio is passive; its  M -square is zero.   \n Notice that the  M -square profile is asymmetric. With great confidence in the view and the \nresultant large position in bonds, the gain in  M -square when the view is correct is smaller \nthan the loss in  M -square when the view is incorrect. With less confidence and therefore \na smaller position in bonds, the \u201cgame\u201d becomes more symmetric between a correct and \nincorrect view. Since determination of the SD of a view is quite abstract, the graph tells us that to err on the side of skepticism may well be the prudent choice.    \n   27.4 Treynor-Black versus Black-Litterman: \nComplements, Not Substitutes \n  Treynor, Black, and Litterman have earned a place among the important innovators of the \ninvestments industry. Wide implementation of their models could contribute much to the industry. The comparative analysis of their models presented here is not aimed at elevating one at the expense of the other\u2014in any case, we find them complementary\u2014but rather to clarify the relative merits of each. \n First and foremost, once you reach the optimization stage, the models are identical. Put \ndifferently, if users of either model arrive at identical input lists, they will choose identical portfolios and realize identical performance measures. In Section 27.6, we show that these levels of performance should be far superior to passive strategies, as well as to active strat-egies that do not take advantage of the quantitative techniques of these models. The models differ primarily in the way they arrive at the input list, and analysis of these differences shows that the models are true complements and are best used in tandem.  \n   The BL Model as Icing on the TB Cake \n The Treynor-Black (TB) model is really oriented to individual security analysis. This can be seen from the way the active portfolio is constructed. The alpha values assigned to securities must be determined relative to the passive portfolio. This portfolio is the one that would be held if all alpha values turned out to be zero. Now suppose an investment com-pany prospectus mandates a portfolio invested 70% in a U.S. universe of large stocks, say, the S&P 500, and 30% in a well-defined universe of large European stocks. In that case, the macro analysis of the organization would have to be split, and the TB model would have to be run as two separate divisions. In each division, security analysts would compile values of alpha relative to their own passive portfolio. The product of this organization would thus include four portfolios, two passive and two active. This scheme is workable only when the portfolios are optimized separately. That is, the parameters (alpha, beta, and residual variance) of U.S. securities are estimated relative to the U.S. benchmark, while the parameters of European stocks are estimated relative to the European benchmark. Then the final portfolio would be constructed as a standard problem in asset allocation. \n The resulting portfolio could be improved using the BL approach. First, views about the \nrelative performance of the U.S. and European markets can be expected to add informa-tion to the independent macro forecasts for the two economies. For reasons of specializa-tion, the U.S. and European macro analysts must focus on their respective economies. Obviously, when more country or regional portfolios are added to the company\u2019s universe, \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   968bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   968 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 27 The Theory of Active Portfolio Management 969\nthe need for decentralization becomes more compelling, and the potential of applying the \nBL model to the TB product greater. Moreover, the foreign-stock portfolios will result in various positions in local currencies. This is a clear area of international finance and the only way to import forecasts from this analysis is with the BL technique.  \n11     \n  Why Not Replace the Entire TB Cake with the BL Icing? \n This question is raised by the need to use the BL technique if the overall portfolio is to include forecasts from comparative economic and international finance analyses. It is indeed possible to use the BL model for the entire process of constructing the efficient portfolio. The reason is that the alpha compiled for the TB model can be replaced with BL views. To take a simple example, suppose only one security makes up the active portfolio. With the TB model, we have macro forecasts,  E ( R  \n M  ) and  s   M  , as well as alpha, beta, and \nresidual variance for the active portfolio. This input list also can be represented in the \n following form, along the lines of the BL framework:\n   R53E(RM), E(RA)5bAE(RM)4\nP5\u00a20, 11aA\nbAE(RM)\u2264\nPRT5Q1e5a A1e\nQE50\nD5aA\ns2(e)5Var(forecastin g error ) in Equation 27.6\n s2(D)5s2(e)1s2(e)   (27.15)\n   \n where  e  is the residual in the SCL regression of Equation 27.5. Calculation of the condi-tional expectations from Equation 27.15 as in Equation 27.13 will bring us to the same adjusted alpha as in Equation 27.7 of the TB model. \n In this light, the BL model can be viewed as a generalization of the TB model. The BL \nmodel allows you to adjust expected return from views about alpha values as in the TB model, but it also allows you to express views about  relative  performance that cannot be \nincorporated in the TB model. \n However, this conclusion might produce a false impression that is consequential to \ninvestment management. To understand the point, we first discuss the degree of confi-dence, which is essential to fully represent a view in the BL model.  Spreadsheet\u00a027.2  and  Figure\u00a027.5  illustrate that the optimal portfolio weights and performance are highly sensi-tive to the degree of confidence in the BL views. Thus, the validity of the model rests in large part on the way the confidence about views is arrived at. \n When a BL view is structured to replace a direct alpha estimate in a TB framework, \nwe must use the variance of the forecasting error taken from Equation 27.7 and applied to Equation 27.15. This is how \u201cconfidence\u201d is quantified in the BL model. Whereas in the TB framework one can measure forecast accuracy by computing the correlation between analysts\u2019 alpha forecasts and subsequent realizations, such a procedure is not as easily applied to BL views about relative performance. Managers\u2019 views may be expressed about different quantities in different time periods, and, therefore, we will not have long forecast histories on a particular variable with which to assess accuracy. To our knowledge, no promotion of how to quantify \u201cconfidence\u201d appears in academic or industry publications about the BL model. \n  11 The BL model can also be used to introduce views about relative performance of various U.S and foreign \ncorporations. \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   969bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   969 7/31/13   7:24 PM7/31/13   7:24 PMFinal PDF to printer\n970 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n This raises the issue of adjusting forecasts in the TB model. We are not aware of actual \nresults where analysts\u2019 track records are systematically compiled and used to adjust alpha \nforecasts, although we cannot assert that such effort is nowhere expended. However, indi-rect evidence suggests that alphas are usually not adjusted, leading to the common \u201ccom-plaint\u201d that the TB model is not applied in the field because it results in \u201cwild\u201d portfolio weights. Yet, as we saw in Section 27.3, those wild portfolio weights are a consequence of failing to adjust alpha values to reflect forecast precision. Any realistic  R -square that can \nbe obtained even by excellent forecasters will result in moderate portfolio weights. Even when \u201cwild\u201d weights do occasionally materialize, they can be \u201ctamed\u201d by a straightfor-ward restriction on the variance of the tracking error. \n It is therefore useful to keep the two models separate and distinct; the TB model for the \nmanagement of security analysis with proper adjustment of forecasts and the BL model for asset allocation where views about relative performance are useful  despite  the fact that the \ndegree of confidence must in practice be inaccurately estimated.    \n  12 Alex Kane, Alan Marcus, and Robert R. Trippi, \u201cThe Valuation of Security Analysis,\u201d  Journal of Portfolio \nManagement  25 (Spring 1999).    27.5 The Value of Active Management \n  We showed in Chapter 24 that the value of successful market timing is enormous. Even a forecaster with far-from-perfect predictive power would contribute significant value.  Nevertheless, active portfolio management based on security analysis has even greater potential. Even if each individual security analyst has only modest forecasting power, the power of a  portfolio  of analysts is potentially unbounded.  \n   A Model for the Estimation of Potential Fees \n The value of market timing was derived from the value of an equivalent number of call options that mimic the return to the timer\u2019s portfolio. Thus, we were able to derive an unambiguous market value to timing ability, that is, we could price the implicit call in the timer\u2019s services. We cannot get quite that far with valuation of active portfolio manage-ment, but we can do the next best thing, namely, we can calculate what a representative investor would pay for such services. \n Kane, Marcus, and Trippi  \n12   derive an annuitized value of portfolio performance mea-\nsured as a percentage of funds under management. The percentage fee,  f,  that investors \nwould be willing to pay for active services can be related to the difference between the square of the portfolio Sharpe ratio and that of the passive portfolio as \n    \nf5(SP22SM2)/2A  (27.16)   \n where  A  is the coefficient of the investor\u2019s risk aversion. \n The source of the power of the active portfolio is the additive value of the squared    infor-\nmation ratios       \u00a2ai\ns(ei)\u2264  and precision of individual analysts. Recall the expression for the \nsquare of the Sharpe ratio of the optimized risky portfolio:\n   SP25SM21an\ni51Bai\ns(ei)R2\n  \n Therefore,\n    f51\n2Aan\ni51Bai\ns(ei)R2\n  (27.17)   \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   970bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   970 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 27 The Theory of Active Portfolio Management 971\n Thus, the fee that can be charged,  f,  depends on three factors: (1) the coefficient of risk \naversion, (2) the distribution of the squared information ratio in the universe of securities, \nand (3) the precision of the security analysts. Notice that this fee is in excess of what an \nindex fund would charge. If an index fund charges about 20 basis points, the active manager \ncould charge incremental fees above that level by the percentage given in Equation\u00a027.17.  \n  Results from the Distribution of Actual Information Ratios \n Kane, Marcus, and Trippi investigated the distribution of the squared IR for all S&P 500 \nstocks over two 5-year periods and estimated that this (annualized) expectation,  E (IR 2 ), is in \nthe range of .845 to 1.122. With a coefficient of risk aversion of 3, a portfolio manager who \ncovers 100 stocks with security analysts whose  R -square of forecasts with realized alpha is \nonly .001 would still be able to charge an annual fee that is 4.88% higher than that of an index \nfund. This fee is based on the lower end of the range of the expected squared information ratio. \n One limitation of this study is that it assumes that the portfolio manager knows the \nquality of the forecasts, however low they may be. As we have seen, portfolio weights are \nsensitive to forecast quality, and when that quality is estimated with error, performance \nwill be further reduced.  \n  Results from Distribution of Actual Forecasts \n A study of actual forecasts by Kane, Kim, and White (see footnote 5) found the distribution \nof over 11,000 alpha forecasts for over 600 stocks over 37 months presented in  Figure\u00a027.3 . \nThe average forecast precision from this database of forecasts provided an  R -square of \n.00108 using ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and .00151 when allowing separate \ncoefficients for positive and negative forecasts. These are only marginally better than the \nprecision used to interpret the Kane, Marcus, and Trippi study of the distribution of real-\nized information value. Kane, Kim, and White use these  R -squares to adjust the forecasts \nin their database and form optimal portfolios from 105 stocks selected randomly from the \n646 covered by the investment company. \n Kane, Kim, and White assume that forecast quality is the same each month for all \nalpha forecasts for the 105 stocks, but act as though they do not know that quality. Thus, \nthe adjustment process is performed each month by using past forecasts. This introduces \nanother source of estimation error that compounds the difficulty of low forecast quality. To \ndull the impact of this real-life difficulty, the estimation of forecast quality adopts improved \neconometric technique. They find that least absolute deviation (LAD) regressions perform \nuniformly better than OLS regressions. The optimization model used both the diagonal \nindex model (as in TB) as well as the full-covariance model (the Markowitz algorithm). \n The annualized  M -square measures of performance are shown in  Table\u00a0 27.6 . The \n M -square values, which range from 2.67% to 6.31%, are quite impressive. The results in \n Table\u00a027.6  also show that using the residual covariance matrix can significantly improve \nperformance when many stocks are covered, contrary to the small difference when only six \nstocks are covered, as in Spreadsheet 8.1 of Chapter 8.   \n  Forecast Adjustment    Diagonal Model    Covariance Model  \n Line *   2.67  3.01 \n Kinked **   4.25  6.31 \n  *Same coefficients for positive and negative forecasts.  \n  **Different coefficients for positive and negative forecasts.

To avoid estimation techniques that may not be \navailable to portfolio managers, all estimates in this study are obtained from OLS regressions.  \n The portfolio manager in the simulation must deploy a full-blown \u201corganizational struc-\nture\u201d to capture performance under realistic conditions. At any point, the manager uses \nonly past returns and past forecast records to produce forward-looking estimates which \ninclude (1) the benchmark risk premium and standard deviation, (2) beta coefficients for \nthe stocks in the active portfolio, and (3) the forecasting quality of each security analyst. At \nthis point, the manager receives a set of alpha forecasts from the security analysts and pro-\nceeds to construct the optimal portfolio. The portfolio is optimized on the basis of macro \nforecasts for the benchmark portfolio, and alpha forecasts adjusted for quality using the \npast record of performance for each analyst. Finally, the next month returns are simulated \nand the performance of the portfolio is recorded. \n  Table\u00a027.7  summarizes the results for portfolios when, unbeknownst to the portfolio \nmanager, security-analyst forecasts are generated with an  R -square of .001.  M -square \nclearly increases when performance records are longer. The results also show that, in gen-\neral, performance improves with the size of the portfolio.  \n The results of all three studies show that even the smallest forecast ability can result \nin greatly improved performance. Moreover, with better estimation techniques, perfor-\nmance can be further enhanced. We believe that one reason the proposed procedures are \nnot widely used in the industry is that security analysts believe that low individual correla-\ntions imply low aggregate forecasting value and thus wish to avoid the estimation of their \nabilities. We hope that results of studies of the type discussed here will lure investment \ncompanies to adopt these techniques and move the industry to new levels of performance.    \n    Forecast Record (months)  \n  Stocks in Portfolio    36    48    60  \n 100  0.96  3.12   6.36 \n 300  0.60  5.88  12.72 \n 500  3.00  5.88  15.12  Table 27.7 \nM -square of simulated \nportfolios \n13 Alex Kane, Tae-Hwan Kim, and Halbert White, \u201cForecast Precision and Portfolio Performance,\u201d Journal of \nFinancial Econometrics,  (2010) 8 (3).    27.6 Concluding Remarks on Active Management \n  A common concern of students of investments who encounter a heavy dose of theory laced \nwith math and statistics is whether the analytical approach is necessary or even useful. \nHere are some observations that should allay any such concern. Investment theory has \ndeveloped in recent decades at a galloping pace. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, the distance \nbetween the basic science of investments and industry practice, one that exists in any field, \nbod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   972bod61671_ch27_951-976.indd   972 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 27 The Theory of Active Portfolio Management 973\nhas actually narrowed in recent years. This satisfying trend is due at least in part to the \n vigorous growth of the CFA Institute. The CFA designation has become nearly a prerequi-site to success in the industry, and the number of individuals seeking it already exceeds that of finance-major MBAs. They continuously contribute to the proximity between invest-ments science and the industry. \n Even more important is the zeal of the Institute in advancing and enriching the cur-\nriculum of the CFA degree and taking it ever closer to contemporary investment theory. Indeed, finance professors indirectly benefit from this curriculum, because they can argue the practicality of the text material by pointing out that it is part of the body of knowledge required of CFA candidates. \n Yet there is one area in which practice still lags far behind theory, and that is the subject \nof this chapter\u2014this despite the fact that TB and BL models have been around since 1973 and 1992, respectively. Yet, as we have seen, these models have to date failed to materially penetrate the industry. We speculated on the reason for this failure in the previous section. We hope, however, that we will be forced to discard this paragraph from future editions due to obsolescence. \n Finally, there is little time in the already dense investments curriculum to discuss the \nwelfare implication of nearly efficient security prices. Prices can reach such levels only when investors optimize portfolios with high-quality analysis and implementation. The value of nearly efficient prices to the welfare of the economy is enormous, competing in importance with advances in technology. High-quality active management therefore can contribute to society even as it enriches its practitioners.    \n   SUMMARY           1 .  Treynor-Black portfolio weights are sensitive to large alpha values, which can result in practically \ninfeasible long/short portfolio positions.  \n   2 .  Benchmark portfolio risk, the variance of the return difference between the portfolio and the benchmark, can be constrained to keep the TB portfolio within reasonable weights.  \n   3 .  Alpha forecasts must be shrunk (adjusted toward zero) to account for less-than-perfect forecast-ing quality. Compiling past analyst forecasts and subsequent realizations allows one to estimate the correlation between realizations and forecasts. Regression analysis can be used to measure the forecast quality and guide the proper adjustment of future forecasts. When alpha forecasts are scaled back to account for forecast imprecision, the resulting portfolio positions become far more moderate.  \n   4 .  The Black-Litterman model allows the private views of the portfolio manager to be incorporated with market data in the optimization procedure.  \n   5 .  The Treynor-Black and Black-Litterman models are complementary tools. Both should be used: the TB model is more geared toward security analysis while the BL model more naturally fits asset allocation problems.  \n   6 .  Even low-quality forecasts are valuable. Imperceptible  R -squares of only .001 in regressions of \nrealizations on analysts\u2019 forecasts can be used to substantially improve portfolio performance.

It is assumed that the excess returns are normally distributed. \n Market values of the universe assets are obtained and used to compute the 1\u00a0 3 \u00a0 n  vector \nof weights  w   M   in the baseline equilibrium portfolio.

The task is equally difficult for institutions, most of which have many stakeholders and often are regulated by various authorities. The investment process is not easily reduced to a simple or mechanical algorithm. \n While many principles of investments are \nquite general and apply to virtually all inves-\ntors, some issues are peculiar to the specific investor. For example, tax bracket, age, risk tolerance, wealth, job prospects, and uncer-tainties make each investor\u2019s circumstances somewhat unique. In this chapter we focus on the process by which investors systematically review their particular objectives, constraints, and circumstances. Along the way, we sur-vey some of the major classes of institutional investors and examine the special issues they must confront. \n Of course, there is no unique \u201ccorrect\u201d \ninvestment process. However, some approaches \nare better than others, and it can be helpful to take one high-quality approach as a useful case study. For this reason, we will examine the systematic approach suggested by the CFA Institute. Among other things, the Institute administers examinations to certify investment professionals as Chartered Financial Analysts. Therefore, the approach we outline is also one that a highly respected professional group endorses through the curriculum that it requires investment practitioners to master. \n The basic framework involves dividing the \ninvestment process into four stages: specify-\ning objectives, specifying constraints, for-mulating policy, and later monitoring and updating the portfolio as needed. We will treat each of these activities in turn. We start with a description of the major types of inves-tors, both individual and institutional, as well as their special objectives. We turn next to the constraints or circumstances peculiar to each investor class, and we consider some of the investment policies that each can choose. \n We will examine how the special circum-\nstances of both individuals as well as institu-\ntions such as pension funds affect investment decisions. We also will see how the tax system can impart a substantial effect on investment decisions.

Figure\u00a028.1  \nand  Table\u00a028.1  describe the steps in that process. As shorthand, you might think of  plan-\nning  as focused largely on establishing all the inputs necessary for decision making. These \ninclude data about the client as well as the capital market, resulting in very broad policy \nguidelines (the strategic asset allocation).  Execution   fleshes out the details of optimal asset \nallocation and security selection. Finally,  feedback   is the process of adapting to changes in \nexpectations and objectives as well as to changes in portfolio composition that result from \nchanges in market prices.  \n The result of this analysis can be summarized in an Investment Policy Statement \naddressing the topics specified in  Table\u00a028.2 . In the next sections we elaborate on the steps \nleading to such an Investment Policy Statement. We start with the planning phase, the first \npanel of  Table\u00a028.1 .  \n   Objectives \n  Table\u00a028.1  indicates that the management planning process starts off by analyzing one\u2019s \ninvestment clients\u2014in particular, by considering the objectives and constraints that gov-\nern their decisions. Portfolio objectives center on the    risk\u2013return trade-off    between the \nexpected return the investors want ( return requirements   in the first column of  Table\u00a028.3 ) \nand how much risk they are willing to assume ( risk tolerance  ). Investment managers must \nknow the level of risk that can be tolerated in the pursuit of a higher expected rate of return. \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   978bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   978 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n Risk Tolerance Questionnaire \n Here is an example of a short quiz that may be used by financial institutions to help estimate risk tolerance. \nyourself a  moderate investor.

Table\u00a028.4  lists factors governing return requirements and risk attitudes for each of the seven major investor categories we will discuss.   \n  Individual Investors \n The basic factors affecting individual investor return requirements and risk tolerance are life-cycle stage and individual preferences. A middle-aged tenured professor will have a different set of needs and preferences from a retired widow, for example. We will have much more to say about individual investors later in this chapter.  \n  Personal Trusts \n    Personal trusts    are established when an individual confers legal title to property to another person or institution (the trustee) to manage that property for one or more benefi-ciaries. Beneficiaries customarily are divided into    income beneficiaries    ,  who receive the \ninterest and dividend income from the trust during their lifetimes, and    remaindermen    ,  \nwho receive the principal of the trust when the income beneficiary dies and the trust is dissolved. The trustee is usually a bank, a savings and loan association, a lawyer, or an \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   979bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   979 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n9 8 0 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nI.

Investment of a trust is subject to trust laws, as well as \u201cprudent \ninvestor\u201d rules that limit the types of allowable trust investment to those that a prudent \nperson would select. \n Objectives for personal trusts normally are more limited in scope than those of the \n individual investor. Because of their fiduciary responsibility, personal trust managers \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   980bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   980 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 981\ntypically are more risk averse than are individual investors. Certain asset classes such as \noptions and futures contracts, for example, and strategies such as short-selling or buying \non margin are ruled out.  \n  Mutual Funds \n Mutual funds are pools of investors\u2019 money. They invest in ways specified in their pro-\nspectuses and issue shares to investors entitling them to a pro rata portion of the income \ngenerated by the funds.   The return requirement and risk tolerance across mutual funds are \nhighly variable because funds segment the investor market. Various funds appeal to distinct \ninvestor groups and will adopt a return requirement and risk tolerance that fit a particular \nmarket niche. For example, income funds cater to the conservative investor, while high-\ngrowth funds seek out the more risk-tolerant ones. Tax-free bond funds segment the market \nby tax bracket.  \n  Pension Funds \n Pension fund objectives depend on the type of pension plan. There are two basic types: \n  defined contribution plans    and    defined benefit plans  .  Defined contribution plans are \nin effect tax-deferred retirement savings accounts established by the firm in trust for its \nemployees, with the employee bearing all the risk and receiving all the return from the \nplan\u2019s assets. \n In defined benefit plans, by contrast, the employer has an obligation to provide a speci-\nfied annual retirement benefit. That benefit is defined by a formula that typically takes \ninto account years of service and the level of salary or wages. For example, the employer \nmay pay the retired employee a yearly amount equal to 2% of the employee\u2019s final annual \nsalary for each year of service. A 30-year employee would then receive an annual benefit \nequal to 60% of his or her final salary. The payments are an obligation of the employer, and \nthe assets in the pension fund provide collateral for the promised benefits. If the investment \nperformance of the assets is poor, the firm is obligated to make up the shortfall by contrib-\nuting additional assets to the fund. In contrast to defined contribution plans, the risk sur-\nrounding investment performance in defined benefit plans is borne by the firm. We discuss \npension plans more fully later in this chapter.  \nType of Investor Return Requirement Risk Tolerance\nIndividual and personal trusts Life cycle (education, children, retirement) Life cycle (younger are more risk \ntolerant)\nMutual funds Variable Variable\nPension funds Assumed actuarial rate Depends on proximity of payouts\nEndowment funds Determined by current income needs and \nneed for asset growth to maintain real valueGenerally conservative\nLife insurance companies Should exceed new money rate by sufficient \nmargin to meet expenses and profit \nobjectives; also actuarial rates importantConservative\nNon\u2013life insurance companies No minimum Conservative\nBanks Interest spread Variable\n Table 28.4 \n Matrix of objectives \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   981bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   981 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n982 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  Endowment Funds \n    Endowment funds    are organizations chartered to use their money for specific nonprofit \npurposes. They are financed by gifts from one or more sponsors and are typically managed by educational, cultural, and charitable organizations or by independent foundations estab-lished solely to carry out the fund\u2019s specific purposes. Generally, the investment objectives of an endowment fund are to produce a steady flow of income subject to only a moderate degree of risk. Trustees of an endowment fund, however, can specify other objectives as dictated by the circumstances of the particular endowment fund.  \n  Life Insurance Companies \n Life insurance companies generally try to invest so as to hedge their liabilities, which are defined by the policies they write. Thus there are as many objectives as there are distinct types of policies. Until the 1980s, there were for all practical purposes only two types of life insurance policies available for individuals: whole-life and term. \n A    whole-life insurance policy    combines a death benefit with a kind of savings plan \nthat provides for a gradual buildup of cash value that the policyholder can withdraw at a later point in life, usually at age 65.    Term insurance    ,  on the other hand, provides death \nbenefits only, with no buildup of cash value. \n The interest rate that is embedded in the schedule of cash value accumulation promised \nunder a whole-life policy is a fixed rate, and life insurance companies try to hedge this liability by investing in long-term bonds. Often the insured individual has the right to bor-row at a prespecified fixed interest rate against the cash value of the policy. \n During the inflationary years of the 1970s and early 1980s, when many older whole-life \npolicies carried contractual borrowing rates far lower than those available in the capital markets, policyholders borrowed heavily against the cash value to invest in money market mutual funds paying double-digit yields. In response to these developments the insurance industry came up with two new policy types:    variable life    and    universal life    .  Under a \nvariable life policy the insured\u2019s premium buys a fixed death benefit plus a cash value that can be invested in a variety of mutual funds from which the policyholder can choose. With a universal life policy, policyholders can increase or reduce the premium or death ben-efit according to their needs. Furthermore, the interest rate on the cash value component changes with market interest rates. The great advantage of variable and universal life insur-ance policies is that earnings on the cash value are not taxed until the money is withdrawn.  \n  Non\u2013Life Insurance Companies \n Non\u2013life insurance companies such as property and casualty insurers have investable funds primarily because they pay claims  after  they collect policy premiums. Typically, \nthey are conservative in their attitude toward risk. A common thread in the objectives of pension plans and insurance companies is the need to hedge predictable long-term liabili-ties. Investment strategies typically call for hedging these liabilities with bonds of various maturities.  \n  Banks \n The defining characteristic of banks is that most of their investments are loans to  businesses and consumers and most of their liabilities are accounts of depositors. Banks earn profit from the interest rate spread between loans extended (the bank\u2019s assets) and deposits and CDs (the bank\u2019s liabilities), as well as from fees for services. Man-aging bank assets calls for balancing the loan portfolio with the portfolio of deposits \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   982bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   982 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 983\nand CDs. A bank can increase the interest rate spread by lending to riskier borrowers and \nby increasing the proportion of longer-term loans. However, bank capital regulations are \nrisk-based, so higher-risk strategies will elicit higher capital requirements as well as the \npossibility of greater regulatory interference in the bank\u2019s affairs.    \n   28.2 Constraints \n  Even with identical attitudes toward risk, different households and institutions might \nchoose different investment portfolios because of their differing circumstances. These cir-\ncumstances include tax status, requirements for liquidity or a flow of income from the \nportfolio, or various regulatory restrictions. These circumstances impose constraints on \ninvestor choice. Together, objectives and constraints determine investment policy. \n As noted, constraints usually have to do with investor circumstances. For example, if a \nfamily has children about to enter college, there will be a high demand for liquidity since \ncash will be needed to pay tuition bills. Other times, however, constraints are imposed \nexternally. For example, banks and trusts are subject to legal limitations on the types of \nassets they may hold in their portfolios. Finally, some constraints are self-imposed. For \nexample,  social investing   means that investors will not hold shares of firms involved in \nethically objectionable activities. Some criteria that have been used to judge firms as ineli-\ngible for a portfolio are involvement in countries with human rights abuses, production of \ntobacco or alcohol, and participation in polluting activities.  Table\u00a028.5  presents a matrix \nsummarizing the main constraints in each category for each of the seven types of investors.  \n   Liquidity \n  Liquidity    is the ease (and speed) with which an asset can be sold and still fetch a fair price. \nIt is a relationship between the time dimension (how long will it take to sell) and the price \ndimension (any discount from fair market price) of an investment asset. (See the discussion \nof liquidity in Chapter 9.) \n When an actual concrete measure of liquidity is necessary, one thinks of the discount \nwhen an immediate sale is unavoidable. Cash and money market instruments such as \nTreasury bills and commercial paper, where the bid-ask spread is a small fraction of 1%, \nare the most liquid assets, and real estate is among the least liquid. Office buildings and \nmanufacturing structures can potentially experience a 50% liquidity discount. \n Table 28.5 \n Matrix of constraints Type of Investor Liquidity Horizon Regulations Taxes\nIndividuals and personal trusts Variable Life cycle None Variable\nMutual funds High Variable Few None\nPension funds Young, low; mature, high Long ERISA None\nEndowment funds Low Long Few None\nLife insurance companies Low Long Complex Yes\nNon\u2013life insurance companies High Short Few Yes\nBanks High Short Changing Yes\nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   983bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   983 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n984 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n Both individual and institutional investors must consider how likely they are to dispose \nof assets at short notice. From this likelihood, they establish the minimum level of liquid \nassets they want in the investment portfolio.  \n  Investment Horizon \n This is the  planned  liquidation date of the investment or substantial part of it. Examples of \nan individual    investment horizon    could be the time to fund a child\u2019s college education or \nthe retirement date for a wage earner. For a university endowment, an investment horizon could relate to the time to fund a major campus construction project. Horizon needs to be considered when investors choose between assets of various maturities, such as bonds, which pay off at specified future dates. For example, the maturity date of a bond might make it a more attractive investment if it coincides with a date on which cash is needed. This idea is analogous to the matching principle from corporate finance: Strive to match financing maturity to the economic life of the financed asset.  \n  Regulations \n Only professional and institutional investors are constrained by regulations. First and foremost is the    prudent investor rule    .  That is, professional investors who manage other \npeople\u2019s money have a fiduciary responsibility to restrict investment to assets that would have been approved by a prudent investor. The law is purposefully nonspecific. Every pro-fessional investor must stand ready to defend an investment policy in a court of law, and interpretation may differ according to the standards of the times. \n Also, specific regulations apply to various institutional investors. For instance, U.S. mutual \nfunds (institutions that pool individual investor money under professional management) may not hold more than 5% of the shares of any publicly traded corporation. This regulation keeps professional investors from getting involved in the actual management of corporations.  \n  Tax Considerations \n Tax consequences are central to investment decisions. The performance of any investment strategy is measured by how much it yields after taxes. For household and institutional investors who face significant tax rates, tax sheltering and deferral of tax obligations may be pivotal in their investment strategy.  \n  Unique Needs \n Virtually every investor faces special circumstances. Imagine husband-and-wife aeronauti-cal engineers holding high-paying jobs in the same aerospace corporation. The entire human capital of that household is tied to a single player in a rather cyclical industry. This couple would need to hedge the risk of a deterioration of the economic well-being of the aerospace industry by investing in assets that will yield more if such deterioration materializes. \n Similar issues would confront an executive on Wall Street who owns an apartment near \nwork. Because the value of the home in that part of Manhattan probably depends on the vitality of the securities industry, the individual is doubly exposed to the vagaries of the stock market. Because both job and home already depend on the fortunes of Wall Street, the purchase of a typical diversified stock portfolio would actually increase the exposure to the stock market. \n These examples illustrate that the job, or more generally, human capital, is often an \nindividual\u2019s biggest \u201casset,\u201d and the unique risk profile that results from employment can play a big role in determining a suitable investment portfolio. \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   984bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   984 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 985\n Other unique needs of individuals often center around their stage in the life cycle, as \ndiscussed below. Retirement, housing, and children\u2019s education constitute three major \ndemands for funds, and investment policy will depend in part on the proximity of these expenditures. \n Institutional investors also face unique needs. For example, pension funds will differ in \ntheir investment policy, depending on the average age of plan participants. Another exam-ple of a unique need for an institutional investor would be a university whose trustees allow the administration to use only cash income from the endowment fund. This constraint would translate into a preference for high-dividend-paying assets.    \n   28.3 Policy Statements  1  \n    An investment policy statement (IPS) serves as a strategic guide to the planning and imple-mentation of an investment program. When implemented successfully, the IPS anticipates issues related to governance of the investment program, planning for appropriate asset allocation, implementing an investment program with internal and/or external managers, monitoring the results, risk management, and appropriate reporting. The IPS also estab-lishes accountability for the various entities that may work on behalf of an investor. Per-haps most important, the IPS serves as a policy guide that can offer an objective course of action to be followed during periods of disruption when emotional or instinctive responses might otherwise motivate less prudent actions. \n The nearby box suggests desirable components of an Investment Policy Statement for \nuse with individual and/or high net worth investors. Not every component will be appropri-ate for every investor or every situation, and there may be other components that are desir-able for inclusion reflecting unique investor circumstances.   \n   Sample Policy Statements for Individual Investors \n Perhaps the best way to get a concrete feel for deriving actual policy statements is to con-sider a sample of such statements for a variety of investors. Therefore, we next present several examples. \n     1.   Scope and Purpose \n    1a.   Define the context:  \n  A preamble is often useful to relate information about the investor and/or the source of wealth as a way of establishing the context in which an investment program will be implemented. \n  Example: The assets of the Leveaux family trusts trace back to the establish-\nment of Leveaux Vintners in 1902 by Claude Leveaux. Over the course of the next 77 years, three generations of the Leveaux family worked to grow the fam-ily business to include distilled spirits, gourmet snack foods, and the LVX chain of cafes in Europe and Canada. Each business line was committed to delivering outstanding quality and value to consumers, as well as investing in the commu-nities in which Leveaux did business. In 1979, LVX Industries was purchased by the British conglomerate FoodCo for the equivalent of US$272 million. Michelle Leveaux established the Leveaux Foundation with $100 million of the sale proceeds, and much of the remainder constituted the Leveaux Family Trusts which are the subject of this investment policy statement.    \n  1 This section is adapted from documents of the CFA Institute that were made available to the authors in draft \nform. They may differ from the final published documents. \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   985bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   985 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n986   1b.    Define the investor:  \n  Define who the investor is, be it a natural person or legal/corporate entity. \n  Example: \u201cThis Investment Policy Statement governs the personal investment \nportfolios of Mr. Chen Guangping.\u201d   \n  Specify which of the investors\u2019 assets are to be governed by the IPS. \n  Example: \u201cInvestment portfolios governed by this Investment Policy Statement include all portfolios established in Jorge Castillo\u2019s name, in his name with joint rights of survivorship with Maria Castillo, charitable remainder trusts estab-lished by Jorge Castillo, and uniform gift to minors accounts established for the benefit of Jorge Castillo, Jr. and Cynthia Castillo.\u201d    \n   1c.   Define the structure:  \n  Set forth key responsibilities and actors. \n  Example: \u201cJanice Jones, as financial advisor to Sam and Mary Smith, is respon-sible for coordinating updates to the Investment Policy, including soliciting input from the designated tax and legal advisors to Sam and Mary Smith. Ms. Jones is also responsible for monitoring application of the Investment Policy Statement, and shall promptly notify Sam and Mary Smith of the need for updates to the Policy and/or violations of the Policy in implementation. Sam and Mary Smith shall be responsible for approving the Investment Policy Statement and all subsequent revisions to it.\u201d   \n  Set forth a \u201cstandard of care\u201d for those serving as advisor.  Regulations in differ-\nent jurisdictions may allow for advisors to abide by different standards depending on their preferences, business models, and client preferences. Fiduciary standards generally require that advisors always hold client interests as foremost, whereas suitability standards require recommendations that are suitable for an investor based on the advisor\u2019s knowledge of that investor\u2019s circumstances. Investors may not per-ceive or understand the distinction in the absence of addressing the issue in the Investment Policy Statement.\n  Example: \u201cFuji Advisors acts as a fiduciary in its capacity as advisor to the \nTakesumi Family Accounts, and acknowledges that all advice and decisions  Desirable Components of an Investment Policy Statement \nfor Individual Investors \n  SCOPE AND PURPOSE: \n   Define the Context  \n  Define the Investor    Define the Structure    \n  GOVERNANCE: \n   Specify responsibility for determining investment \npolicy  \n  Describe process for review of IPS    Describe responsibility for engaging/discharging \nexternal advisers  \n  Assign responsibility for determination of asset \nallocation  \n  Assign responsibility for risk management      INVESTMENT, RETURN, AND RISK \nOBJECTIVES: \n   Describe overall investment objective  \n  State return, distribution, and risk requirements    Describe relevant constraints    Describe other relevant considerations    \n  RISK MANAGEMENT \n   Establish performance measurement \naccountabilities  \n  Specify appropriate metrics for risk measurement    Define a process by which portfolios are rebalanced     WORDS FROM THE STREET \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   986bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   986 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 987\nrendered must reflect first and foremost the best interests of its clients. Fuji \nAdvisors also affirms its compliance as a firm with the CFA Institute Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct.\u201d   \n  Identify a risk management structure applicable to investing. \n  Example: \u201cSusan Smith, as investment advisor to Russell Roberts, is respon-sible for monitoring investment risks and reporting them to Russell Roberts in the reporting format that has been agreed to, a sample of which is presented in Appendix XX.\u201d       \n    2.   Governance \n    2a.   Specify who is responsible for determining investment policy, executing invest-\nment policy, and monitoring the results of implementation of the policy.  The \nIPS documents accountability for all stages of investment policy development and implementation. It can reinforce the obligations of advisors to offer counsel and principals to ultimately approve or disapprove of the policy.\n  Example: \u201cAs trustee for the Charitable Remainder Trust, Nigel Brown is \nresponsible for approval of the investment policy and any subsequent changes to it. In their capacity as counselors to the Trust, Tower Advisors shall counsel the trustee as to development of the Investment Policy, suggest appropriate revisions to the Investment Policy on an ongoing basis, and monitor and report on results achieved from implementation of the Policy on no less than a monthly basis.\u201d    \n   2b.   Describe the process for review and updating of the IPS. A process for refreshing \nthe IPS as investor circumstances and/or market conditions change should be \nclearly identified in advance. \n  Example: \u201cWanda Wood is responsible for monitoring the investing require-\nments of Sam and Susan Smith as well as investment and economic issues, and for suggesting changes to the IPS as necessary. Wanda Wood shall review the IPS no less frequently than annually with Sam and Susan Smith.\u201d    \n   2c.   Describe the responsibilities for engaging or discharging external advisors.  The \nIPS should set forth who is responsible for hiring and firing external money manag-\ners, consultants, or other vendors associated with the investment assets.\n  Example: \u201cMarcel Perrold delegates exclusive authority to his financial advisor \nFrancois Finault to retain and dismiss individuals and/or firms to manage his investment assets. Francois Finault shall, prior to hiring any external investment manager, disclose in writing to Marcel Perrold any compensation or other con-sideration received or due to be received from the external investment manager.\u201d    \n   2d.   Assign responsibility for determination of asset allocation, including inputs used \nand criteria for development of input assumptions.  An asset allocation framework \nprovides strategic context to many of the more tactical investment decisions. Asset allocation policies are likely to change over time as characteristics of the inves-tor change and as market circumstances vary. Accordingly, the IPS may reference an Asset Allocation Policy as an appendix, which can be revised without requir-ing approval of an entirely new IPS. It is appropriate for the IPS to address the assumptions used in developing and selecting inputs to the asset allocation decision process.\n  Example: \u201cAt least annually, Tower Advisors shall review the asset allocation \nof the Family Investment Accounts, and suggest revisions for final approval by James and Jennifer Jensen. The asset allocation plan is incorporated as Appen-dix A to this Investment Policy Statement, and shall consider the proportions of investments in cash equivalents, municipal securities, US fixed income obliga-tions, US large capitalization equities, US small capitalization equities, and \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   987bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   987 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n988 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nAmerican Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Tower Advisors shall consider expected \nreturns and correlation of returns for a broad representation of asset classes in the US capital markets, as well as anticipated changes in the rate of inflation, and changes in marginal tax rates.\u201d    \n   2e.   Assign responsibility for risk management, monitoring, and reporting.  The IPS \nshould document who is responsible for setting risk policy, monitoring the risk pro-\nfile of the investment portfolio, and reporting on portfolio risk.\n  Example: \u201cAs investment advisor, Tower Capital is responsible for using \nthe statements prepared by CCC Brokerage as a basis for evaluating the risk profile of the Jorge Luiz account, consistent with the risk management policies approved and adopted by Jorge Luiz (see Appendix ZZZ). Tower Capital shall be responsible for identifying variances in risk positions that exceed tolerable limits as specified in the risk management policies, and taking prompt correc-tive action. No less than quarterly, Tower Capital shall provide to Jorge Luiz a reporting of all such variances in the prior quarter.\u201d       \n    3.   Investment, Return, and Risk Objectives \n    3a.   Describe overall investment objective.  The IPS should relate the purpose of the \nassets being invested to a broad investment objective.\n  Example: \u201cThe investment program governed by the IPS is intended to supple-ment the earned income of Marcel Perrold in satisfying ongoing living expenses as well as to provide for funds upon his retirement in 2026.\u201d    \n   3b.   State the return, distribution, and risk requirements.  \n  State the overall investment performance objective.  Careful specification of the \noverall investment performance objective is likely to incorporate descriptions of general funding needs as well as relations to key factors (such as inflation, spending rate, etc.).\n  Example: \u201cThe financial plan developed for Margarita Mendez indicates a \nrequired real growth rate of 4% to satisfy her future obligations and allow her to\u00a0retire in 2027 as planned.\u201d   \n  Identify performance objectives for each asset class eligible for investment.  \nThe Investment Policy Statement should set forth all permissible asset classes in which the portfolio may be invested. Some investors may find benefit in employing techniques to risk-adjust the benchmark return and portfolio return for purposes of comparison. Note that some asset classes may not be employed at all times, but they should still be identified in the IPS. For each asset class, a brief description of the class should be provided, and a benchmark for performance identified. Within each asset class, there may be sub-asset classes (for example, US Large Cap equity as a sub-asset class of US equity). Descriptions and benchmarks for sub-asset classes may be identified in the IPS, or reserved for an Asset Allocation Plan that may be attached as an appendix.\n  Example: \u201cThe Family Trust accounts may invest in US equity, US fixed \nincome, US money market, and Developed Country international equity securi-ties. The following benchmarks have been selected for comparison to each asset class: US equity: Russell 3000 index. US fixed income: Barclays US Aggregate Index. US money market: Lipper US Government Money Market Average. Developed Country international equity securities: MSCI EAFE index.\u201d   \n  Define distribution/spending assumptions or policies.  Spending or distributions \nfrom the portfolio should be defined. Often, a \u201cspending calculus\u201d that reconciles investment return objectives, fees, taxes, inflation, and anticipated spending is useful \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   988bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   988 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 989\nto document as a guide to realistic assumptions. Distributions may be  characterized \nas a percentage of portfolio market value or as a specific cash value.\n  Example: \u201cBased on the overall expected portfolio return of 7.5%, fees of 1.2%, \ninflation of 2.8%, and an effective tax rate of 32% of total appreciation, the Linzer Trust Portfolio may support an annual spending rate of 1.2% of the portfolio mar-ket value while retaining potential for capital preservation or nominal growth.\u201d   \n  Define a policy portfolio to serve as a basis for performance and risk assessments.   \nAn asset allocation policy should designate target allocations to each asset class, with \nallowable ranges around the targets. Similar targets and ranges may be specified for sub-asset classes. Overall fund returns, weighted according to strategic target alloca-tions, may be constructed and compared to overall actual fund performance. Similarly, some insight as to risk exposures may be developed from examining deviations from target allocations and violations of acceptable ranges of deviation.\n  Example: \u201cAn asset allocation plan for the Mendez Charitable Trust is attached \nas Exhibit ZZZ, and shall be subject to periodic review and change under the sole authority of Jose Carrios as trustee. For each asset class, a target allocation has been established that reflects the optimized asset allocation study con-ducted by Hill Counsel as investment advisors, as well as allowable ranges from which actual allocations to each asset class may vary. The investment advisor is responsible for adhering to the asset allocation plan and for maintaining actual allocations to asset classes within the ranges established.\u201d    \n   3c.   Define the risk tolerance of the investor.  \n  Describe the investor\u2019s general philosophy regarding tolerance of risk.  The IPS \nshould acknowledge the assumption of risk, and the potential for returns associ-ated with risk to be both positive and negative over time. Relevant risks are usually myriad, and may include liquidity, legal, political, regulatory, longevity, mortality, business, and/or health risks. Beyond specifying relevant risks, defining acceptable paths of risk may also be important: volatility as a descriptive measure of risk may be irrelevant beyond an absolute level of loss that completely derails an investment portfolio given personal (i.e., loss of job, disability, life cycle stage) risks. \n For individuals, assessing risk tolerance may be difficult and subjective. Where \npossible, the IPS should account for known liabilities to lend some quantitative basis to the risk tolerance assessment. Individual investors may also require assessment of intellectual and emotional tolerance for potential losses associated with risks, using interviews or questionnaires. More nuanced approaches may attempt to define multiple levels of risks associated with avoiding financial catastrophe, maintaining a current standard of living, or developing significant further wealth. The results of this sort of analysis may suggest boundaries for tolerance for risk and associ-ated policies (for example, stop-loss or rebalancing policies). Such policies may be incorporated by reference in an Appendix.\n  Example: \u201cJames and Jennifer Jensen seek to generate investment returns that \nare proportionate to the risks assumed in the Family Trust portfolios, under-standing that the very nature of risk is uncertainty about the future, and spe-cifically, the uncertainty as to future investment returns. Tower Advisors, as investment advisor, seeks to implement an investment strategy that balances the need to grow the Family Trust assets consistent with the objectives identified in the Financial Plan with the risks associated with that strategy. Tower Advisors understands that an absolute loss in any 12 month period of more than  2 33% is \nintolerable, and policies and procedures to minimize subsequent risk of further loss should be implemented by Tower Advisors at that threshold.\u201d    \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   989bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   989 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n990 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n   3d.   Describe relevant constraints.  Investors must address a variety of constraints that \naffect their investment programs. Such constraints may reflect legal or regulatory \nimperatives, or may reflect internal policies. Often, such constraints are closely linked to particular risks that are relevant to the investor. \n  Define an evaluation horizon for achievement of performance objectives.  Although relatively short time periods may be used for monitoring performance, establishing a minimum time horizon for achievement of performance objectives makes clearer when action may need to be taken to resolve underperformance issues.\n  Example: \u201cThe investment advisor will provide the Family Trust trustees with a \nquarterly report that summarizes the performance of each investment manager, each asset class, and the Family Trust in its entirety. The basis for evaluation of relative success in achieving investment objectives will be on a rolling 8-quarter basis.\u201d   \n  Identify any requirements for maintaining liquidity.   Investors may have short or \nmedium term needs for cash, which should be specified in the IPS if they are ongo-\ning requirements.\n  Example: \u201cAll dividend and interest income will be transferred to the James \nJensen checking account at the end of each month. In addition, up to 15% of the market value of the portfolio should be invested such that it could be liquidated upon 5 days\u2019 notice without suffering capital depreciation.\u201d   \n  Identify to what extent, if any, tax considerations shall affect investment \n decision making.  In some instances, the tax consequences of an investment deci-sion may significantly change the desirability of the proposed transaction. The investor\u2019s general tax situation as well as specific tax issues should be accounted for in the Investment Policy Statement.\n  Example: \u201cIn general, it will be the investment policy for the Wen portfolios \nto invest for appreciation in the taxable individual accounts, and invest for dividend and interest income in the individual retirement accounts. In addition, the investment advisor shall consider tax harvesting of existing high-basis hold-ings as holdings in similar industries or sectors are considered, secondary to the primary investment objective of the purchase/sale decision.\u201d   \n  Identify any relevant legal constraints. \n  Example: \u201cManagement of the Aquilla Family Foundation account is subject to the provisions of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act.\u201d   \n  Specify any policies related to leverage.  The ability to leverage portfolios may be \nconstrained by policy or relevant statute. Any such constraints should be identified. In addition, to the extent that different manager portfolios and/or different asset classes have different leverage allowances, accountability for monitoring overall leverage should be defined.\n  Example: \u201cAt the discretion of Tower Advisors as investment manager, the Xie \nWeng portfolio may be margined up to 50% of its value.\u201d    \n   3 e .   Describe other considerations relevant to investment strategy.  \n  State the investment philosophy.  The IPS should document the investor\u2019s philo-\nsophical approach to investing, which may include such dimensions as market efficiency; the degree of opportunism anticipated; desirability for inclusion of envi-ronmental, social, and/or governance factors in decision making; etc.\n  Example for an Individual Investor: \u201cJames and Judy Jensen have as a philo-\nsophical basis for investment the conviction that markets are efficient, and thus active management of assets is unlikely to add value beyond the short term \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   990bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   990 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 991\nnet of investment costs. Further, James and Judy Jensen believe in a long term \norientation to their investment program and do not intend to seek to exploit investment opportunities that may exist in the very short term, given their belief in their inability to consistently do so profitably.\u201d   \n  Identify special factors to be used in including or excluding potential invest-\nments from the portfolio.  Investors may choose to impose limits on certain invest-ments, consistent with their beliefs in extrafinancial factor effects on securities prices, a desire to avoid concentrated risks in a particular industry, or to be con-sistent with their philosophical or political orientation of the organization. In par-ticular, use of Environmental, Social, or Governance (ESG) factors is increasingly common, and such use should be explicitly allowed or disallowed in the Invest-ment Policy Statement. Islamic clients may choose to restrict investment activity to shariah-compliant investments.\n  Example for an Individual Investor: \u201cConsistent with her personal beliefs, no \ninvestments in companies that derive revenue from products or services that are contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church will be made for Jennifer Jensen\u2019s account. The investment advisor will be responsible for reviewing the portfolio monthly to assure that this requirement is satisfied, and shall immedi-ately dispose of any portfolio holding found to be in violation of this policy.\u201d       \n    4 .    Risk Management \n    4a.   Establish performance measurement and reporting accountabilities.   The IPS \nshould establish an objective, reliable mechanism for reporting on investment \nperformance.\n  Example for an Individual Investor: \u201cHill Counsel, as investment advisor to the \nCharitable Remainder Trust, will calculate the performance of each investment account under its supervision and report to the trustees by the 15th day of the new quarter. Calculations will be performed consistent with the Global Invest-ment Performance Standards published by CFA Institute.\u201d    \n   4b.   Specify appropriate metrics for risk measurement and evaluation.  Consistent use \nof metrics to assess and evaluate the risk profile of investment portfolios is impor-\ntant to allow for meaningful comparisons over time and avoid inappropriate use of different metrics to highlight or disguise certain risks. There is reasonable debate over the suitability of various metrics, and continued review of the choice of metrics is recommended as a strategic imperative.\n  Example for an Individual Investor: \u201cIn addition to performance reporting, \nTower Capital shall report to the Marcel Family Trust trustees on a quarterly basis indicative risk metrics, calculated as the annualized standard deviation of portfolio returns relative to each portfolio\u2019s specified benchmark; and the infor-mation ratio for each portfolio based on annualized returns for the portfolio and benchmark as of the end of each quarter.\u201d    \n   4c.   Define a process by which portfolios are rebalanced to target allocations.   Outside \nboundaries of acceptable variations from target, or another target rebalancing point \nshould be documented in the Investment Policy Statement. The rebalancing mecha-nism may be integrated with the risk management system in some cases, in which case a brief description of the rebalancing policy with reference to the risk manage-ment process in a separate Appendix is likely to be appropriate. If the policy is not to rebalance, this should also be documented in the IPS.\n  Example for an Individual Investor: \u201cOn the first business day of each new \nquarter, the investment advisor for the Jensen personal accounts will propose \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   991bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   991 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n992 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nrebalancing transactions to return the accounts to their target allocations, and \nshall execute these transactions within two business days of receiving authori-zation from the Investment Committee, except that if the principal value of a proposed rebalancing transaction is less than $50,000, that rebalancing transac-tion will be deferred indefinitely.\u201d           \n   28.4 Asset Allocation \n  Consideration of their objectives and constraints leads investors to a set of investment poli-\ncies. The policies column in  Table\u00a028.3  lists the various dimensions of portfolio manage-ment policymaking\u2014asset allocation, diversification, risk and tax positioning, and income generation. By far the most important part of policy determination is asset allocation, that is, deciding how much of the portfolio to invest in each major asset category. \n We can view the process of asset allocation as consisting of the following steps:\n    1. Specify asset classes to be included in the portfolio. The major classes usually \n considered are the following:\n     a.  Money market instruments (usually called  cash ).  \n    b.  Fixed-income securities (usually called  bonds ).  \n    c.  Stocks.  \n    d.  Real estate.  \n    e.  Precious metals.  \n    f.   Other.    \n   Institutional investors will rarely invest in more than the first four categories, \nwhereas individual investors may include precious metals and other more exotic \ntypes of investments in their portfolios.  \n   2. Specify capital market expectations. This step consists of using both historical data \nand economic analysis to determine your expectations of future rates of return over the relevant holding period on the assets to be considered for inclusion in the portfolio.  \n   3. Derive the efficient portfolio frontier. This step consists of finding portfolios that \nachieve the maximum expected return for any given degree of risk.  \n   4. Find the optimal asset mix. This step consists of selecting the efficient portfolio that \nbest meets your risk and return objectives while satisfying the constraints you face.      \n   Taxes and Asset Allocation \n Until this point we have glossed over the issue of income taxes in discussing asset alloca-tion. Of course, to the extent that you are a tax-exempt investor such as a pension fund, or if all of your investment portfolio is in a tax-sheltered account such as an individual retire-ment account (IRA), then taxes are irrelevant to your portfolio decisions. \n But let us say that at least some of your investment income is subject to income taxes at \nthe highest rate under current U.S. law. You are interested in the after-tax holding-period return (HPR) on your portfolio. At first glance it might appear to be a simple matter to figure out what the after-tax HPRs on stocks, bonds, and cash are if you know what they are before taxes. However, there are several complicating factors. \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   992bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   992 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n Looking to Lower Your Risk? Just Add More \n If you\u2019re like a lot of investors these days, you\u2019re looking to \nmake your portfolio \u201cless risky.\u201d \n The way to do that is by adding more risk, or at least \nmore types of risk. That strange twist\u2014adding more to get \nless\u2014is why risk is one of the hardest elements of investing to understand. \n The first rule in risk is the hardest for many investors to \naccept: There is no such thing as a \u201crisk-free investment.\u201d \n Avoiding one form of risk means embracing another; \nthe safest of investments generally come with the lowest \nreturns, while the biggest potential gainers bring larger potential losses. \n The primary risks in fund investing include the \nfollowing. \n  Market risk:  This is the big one, also known as princi-\npal risk, and it\u2019s the chance that downturn chews up your \nmoney. \n  Purchasing power risk:  Sometimes called \u201cinflation \nrisk,\u201d this is the \u201crisk of avoiding risk,\u201d and it\u2019s at the oppo-\nsite end of the spectrum from market risk. In a nutshell, this is the possibility that you are too conservative and your money won\u2019t grow fast enough to keep pace with inflation. \n  Interest-rate risk:  This is a key factor in an environ-\nment of declining rates, where you face potential income \ndeclines when a bond or certificate of deposit matures and you need to reinvest the money. \n Goosing returns using higher-yielding, longer-term \nsecurities creates the potential to get stuck losing ground \nto inflation if the rate trend changes again. \n  Timing risk:  This is another highly individual factor, \nrevolving around your personal time horizon. Simply put, \nthe chance of stock mutual funds making money over the next 20 years is high; the prospects for the next 18 months are murky. \n If you need money at a certain time, this risk must be \nfactored into your asset allocation. \n  Liquidity risk:  Another risk heightened by current ten-\nsions, it affects everything from junk bonds to foreign \nstocks. If world events were to alter the flow of money in credit markets or to close some foreign stock exchanges for an extended period, your holdings in those areas could be severely hurt. \n  Political risk:  This is the prospect that government deci-\nsions will affect the value of your investments. Given the \ncurrent environment, it is probably a factor in all forms of investing, whether you are looking at stocks or bonds. \n  Societal risk:  Call this \u201cworld-event risk.\u201d It was evident \nwhen the first anthrax scares sent markets reeling briefly. \nSome businesses are more susceptible (airlines, for exam-ple), though virtually all types of investing have some con-cerns here. \n Even after all of those risks, some investments face cur-\nrency risk, credit risk, and more. Every type of risk deserves \nsome consideration as you build your holdings. \n Ultimately, by making sure that your portfolio addresses \nall types of risk\u2014heavier on the ones you prefer and lighter \non those that make you queasy\u2014you ensure that no one type of risk can wipe you out. \n That\u2019s something that a \u201cless risky\u201d portfolio may not \nbe able to achieve. \n  Source:  Abridged from Charles A. Jaffee\u2019s article of the same title, \n Boston Sunday Globe,  October 21, 2001. BOSTON SUNDAY GLOBE \n(\u201cGLOBE STAFF\u201d/\u201cCONTRIBUTING REPORTER\u201d PRODUCED COPY ONLY) by CHARLES A.

WORDS FROM THE STREET \n993 The first is the fact that you can choose between tax-exempt and taxable bonds. We \ndiscussed this issue in Chapter 2 and concluded there that you will choose to invest in tax-\nexempt bonds (i.e., municipal bonds) if your personal tax rate is such that the after-tax rate of interest on taxable bonds is less than the interest rate on \u201cmunis.\u201d \n The second complication is not quite so easy to deal with. It arises from the fact that \npart of your HPR is in the form of a capital gain or loss. Under the current tax system you pay income taxes on a capital gain only if you  realize  it by selling the asset during the \nholding period. This applies to bonds as well as stocks, and it makes the after-tax HPR a function of whether the security will actually be sold at the end of the holding period. Sophisticated investors time the realization of their sales of securities to minimize their tax burden. This often calls for selling securities that are losing money at the end of the tax year and holding on to those that are making money. \n Furthermore, because cash dividends on stocks are fully taxable and capital gains \ntaxes can be deferred by not selling stocks that appreciate in value, the after-tax HPR on stocks will depend on the dividend payout policies of the corporations that issued the stock.    \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   993bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   993 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n994 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n   28.5 Managing Portfolios of Individual Investors \n  The overriding consideration in individual investor goal-setting is one\u2019s stage in the \nlife cycle. Most young people start their adult lives with only one asset\u2014their earning power. In this early stage of the life cycle an individual may not have much interest in investing in stocks and bonds. The needs for liquidity and preserving safety of principal dictate a conservative policy of putting savings in a bank or a money market fund. The purchase of life and disability insurance will be required to protect the value of human capital. \n When labor income grows to the point at which insurance and housing needs are met, \nsaving for retirement may begin, especially if the government provides tax incentives for such savings. Retirement savings typically constitute a family\u2019s first pool of investable funds. This is money that can be invested in stocks, bonds, and real estate (other than the primary home).  \n   Human Capital and Insurance \n The first significant investment decision for most individuals concerns education, building up their human capital. The major asset most people have during their early working years is the earning power that draws on their human capital. In these circumstances, the risk of illness or injury is far greater than the risk associated with financial wealth. \n The most direct way of hedging human capital risk is to purchase insurance. With the \ncombination of your labor income and a disability insurance policy viewed as a portfolio, the rate of return on this portfolio is less risky than the labor income by itself. Life insur-ance is a hedge against the complete loss of income as a result of death of any of the fam-ily\u2019s income earners.  \n  Investment in Residence \n The first major economic asset many people acquire is their own house. Deciding to buy rather than rent a residence qualifies as an investment decision. \n An important consideration in assessing the risk and return aspects of this investment \nis the value of a house as a hedge against two kinds of risk. The first kind is the risk of increases in rental rates. If you own a house, any increase in rental rates will increase the return on your investment. \n The second kind of risk is that the particular house or apartment where you live may not \nalways be available to you. By buying, you guarantee its availability.  \n  Saving for Retirement and the Assumption of Risk \n People save and invest money to provide for future consumption and leave an estate. The primary aim of lifetime savings is to allow maintenance of the customary standard of liv-ing after retirement. As  Figure\u00a028.2  suggests, your retirement consumption depends on your life expectancy at that time. Life expectancy, when one makes it to retirement at age 65, approximates 85 years, so the average retiree needs to prepare a 20-year nest egg and sufficient savings to cover unexpected health care costs. Investment income may also increase the welfare of one\u2019s heirs, favorite charity, or both.  \n Questionnaires suggest that attitudes shift away from risk tolerance and toward risk \naversion as investors near retirement age. With age, individuals lose the potential to recover from a disastrous investment performance. When they are young, investors can respond to a loss by working harder and saving more of their income. But as retirement approaches, investors realize there will be less time to recover. Hence the shift to safe assets.  \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   994bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   994 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 995\n  Retirement Planning Models \n In recent years, investment companies and finan-\ncial advisory firms have created a variety of \u201cuser-\nfriendly\u201d interactive tools and models for retirement \nplanning. Although they vary in detail, the essential \nstructure behind most of them can be explained using \nthe American Saving Education Council\u2019s \u201cBallpark \nEstimate\u201d worksheet (see  Figure\u00a0 28.3 ). The work-\nsheet assumes you\u2019ll need 70% of current income, \nthat you\u2019ll live to age 87, and you\u2019ll realize a constant \nreal rate of return of 3% after inflation. For example, \nlet\u2019s say Jane is a 35-year-old working woman with \ntwo children, earning $30,000 per year. Seventy \npercent of Jane\u2019s current annual income ($30,000) \nis $21,000. Jane would then subtract the income she \nexpects to receive from Social Security ($12,000 in \nher case) from $21,000, equaling $9,000. This is how \nmuch Jane needs to make up for each retirement year. \nJane expects to retire at age 65, so (using panel 3 of \nthe worksheet) she multiplies $9,000\u00a0 3 \u00a016.4 equal-\ning $147,600. Jane has already saved $2,000 in her \n401(k) plan. She plans to retire in 30 years so (from panel 4) she multiplies $2,000\u00a0 3 \u00a02.4 \nequaling $4,800. She subtracts that from her total, making her projected total savings needed \nat retirement $142,800. Jane then multiplies $142,800\u00a0 3 \u00a0.020\u00a0 5 \u00a0$2,856 (panel 6). This is the \namount Jane will need to save annually for her retirement.    \n Figure 28.2 Long life expectancy is a double-\nedged sword \n  Source:   www.glasbergen.com   .

CONCEPT CHECK 28.1 \n  Manage Your Own Portfolio or Rely on Others? \n Lots of people have assets such as Social Security benefits, pension and group insurance \nplans, and savings components of life insurance policies. Yet they exercise limited control, \nif any, on the investment decisions of these plans. The funds that secure pension and life \ninsurance plans are managed by institutional investors. \n Outside the \u201cforced savings\u201d plans, however, individuals can manage their own invest-\nment portfolios. As the population grows richer, more and more people face this decision. \n Managing your own portfolio  appears   to be the lowest-cost solution. However, against \nthe fees and charges that financial planners and professional investment managers impose, \nyou will want to offset the value of your time and energy expended on diligent portfolio \nmanagement. Most of all, you must recognize the  potential   difference in investment results. \n Besides the need to deliver better-performing investments, professional managers face \ntwo added difficulties. First, getting clients to communicate their objectives and constraints \nrequires considerable skill. This is not a one-time task because objectives and constraints \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   995bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   995 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n996 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n1.

WORDS FROM THE STREET \n997are forever changing. Second, the professional needs to articulate the financial plan and \nkeep the client abreast of outcomes. Professional management of large portfolios is com-plicated further by the need to set up an efficient organization where decisions can be decentralized and information properly disseminated. The nearby box presents some ques-tions to consider when looking for an investment advisor. \n The task of life cycle financial planning is a formidable one for most people. It is not \nsurprising that a whole industry has sprung up to provide personal financial advice.   \n  Tax Sheltering \n In this section we explain three important tax sheltering options that can radically affect opti-mal asset allocation for individual investors. The first is the tax-deferral option, which arises from the fact that you do not have to pay tax on a capital gain until you choose to realize the gain. The second is tax-deferred retirement plans such as individual retirement accounts, and the third is tax-deferred annuities offered by life insurance companies. Not treated here at all is the possibility of investing in the tax-exempt instruments discussed in Chapter 2. \n  The Tax-Deferral Option   A fundamental feature of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code \nis that tax on a capital gain on an asset is payable only when the asset is sold; this is its \n   tax-deferral option    .  The investor therefore can control the timing of the tax payment. This \nconveys a benefit to stock investments. \n To see this, compare IBM stock with an IBM bond. Suppose both offer an expected \ntotal return of 12%. The stock has a dividend yield of 4% and expected price appreciation of 8%, whereas the bond pays an interest rate of 12%. The bond investor must pay tax on the bond\u2019s interest in the year it is earned, whereas the stockholder pays tax only on the dividend and defers paying capital gains tax until the stock is sold. \n Suppose one invests $1,000 for 5 years. Although in reality interest is taxed as ordinary \nincome while capital gains and dividends are taxed at a rate of only 15% for many inves-tors,  \n2   to isolate the benefit of tax deferral, we will assume that all investment income is \n  2 As of 2013, the tax rate on capital gains and dividends is 15% for married couples earning between $72,500 and \n$250,000. At incomes above $250,000, a 3.8% Medicare surtax on investment income is added, and for incomes \nabove $450,000, the tax rate is 20% (plus the 3.8% surtax). \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   997bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   997 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n998 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\ntaxed at 15%.

The \nafter-tax accumulation at the end of 5 years is    \n$1,00031.10255$1,625.20  \n For the stock, the dividend yield after taxes is 4%\u00a0 3 \u00a0(1\u00a0 2  \u00a0.15)\u00a0 5  \u00a03.4%. Because no taxes \nare paid on the 8% annual capital gain until year 5, the before-tax accumulation will be   \n$1,0003(11.0341.08)551,000 (1.114 )55$1,715.64  \n In year 5, when the stock is sold, the (now-taxable) capital gain is   \n$1,715.64 2$1,000 (1.034 )551,715.64 21,181.96 5$533.68  \n Taxes due are $80.05, leaving $1,635.59, which is $10.39 more than the bond investment \nyields. Deferral of the capital gains tax allows the investment to compound at a faster rate until the tax is actually paid. Note that the more of one\u2019s total return that is in the form of price appreciation, the greater the value of the tax-deferral option.  \n  Tax-Deferred Retirement Plans   Recent years have seen increased use of    tax-\ndeferred retirement plans    in which investors can choose how to allocate assets. Such \nplans include traditional IRAs, Keogh plans, and employer-sponsored \u201ctax-qualified\u201d \ndefined contribution plans such as 401(k) plans. A feature they have in common is that contributions and earnings are not subject to federal income tax until the individual with-draws them as benefits. \n Typically, an individual may have some investment in the form of such qualified retire-\nment accounts and some in the form of ordinary taxable accounts. The basic investment principle that applies is to hold whatever bonds you want to hold in the retirement account while holding equities in the ordinary account. You maximize the tax advantage of the retirement account by holding it in the security that is the least tax advantaged. \n To see this point, consider an investor who has $200,000 of wealth, $100,000 of it in a \ntax-qualified retirement account. She currently invests half of her wealth in bonds and half in stocks, so she allocates half of her retirement account and half of her nonretirement funds to each. She could reduce her tax bill with  no change  in before-tax returns simply by shifting her \nbonds into the retirement account and holding all her stocks outside the retirement account. \n  \n Suppose our investor earns a 10% per year rate of interest on bonds and 15% per year on stocks, all in the \nform of price appreciation. In 5 years she will withdraw all her funds and spend them. By how much will she increase her final accumulation if she shifts all bonds into the retirement account and holds all stocks outside the retirement account? She is in a 28% tax bracket for ordinary income, and her capital gains income is taxed at 15%.  CONCEPT CHECK 28.2 \n  Deferred Annuities      Deferred annuities    are essentially tax-sheltered accounts \noffered by life insurance companies. They combine deferral of taxes with the option of \nwithdrawing one\u2019s funds in the form of a life annuity. Variable annuity contracts offer the additional advantage of mutual fund investing. One major difference between an IRA and a variable annuity contract is that whereas the amount one can contribute to an IRA is tax-deductible and extremely limited as to maximum amount, the amount one can contribute to a deferred annuity is unlimited, but not tax-deductible. \n The defining characteristic of a life annuity is that its payments continue as long as the \nrecipient is alive, although virtually all deferred annuity contracts have several withdrawal \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   998bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   998 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 999\noptions, including a lump sum of cash paid out at any time. You need not worry about \nrunning out of money before you die. Like Social Security, therefore, life annuities offer longevity insurance and thus would seem to be an ideal asset for someone in the retirement years. Indeed, theory suggests that where there are no bequest motives, it would be optimal for people to invest heavily in actuarially fair life annuities.  \n3    \n There are two types of life annuities,    fixed annuities    and    variable annuities    .  A fixed \nannuity pays a fixed nominal sum of money per period (usually each month), whereas a variable annuity pays a periodic amount linked to the investment performance of some underlying portfolio. \n Variable annuities are structured so that the investment risk of the underlying asset port-\nfolio is passed through to the recipient, much as shareholders bear the risk of a mutual fund. There are two stages in a variable annuity contract: an accumulation phase and a payout phase. During the  accumulation  phase, the investor contributes money periodically \nto one or more open-end mutual funds and accumulates shares. The second, or  payout,  \nstage usually starts at retirement, when the investor typically has several options, including the following:\n    1. Taking the market value of the shares in a lump sum payment.  \n   2. Receiving a fixed annuity until death.     3. Receiving a variable amount of money each period that depends on the investment \nperformance of the portfolio.     \n  Variable and Universal Life Insurance   Variable life insurance is another tax-\ndeferred investment vehicle offered by the life insurance industry. A variable life insurance \npolicy combines life insurance with the tax-deferred annuities described earlier. \n To invest in this product, you pay either a single premium or a series of premiums. \nIn each case there is a stated death benefit, and the policyholder can allocate the money invested to several portfolios, which generally include a money market fund, a bond fund, and at least one common stock fund. The allocation can be changed at any time. \n Variable life insurance policies offer a death benefit that is the greater of the stated \nface value or the market value of the investment base. In other words, the death benefit may rise with favorable investment performance, but it will not go below the guaranteed face value. Furthermore, the surviving beneficiary is not subject to income tax on the death benefit. \n The policyholder can choose from a number of income options to convert the policy \ninto a stream of income, either on surrender of the contract or as a partial withdrawal. In all cases income taxes are payable on the part of any distribution representing investment gains. \n The insured can gain access to the investment without having to pay income tax by bor-\nrowing against the cash surrender value. Policy loans of up to 90% of the cash value are available at any time at a contractually specified interest rate. \n A universal life insurance policy is similar to a variable life policy except that, instead \nof having a choice of portfolios to invest in, the policyholder earns a rate of interest that is set by the insurance company and changed periodically as market conditions change. The disadvantage of universal life insurance is that the company controls the rate of return to the policyholder, and, although companies may change the rate in response to competitive pressures, changes are not automatic. Different companies offer different rates, so it often pays to shop around for the best.     \n  3 For an elaboration of this point see Laurence J. Kotlikoff and Avia Spivak, \u201cThe Family as an Incomplete \nAnnuities Market,\u201d  Journal of Political Economy  89 (April 1981). \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   999bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   999 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1000 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n   28.6 Pension Funds \n  Pension plans are defined by the terms specifying the \u201cwho,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d and \u201chow much,\u201d for \nboth the plan benefits and the plan contributions used to pay for those benefits. The  pen-\nsion fund  of the plan is the cumulation of assets created from contributions and the invest-ment earnings on those contributions, less any payments of benefits from the fund. In the United States, contributions to the fund by either employer or employee are tax-deductible, and investment income of the fund is not taxed. Distributions from the fund, whether to the employer or the employee, are taxed as ordinary income. There are two \u201cpure\u201d types of pension plans:  defined contribution  and  defined benefit.   \n   Defined Contribution Plans \n In a defined contribution plan, a formula specifies contributions made by and on behalf of employees but does not promise the benefits to which they will be entitled. Contribution rules usually are specified as a predetermined fraction of salary (e.g., the employer con-tributes 10% of the employee\u2019s annual wages to the plan), although that fraction need not be constant over the course of an employee\u2019s career. The pension fund consists of a set of individual investment accounts, one for each employee. Pension benefits are not specified, other than that at retirement the employee may apply that total accumulated value of con-tributions and earnings on those contributions to purchase an annuity. The employee often has some choice over both the level of contributions and the way the account is invested. \n In principle, contributions could be invested in any security, although in practice most \nplans limit investment choices to bond, stock, and money market funds. The employee bears all the investment risk, and the employer has no legal obligation beyond making its periodic contributions. \n For defined contribution plans, investment policy is essentially the same as for a tax-\nqualified individual retirement account. Indeed, the main providers of investment products for these plans are the same institutions such as mutual funds and insurance companies that serve the general investment needs of individuals. Therefore, in a defined contribution plan much of the task of setting and achieving the income-replacement goal falls on the employee.   \n An employee is 45 years old. Her salary is $40,000 per year, and she has $100,000 accumulated in her self-\ndirected defined contribution pension plan. Each year she contributes 5% of her salary to the plan, and her employer matches it with another 5%. She plans to retire at age 65. The plan offers a choice of two funds: a guaranteed return fund that pays a risk-free real interest rate of 3% per year and a stock index fund that has an expected real rate of return of 6% per year and a standard deviation of 20%. Her current asset mix in the plan is $50,000 in the guaranteed fund and $50,000 in the stock index fund. She plans to reinvest all investment earnings in each fund in that same fund and to allocate her annual contribution equally between the two funds. If her salary grows at the same rate as the cost of living, how much can she expect to have at retirement? How much can she be  sure  of having?  CONCEPT CHECK 28.3 \n  Defined Benefit Plans \n Whereas defined contribution plans specify the contributions made on behalf of employ-\nees, defined benefit plans specify the retirement  benefits  to which the employee is enti-\ntled. The firm is responsible for ensuring that funding will be adequate to provide those \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1000bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1000 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 1001\nbenefits. The benefit formula typically takes into account years of service for the employer \nand level of wages or salary (e.g., an employer might pay an employee for life, beginning at age 65, a yearly amount equal to 1% of his final annual wage for each year of service). The employer (called the  plan sponsor ) or an insurance company hired by the sponsor \nguarantees the benefits and thus absorbs the investment risk. \n As measured both by number of plan participants and the value of total pension liabili-\nties, the defined benefit form still dominates in most countries around the world. However, the strong trend since the mid-1970s has been for sponsors to choose the defined contri-bution form when starting new plans. But the two plan types are not mutually exclusive. Many sponsors adopt defined benefit plans as their primary plan, in which participation is mandatory, and supplement them with voluntary defined contribution plans. \n With defined benefit plans, there is an important distinction between the pension  plan  \nand the pension  fund.  The plan is the contractual arrangement setting out the rights and \nobligations of all parties; the fund is a separate pool of assets set aside to provide collateral for the promised benefits. There may be no separate fund, in which case the plan is said to be unfunded. When there is a separate fund with assets worth less than the present value of the promised benefits, the plan is underfunded. And if the plan\u2019s assets have a market value that exceeds the present value of the plan\u2019s liabilities, it is said to be overfunded. \n  \n An employee is 40 years old and has been working for the firm for 15 years. If normal retirement age is 65, \nthe interest rate is 8%, and the employee\u2019s life expectancy is 80, what is the present value of the accrued pension benefit?  CONCEPT CHECK 28.4 \n  Pension Investment Strategies \n The special tax status of pension funds creates the same incentive for both defined contri-\nbution and defined benefit plans to tilt their asset mix toward assets with the largest spread between pretax and after-tax rates of return. In a defined contribution plan, because the participant bears all the investment risk, the optimal asset mix also depends on the risk tolerance of the participant. \n In defined benefit plans, optimal investment policy may be different because the spon-\nsor absorbs the investment risk. If the sponsor has to share some of the upside potential of the pension assets with plan participants, there is an incentive to eliminate all investment risk by investing in securities that match the promised benefits. If, for example, the plan sponsor has to pay $100 per year for the next 5 years, it can provide this stream of benefit payments by buying a set of five zero-coupon bonds each with a face value of $100 and maturing sequentially. By so doing, the sponsor eliminates the risk of a shortfall. This is an example of    immunization    of the pension liability. \n If the present value of promised pension benefits exceeds the market value of its \nassets, FASB Statement 87 requires that the corporation recognize the unfunded liability on its balance sheet. If, however, the pension assets exceed the present value of obliga-tions, the corporation cannot include the surplus on its balance sheet. This asymmetric accounting treatment expresses a deeply held view about defined benefit pension funds. Representatives of organized labor, some politicians, and even a few pension professionals believe that the sponsoring corporation, as guarantor of the accumulated pension benefits, is liable for pension asset shortfalls but does not have a clear right to the entire surplus in case of pension overfunding. \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1001bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1001 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n1002 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\n  Investing in Equities   If the only goal guiding corporate pension policy were share-\nholder wealth maximization, it is hard to understand why a financially sound pension \nsponsor would invest in equities at all. The tax advantage of a pension fund stems from the ability of the sponsor to earn the pretax interest rate on pension investments. To maxi-mize the value of this tax shelter, it is necessary to invest entirely in assets offering the highest pretax interest rate. These will be the most tax  dis advantaged assets, meaning that \ncorporate pension funds should invest entirely in taxable bonds and other fixed-income investments. \n Yet we know that in general pension funds invest from 40% to 60% of their portfolios in \nequity securities. Even a casual perusal of the practitioner literature suggests that they do so for a variety of reasons\u2014some right and some wrong. There are three possible correct reasons. \n The first possibility is that corporate management views the pension plan as a trust for \nthe employees and manages fund assets as if it were a defined contribution plan. It believes that a successful policy of investment in equities might allow it to pay extra benefits to employees and is therefore worth taking the risk. \n The second possible correct reason is that management believes that through supe-\nrior market timing and security selection it is possible to create value in excess of man-agement fees and expenses. Many executives in nonfinancial corporations are used to creating value in excess of cost in their businesses. They assume that it can also be done in the area of portfolio management. Of course, if that is true, then one must ask why they do not do it on their corporate account rather than in the pension fund. That way they could have their tax shelter \u201ccake\u201d and eat it too. It is important to real-ize, however, that to accomplish this feat, the plan must beat the market, not merely match it. \n Note that a very weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis would imply that man-\nagement cannot create shareholder value simply by shifting the pension portfolio out of bonds and into stocks. Even when the entire pension surplus belongs to the shareholders, investing in stocks just moves the shareholders along the capital market line (the market trade-off between risk and return for passive investors) and does not create value. When the net cost of providing plan beneficiaries with shortfall risk insurance is taken into account, increasing the pension fund equity exposure reduces shareholder value unless the equity investment can put the firm above the capital market line. This implies that it makes sense for a pension fund to invest in equities only  if  it is able to pursue an active strategy that \nbeats the market either through superior timing or security selection. A completely passive strategy will add no value to shareholders. \n For an underfunded plan of a corporation in financial distress there is another pos-\nsible reason for investing in stocks and other risky assets\u2014federal pension insurance. Firms in financial distress have an incentive to invest pension fund money in the risk-iest assets, just as troubled thrift institutions insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) in the 1980s had similar motivation with respect to their loan portfolios.  \n  Wrong Reasons to Invest in Equities   The wrong reasons for a pension fund to \ninvest in equities stem from interrelated fallacies. The first is the notion that stocks are not \nrisky in the long run. This fallacy was discussed at length in Chapter 5. Another related fallacy is the notion that stocks are a hedge against inflation. The reasoning behind this fal-lacy is that stocks are an ownership claim over real physical capital. If real profits are either unaffected or enhanced when there is unanticipated inflation, owners of real capital should not be hurt by it. However, empirical studies show that stock returns have demonstrated low or even negative correlation with inflation. Thus, the case for stocks as an inflation hedge is weak.     \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1002bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1002 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\n CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 1003\n   28.7 Investments for the Long Run \n  As the aged population around the world grows more rapidly than any other age group, \nissues of saving for the long run, for the most part surrounding retirement, have come to the fore of the investments industry. Traditionally, the advice for the long run could be summa-rized by rules of thumb concerning various rates of gradual, age-determined shifts in asset allocation from risky to safe assets. Implications of \u201cmodern\u201d portfolio management, now more than 30 years old, originated from Merton\u2019s lifetime consumption/investment model (ICAPM) suggesting that one consider hedge assets to account for extramarket sources of risk, such as inflation, and needs emanating from uncertain longevity.  \n   Target Investing and the Term Structure of Bonds \n Interest rates usually vary by maturity. For example, a person considering investing money in an insured certificate of deposit or a Treasury security will observe that the interest rate she can earn depends on its maturity. Thus, for any given target date there is a different risk-free interest rate. Each investor, with a unique horizon, therefore has his or her own risk-free asset. For Mr. Short it is bills and for Ms. Long it is bonds. Thus, to accommodate investors with different time horizons, there must be a menu of choices that has a term structure of risk-free investments. The principle of duration matching means matching one\u2019s assets to one\u2019s objectives (liabilities) and is equivalent to the immunization strategy for pension funds that we examined in Chapter 16. \n In what unit of account should the risk-free term structure be denominated? This is a \ncritical issue because a bond is risk-free only in terms of a specified numeraire (unit of account), such as dollars, yen, and so on. Thus, if a bond promises to pay $100 two years from now, its payoff in terms of yen depends on the dollar price of the yen 2 years from now, and vice versa. Thus even a zero-coupon bond with no default risk can still be very risky if it is denominated in a unit of account (such as a foreign currency) that does not match the investor\u2019s goal. This type of risk is called \u201cbasis risk.\u201d \n To illustrate, assume the goal is retirement. If the goal is specified as a level of real wealth at \nthe retirement date, then the unit of account should be consumption units. The risk-free asset in this case would be a bond with a payoff linked to an index of consumer prices, such as the CPI. However, if the index chosen does not truly reflect the specific investor\u2019s future cost of living, there will be some risk. If the goal is to maintain a certain standard of living for the rest of one\u2019s life, then instead of a fixed level of retirement wealth in terms of consumption units, a more appropriate unit of account would be a lifetime  flow  of real consumption. This can be computed \nby dividing dollar amounts by the market price of a lifetime real annuity that starts paying benefits at the target retirement date. The term structure is then given by the prices of lifetime real annuities with different starting dates. Similarly, education bonds that are linked to the cost of college education would provide the appropriate unit of account for children\u2019s college funds.  \n  Making Simple Investment Choices \n A target-date retirement fund (TDRF) is a fund of funds diversified across stocks and bonds with the feature that the proportion invested in stocks is automatically reduced as time passes.  \n4   TDRFs are often advocated as the simple solution to the complex task \n  4 Vanguard describes its TDRFs as follows: \u201cWith Target Retirement Funds, you have only one decision to make: \nwhen you plan to retire. Your Target Retirement Fund automatically grows more conservative as your retire-\nment date nears. When you are ready to draw income in your retirement, your Target Retirement Fund has a stable, income-oriented mix of assets.\u201d From \u201cChoose a Simple Solution: Vanguard Target Retirement Funds,\u201d    \nwww.vanguard.com/jumppage/retire   .  \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1003bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1003 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm1004 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nof determining the appropriate asset allocation among funds in 401(k) plans, IRAs, and \nother personal investment accounts. TDRFs are marketed as enabling investors to put their investment plans on autopilot. Once you choose a fund with a target year matching your horizon, the life cycle manager moves some of your money out of stocks and into bonds as your retirement date nears.\n   \n  Inflation Risk and Long-Term Investors \n While inflation risk is usually low for short horizons, it is a first-order source of risk for retirement planning, where horizons may be extremely long. An inflation \u201cshock\u201d may last for many years, and impart substantial uncertainty to the purchasing power of any dollar you (or your client) have saved for retirement. \n A conventional answer to the problem of inflation risk is to invest in price-indexed \nbonds such as TIPS (see Chapter 14 for a review). This is a good first step but is not a full answer to inflation risk. A zero-coupon priced-indexed bond with maturity equal to an investor\u2019s horizon would be a riskless investment in terms of purchasing power. This can be achieved with CPI-indexed savings bonds, but the government limits the amount of such bonds one may buy in any year. Unfortunately, market-traded TIPS bonds are not risk-free. As the (real) interest rate changes, the value of those bonds will fluctuate. Moreover, these bonds pay coupons, so the accumulated (real) value of the portfolio is subject to reinvestment-rate risk. These issues should remind you of our discussion of bond risk in Chapter 16. In this context too, one must balance price risk with reinvestment rate risk by tailoring the duration of the bond portfolio to the investment horizon. But in this case, we need to calculate duration using the real interest rate and focus on real pay-offs from our investments.     \n    1 .  When the principles of portfolio management are discussed, it is useful to distinguish among \nseven classes of investors:\n     a .   Individual investors and personal trusts.  \n    b .   Mutual funds.  \n    c.  Pension funds.  \n    d.  Endowment funds.  \n    e .   Life insurance companies.  \n    f .   Non\u2013life insurance companies.  \n    g .   Banks.    \n   In general, these groups have somewhat different investment objectives, constraints, and portfolio \npolicies.  \n   2 .  To some extent, most institutional investors seek to match the risk-and-return characteristics of their investment portfolios to the characteristics of their liabilities.  \n   3 .  The process of asset allocation consists of the following steps:\n     a .   Specifying the asset classes to be included.  \n    b .   Defining capital market expectations.  \n    c.  Finding the efficient portfolio frontier.  \n    d.  Determining the optimal mix.

People living on money-fixed incomes are vulnerable to inflation risk and may want to hedge \nagainst it. The effectiveness of an asset as an inflation hedge is related to its correlation with unanticipated inflation.  \n   5. For investors who must pay taxes on their investment income, the process of asset allocation is complicated by the fact that they pay income taxes only on certain kinds of investment income. Interest income on munis is exempt from tax, and high-tax-bracket investors will prefer to hold them rather than short- and long-term taxable bonds. However, the really difficult part of the tax effect to deal with is the fact that capital gains are taxable only if realized through the sale of an asset during the holding period. Investment strategies designed to avoid taxes may conflict with the principles of efficient diversification.  \n   6. The life cycle approach to the management of an individual\u2019s investment portfolio views the individual as passing through a series of stages, becoming more risk averse in later years. The rationale underlying this approach is that as we age, we use up our human capital and have less time remaining to recoup possible portfolio losses through increased labor supply.  \n   7. People buy life and disability insurance during their prime earning years to hedge against the risk associated with loss of their human capital, that is, their future earning power.  \n   8. There are three ways to shelter investment income from federal income taxes besides investing in tax-exempt bonds. The first is by investing in assets whose returns take the form of apprecia-tion in value, such as common stocks or real estate. As long as capital gains taxes are not paid until the asset is sold, the tax can be deferred indefinitely. \n The second way of tax sheltering is through investing in tax-deferred retirement plans such \nas IRAs. The general investment rule is to hold the least tax-advantaged assets in the plan and the most tax-advantaged assets outside of it. \n The third way of sheltering is to invest in the tax-advantaged products offered by the life \ninsurance industry\u2014tax-deferred annuities and variable and universal life insurance. They com-bine the flexibility of mutual fund investing with the tax advantages of tax deferral.  \n   9. Pension plans are either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Defined contribu-tion plans are in effect retirement funds held in trust for the employee by the employer. The employees in such plans bear all the risk of the plan\u2019s assets and often have some choice in the allocation of those assets. Defined benefit plans give the employees a claim to a money-fixed annuity at retirement. The annuity level is determined by a formula that takes into account years of service and the employee\u2019s wage or salary history.  \n   10. If the only goal guiding corporate pension policy were shareholder wealth maximization, it would be hard to understand why a financially sound pension sponsor would invest in equities at all. A policy of 100% bond investment would both maximize the tax advantage of funding the pension plan and minimize the costs of guaranteeing the defined benefits.  \n   11. If sponsors viewed their pension liabilities as indexed for inflation, then the appropriate way for them to minimize the cost of providing benefit guarantees would be to hedge using securities whose returns are highly correlated with inflation. Common stocks would not be an appropriate hedge because they have a low correlation with inflation.

Your neighbor has heard that you successfully completed a course in investments and has come \nto seek your advice. She and her husband are both 50 years old. They just finished making their \nlast payments for their condominium and their children\u2019s college education and are planning for \nretirement. What advice on investing their retirement savings would you give them? If they are \nvery risk averse, what would you advise?    \n    2. What is the least-risky  a sset for each of the following investors?\n     a .   A person investing for her 3-year-old child\u2019s college tuition.  \n    b .

A defined benefit pension fund with benefit obligations that have an average duration of \n10 years. The benefits are inflation-protected.     \n   3. George More is a participant in a defined contribution pension plan that offers a fixed-income \nfund and a common stock fund as investment choices. He is 40 years old and has an accumulation \nof $100,000 in each of the funds. He currently contributes $1,500 per year to each. He plans to \nretire at age 65, and his life expectancy is age 80.\n     a .   Assuming a 3% per year real earnings rate for the fixed-income fund and 6% per year for \ncommon stocks, what will be George\u2019s expected accumulation in each account at age 65?  \n    b .   What will be the expected real retirement annuity from each account, assuming these same \nreal earnings rates?  \n    c.  If George wanted a retirement annuity of $30,000 per year from the fixed-income fund, by \nhow much would he have to increase his annual contributions?     \n   4. The difference between a Roth IRA and a conventional IRA is that in a Roth IRA taxes are paid \non the income that is contributed but the withdrawals at retirement are tax-free.

Based \nin London, Acme has operations in North America, Japan, and several European countries. \nNext month, the retirement age for full benefits under the plan will be lowered from age 60 \nto age 55. \n The median age of Acme\u2019s workforce is 49 years. Walker is responsible for the pension \nplan\u2019s inv estment policy and strategic asset allocation decisions. The goals of the plan \ninclude achieving a minimum expected return of 8.4% with expected standard deviation no \ngreater than 16.0%. \n Walker is evaluating the current asset allocation ( Table\u00a028A ) and selected financial informa-\ntion for the company ( Table\u00a028B ). There is an ongoing debate within Acme Industries about the \npension plan\u2019s investment policy statement (IPS). Two investment policy statements under con-\nsideration are shown in  Table\u00a028C .\n     a .

For several years, GSS has worked for a broad array of clients, including employee \nbenefit plans, wealthy individuals, and charitable organizations. Also, the firm expresses expertise in managing stocks, bonds, cash reserves, real estate, venture capital, and international securities. To date, the firm has not utilized a formal asset allocation process but instead has relied on the individual wishes of clients or the particular preferences of its portfolio managers. Short recom-mends to GSS management that a formal asset allocation process would be beneficial and empha-sizes that a large part of a portfolio\u2019s ultimate return depends on asset allocation. He is asked to take his conviction an additional step by making a proposal to executive management.\n     a .   Recommend and justify an approach to asset allocation that could be used by GSS.  \n    b .   Apply the approach to a middle-aged, wealthy individual characterized as a fairly conserva-\ntive investor (sometimes referred to as a \u201cguardian investor\u201d).     \n   5. Jarvis University (JU) is a private, multiprogram U.S. university with a $2 billion endowment fund \nas of fiscal year-end May 31, 2019. With little government support, JU is heavily dependent on its endowment fund to support ongoing expenditures, especially because the university\u2019s enrollment growth and tuition revenue have not met expectations in recent years. The endowment fund must make a $126 million annual contribution, which is indexed to inflation, to JU\u2019s general operating budget. The U.S. Consumer Price Index is expected to rise 2.5% annually and the U.S. higher edu-cation cost index is anticipated to rise 3% annually. The endowment has also budgeted $200 million due on January 31, 2020, representing the final payment for construction of a new main library. \n In a recent capital campaign, JU only met its fund-raising goal with the help of one very  successful \nalumna, Valerie Bremner, who donated $400 million of Bertocchi Oil and Gas  common stock at fis-cal year-end May 31, 2019. Bertocchi Oil and Gas is a large-capitalization, publicly traded U.S. company. Bremner donated the stock on the condition that no more than 25% of the initial number of shares may be sold in any fiscal year. No substantial additional donations are expected in the future. \n Given the large contribution to and distributions from the endowment fund, the endowment \nfund\u2019s investment committee has decided to revise the fund\u2019s investment policy statement. The investment committee also recognizes that a revised asset allocation may be warranted. The asset allocation in place for the JU endowment fund as of May 31, 2019, is given in  Table\u00a028E .\n     a .   Prepare the components of an appropriate investment policy statement for the Jarvis  University \nendowment fund as of June 1, 2019, based only on the information given. \n       Note:  Each component in your response must specifically address circumstances of the JU \nendowment fund.

Susan Fairfax is president of Reston Industries, a U.S.-based company whose sales are entirely \ndomestic and whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The following are addi-tional facts concerning her current situation:\n   \u2022  Fairfax is single, aged 58. She has no immediate family, no debts, and does not own a resi-\ndence. She is in excellent health and covered by Reston-paid health insurance that continues after her expected retirement at age 65.  \n  \u2022  Her base salary of $500,000/year, infl  ation-protected, is suffi  cient to support her present lifestyle but can no longer generate any excess for savings.  \n  \u2022  She has $2,000,000 of savings from prior years held in the form of short-term instruments.  \n  \u2022  Reston rewards key employees through a generous stock-bonus incentive plan but provides no pension plan and pays no dividend.  \n  \u2022  Fairfax\u2019s incentive plan participation has resulted in her ownership of Reston stock worth $10 million (current market value). The stock, received tax-free but subject to tax at a 35% rate (on entire proceeds) if sold, is expected to be held at least until her retirement.  \n  \u2022  Her present level of spending and the current annual infl  ation rate of 4% are expected to continue after her retirement.  \n  \u2022  Fairfax is taxed at 35% on all salary, investment income, and realized capital gains. Assume her composite tax rate will continue at this level indefi  nitely.    \n   Fairfax\u2019s orientation is patient, careful, and conservative in all things. She has stated that an \nannual after-tax real total return of 3% would be completely acceptable to her if it was achieved in a context where an investment portfolio created from her accumulated savings was not subject to a decline of more than 10% in nominal terms in any given 12-month period. To obtain the benefits of professional assistance, she has approached two investment advisory firms\u2014HH Counselors (\u201cHH\u201d) and Coastal Advisors (\u201cCoastal\u201d)\u2014for recommendations on allocation of the investment portfolio to be created from her existing savings assets (the \u201cSavings Portfolio\u201d) as well as for advice concerning investing in general.\n     a .   Create and justify an investment policy statement for Fairfax based only on the information \nprovided thus far. Be specific and complete in presenting objectives and constraints. (An asset allocation is not required in answering this question.)  \n    b .   Coastal has proposed the asset allocation shown in  Table\u00a0 28F  for investment of Fairfax\u2019s $2\u00a0 million of savings assets. Assume that only the current yield portion of projected total return (comprised of both investment income and realized capital gains) is taxable to Fairfax and that the municipal bond income is entirely tax-exempt. \n Critique the Coastal proposal.

Fol-\nlowing his wife\u2019s recent death and settlement of the estate, Mr. Franklin owns a controlling inter-est in a successful privately held manufacturing company in which Mrs. Franklin was formerly active, a recently completed warehouse property, the family residence, and his personal holdings of stocks and bonds. He has decided to retain the warehouse property as a diversifying investment but intends to sell the private company interest, giving half of the proceeds to a medical research foundation in memory of his deceased wife. Actual transfer of this gift is expected to take place about 3 months from now. You have been engaged to assist him with the valuations, planning, and portfolio building required to structure his investment program appropriately. \n Mr. Franklin has introduced you to the finance committee of the medical research foundation \nthat is to receive his $45 million cash gift 3 months hence (and will eventually receive the assets of his estate). This gift will greatly increase the size of the foundation\u2019s endowment (from $10 million to $55 million) as well as enable it to make larger grants to researchers. The foundation\u2019s grant-making (spending) policy has been to pay out virtually all of its annual net investment income. As its investment approach has been very conservative, the endowment portfolio now consists almost entirely of fixed-income assets. The finance committee understands that these actions are causing the real value of foundation assets and the real value of future grants to decline due to the effects of inflation. Until now, the finance committee has believed that it had no alternative to these actions, given the large immediate cash needs of the research programs being funded and the small size of the foundation\u2019s capital base. The foundation\u2019s annual grants must at least equal 5% of its assets\u2019 market value to maintain its U.S. tax-exempt status, a requirement that is expected to continue indefinitely. No additional gifts or fund-raising activities are expected over the foreseeable future. \n Given the change in circumstances that Mr. Franklin\u2019s gift will make, the finance committee \nwishes to develop new grant-making and investment policies. Annual spending must at least meet the level of 5% of market value that is required to maintain the foundation\u2019s tax-exempt status, but the committee is unsure about how much higher than 5% it can or should be. The committee wants to pay out as much as possible because of the critical nature of the research being funded; however, it understands that preserving the real value of the foundation\u2019s assets is equally impor-tant in order to preserve its future grant-making capabilities. You have been asked to assist the committee in developing appropriate policies.\n     a .   Identify and briefly discuss the three key elements that should determine the foundation\u2019s \ngrant-making (spending) policy.  \n    b .   Formulate and justify an investment policy statement for the foundation, taking into account the increased size of its assets arising from Mr. Franklin\u2019s gift. Your policy statement must encom-pass all relevant objectives, constraints, and the key elements identified in your answer to part ( a ).  \n    c.  Recommend and justify a long-term asset allocation that is consistent with the investment policy statement you created in part ( b ). Explain how your allocation\u2019s expected return meets \nthe requirements of a feasible grant-making (spending) policy for the foundation. ( Hint:  \nYour allocation must sum to 100% and should use the economic/market data presented in  Table\u00a028H  and your knowledge of historical asset-class characteristics.)     \n   8. Christopher Maclin, aged 40, is a supervisor at Barnett Co. and earns an annual salary of \u00a380,000 \nbefore taxes. Louise Maclin, aged 38, stays home to care for their newborn twins. She recently inherited \u00a3900,000 (after wealth-transfer taxes) in cash from her father\u2019s estate. In addition, the Maclins have accumulated the following assets (current market value):\n   \u2022  \u00a35,000 in cash.  \n  \u2022  \u00a3160,000 in stocks and bonds.  \n  \u2022  \u00a3220,000 in Barnett common stock.    \nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1011bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1011 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm1012 PART VII  Applied Portfolio Management\nHistoric \nAveragesIntermediate Term \nConsensus Forecast\nU.S. Treasury bills 3.7% 4.2%\nIntermediate-term U.S. T-bonds 5.2 5.8\nLong-term U.S. T-bonds 4.8 7.7\nU.S. corporate bonds (AAA)  5.5 8.8\nNon-U.S. bonds (AAA) N/A 8.4\nU.S. common stocks (all) 10.3 9.0\nU.S. common stocks (small-cap) 12.2 12.0\nNon-U.S. common stocks (all) N/A 10.1\nU.S. inflation   3.1 3.5\nTable 28H\nCapital markets annualized return data\n   The value of their holdings in Barnett stock has appreciated substantially as a result of the com-\npany\u2019s growth in sales and profits during the past 10 years. Christopher Maclin is confident that \nthe company and its stock will continue to perform well. \n The Maclins need \u00a330,000 for a down payment on the purchase of a house and plan to make \na \u00a320,000 non\u2013tax deductible donation to a local charity in memory of Louise Maclin\u2019s father. The Maclins\u2019 annual living expenses are \u00a374,000. After-tax salary increases will offset any future increases in their living expenses. \n During their discussions with Grant Webb, the Maclins\u2019 express concern about achieving their \neducational goals for their children and their own retirement goals. The Maclins tell Webb:\n   \u2022  They want to have suffi  cient funds to retire in 18 years when their children begin their \n4 years of university education.  \n  \u2022  They have been unhappy with the portfolio volatility they have experienced in recent years and they do not want to experience a loss greater than 12% in any one year.  \n  \u2022  They do not want to invest in alcohol and tobacco stocks.  \n  \u2022  They will not have any additional children.    \n   After their discussions, Webb calculates that in 18 years the Maclins will need \u00a32 million to meet \ntheir educational and retirement goals. Webb suggests that their portfolio be structured to limit shortfall risk (defined as expected total return minus two standard deviations) to no lower than a  2 12% return in any one year. Maclin\u2019s salary and all capital gains and investment income are \ntaxed at 40% and no tax-sheltering strategies are available. Webb\u2019s next step is to formulate an investment policy statement for the Maclins.\n     a .   Formulate the risk objective of an investment policy statement for the Maclins.  \n    b .   Formulate the return objective of an investment policy statement for the Maclins. \nCalculate the pretax rate of return that is required to achieve this objective. Show your calculations.  \n    c.  Formulate the constraints portion of an investment policy statement for the Maclins, address-ing each of the following:\n    i. Time horizon  \n   ii. Liquidity requirements     iii. Tax concerns     iv. Unique circumstances        \n   9. Louise and Christopher Maclin have purchased their house and made the donation to the local \ncharity. Now that an investment policy statement has been prepared for the Maclins, Grant Webb recommends that they consider the strategic asset allocation described in  Table\u00a028I .\nbod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1012bod61671_ch28_977-1014.indd   1012 7/31/13   7:25 PM7/31/13   7:25 PMFinal PDF to printer\nVisit us at www.mhhe.com/bkm CHAPTER 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute 1013\nAsset ClassRecommended \nAllocation Current YieldProjected \nAnnualized Pretax \nTotal ReturnExpected \nStandard \nDeviation\nCash 15.0% 1.0% 1.0% 2.5%\nU.K. corporate bonds 55.0 4.0 5.0 11.0\nU.K. small-capitalization equities 0.0 0.0 11.0 25.0\nU.K. large-capitalization equities 10.0 2.0 9.0 21.0\nU.S. equities* 5.0 1.5 10.0 20.0\nBarnett Co. common stock 15.0 1.0 16.0 48.0\nTotal portfolio 100.0 \u2014 6.7 12.4\nTable 28I\nLouise and Christopher Maclin\u2019s recommended strategic asset allocation\n*U.S. equity data are in British pound terms.\n     a .
